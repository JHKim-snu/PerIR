            "Very much the same experience with somebody in Braintree, MA. Again, probably a bad idea to name names, but I'm sure you can figure out who I mean with a little research. \n Couple anecdotes: The interview featured questions like \"describe yourself.\" When I asked, \"um, in what sense do you mean?\" they come back with \"we just wanted to see what you do with that.\" Hurr durr. \n Surprise, surprise, they say that the next phase of the interview is shadowing somebody for a whole fucking day. I surmise that for a lot of desperate people, the time investment is part of getting them hooked. \n Obvious set-up: First interview of the day buys a bunch of shit and is very friendly. Has clearly met the woman, we'll call her \"Kate,\" I was with before. \n Absolutely no fucking luck the rest of the day driving around Haverhill. (And what the fuck are we doing out there if we're based in Braintree anyway?) \n Incredibly obvious bad sign number two: Go for lunch at local pizzeria. I'm expecting them to buy me lunch, call me crazy. I order a couple of slices and a coke. \"Kate\" munches on pop-tarts, doesn't pay. Yeah, clearly this is my hot ticket to the top. \n Later: Spend about an hour poking around a warehouse-type building looking for open offices. Dusty stairwells and sweating. Golly gee, I'm getting excited for this job! \n Later still (about 5 p.m.): Walking through several \"no soliciting\" signs in other warehouse building with loading docks for semis on the front. \"Kate\" reprises earlier theme of not handing out business cards, not giving out phone number because \"we're not salesmen, we're marketers,\" whatever the fuck that means.": "IAmA",
            "A lot of this is correct, but there's absolutely no point to fitting a gun or anything on a covops, much less for WHs. \n In PvE, there's no sleeper you can possibly kill with your puny DPS, and you will certainly be killed for your efforts. \n In PvP, you're likely to be up against small numbers of well-fitted, well-flown ships.

            "I live in a basement apartment and frequently (maybe once a week) hear the sounds of half of a domestic argument from my next door neighbor's place. (Nothing to indicate anything like violence - I would absolutely have called the cops - I just frequently hear a woman's voice crying and shouting angrily at someone. N.B. my neighbor definitely has a man's name.) \n OK, for months and months, I've just thought to myself, whatever, my neighbor is a douchebag, and it's never been loud enough for long enough to even warrant an irritable knock on the door. \n Then a couple of weeks ago, shit gets real - the \"cops\" (I'll explain in a sec) show up, pound on his door, say they're going to knock it down if he doesn't open up. (They never do.) I get curious because the \"cops\" aren't in uniform, although their badges look real enough to my inexpert eye, and they freely volunteer that neighbor \"stole his sister's medication,\" something I feel like real cops wouldn't be real quick to just tell any random neighbor. Bail agents, maybe? I know it's a really serious crime to impersonate a cop, but you do hear things about those guys. \n Neighbor is still in the apartment, in fact, I just saw him on the stoop with a woman - possibly the angry, sobbing voice I know too well. I work full-time, so I haven't seen/heard anything out of the ordinary since, though there was another little spat a few nights ago. \n I'm just a bit perplexed, Reddit. I'm not asking whether I should call the cops - apart from very, very clear-cut situations as mentioned above, I'm not the guy who calls the cops - I'm just absolutely flabbergasted as to what could possibly be going on. Any thoughts?": "AskReddit",

            "I recently got into it with a couple of people in a comment thread on here about the frequent use of the word \"faggot\" in the insults traded by online SC and SC2 players. (The people I argued with, I should clarify, were perfectly civil about it.) \n I feel like the tolerance for this sort of crap should be much, much more limited than it currently is, and I'm really curious to know why it's not. I tried to put it in the context of building a more general acceptance for esports - my example was if a mainstream sports star publicly called his opponents \"faggots.\" There'd be a shitstorm of major proportions. Anybody remember what happened when even a  retired  NBA player [shot his mouth off about gay people?]( \n Contrast this, then, to the response the SC community has to IdrA, who is one of the top players in the world and frequently refers to his opponents as \"faggots.\" It seems to range from \"oh, that IdraA, boys will be boys\" to \"oh, gee, what a jerk, but that's just IdrA.\" \n And if anybody thinks \"well, that's just part of the game,\" let me just say that I think that's a stupid argument. Not signing black players used to be just part of baseball, but that didn't make it right. \n Non-professionals - you guys/gals don't even have the excuse of being caught up in the heat of a professional game. You're playing for fun, regardless of anything else, and if it gets you angry enough to start hurling homophobic abuse at somebody who annoys you, you should go play something else. \n Professionals - you might have better reasons for getting mad, but you're got a responsibility to the development of your sport not to behave like nose-picking twelve-year-olds. Your paydays will get better the closer SC is to getting a competitive audience. \n I don't give a shit what anybody calls anybody in private, and it's frankly none of my business. But SC - particularly competitive SC - is an increasingly public space, and I think the game would benefit from a little more maturity, from top to bottom.": "starcraft"

            "i think gaming will decentralize. \n 1) Common architectures across three of the big platforms will reduce non-arbitrary exclusives. \n 2) the rise in powerful, small, yet inexpensive hardware seen in mobile phones and tablets relative to \"good enough\" graphics expectations \n 3) Increased use of OpenGL (or other non-platform exclusive graphics APIs) in mobile/indie games \n i think we'll start to see more \"Ouya\"-like devices; they're small, yet powerful enough and potentially similar enough in architecture to run downscaled ports of AAA console titles. \n basically, i don't think that the big three will do anything in particular that will lead to a \"downfall\", but i do feel like more focused, affordable hardware is creeping upwards rather than big broad tech boxes are creeping downwards. i think just as cheap, simple mobile games are cannibalizing the larger games market, cheap, simple tech will start to steal sales from the \"Big Three\". \n most will figure that the graphical fidelity available on 7th gen tech will look \"good enough\", and once small mobile GPUs get to that level, justifying $400-$500 for some additional eye-candy (or features that, while neat, are available in other devices you already own, like your Roku) just won't make sense to most people, even \"core\" gamers. \n EDIT: i'll throw in that i think Nintendo kind of understands this; i think Nintendo's biggest problem is actually a cultural one, as while their devices match what most consumers expect on a hardware level (powerful, mobile tech), their OS functionality has always seemed strange to me (and a bit behind the times). i think this is likely because of a gap in expectations between Japanese and Western markets regarding internet access, etc., but it really took Nintendo a while to catch on to how big \"Online\" really was, and now i feel like they're missing a similar boat by not pushing apps (like Facebook, etc.) enough for the 3DS.": "Gaming4Gamers",
            "you're right, what Valve does isn't fair for people who don't like Steam. the difference here is that Valve isn't almost universally reviled and trying to figure out why. \n Valve gets away with some of the crap they pull (and they do pull shit sometimes) because of all the things they get right. EA hasn't built up that level of consumer/developer trust and good will, so very few people have any patience with them. \n if you want some examples for why Valve is loved and EA is hated, it's not hard to find them. I think what you'll come to find is that while there is definitely some hyperbole, these company's respective reputations are not wholly underserved. \n I imagine that one of the reasons EA is confused about their negative reputation is because they're trying to analyze like your comment does: breaking it down into a case-by-case basis and saying, \"Why can such and such company get away with that when we get nailed?\" but that's not how trust and patience work; trust and patience are made from a much bigger picture over a long period of time. the mob may be fickle over specific events, but negative PR over a long period of time builds up and teaches the mob not to like you. while that mob may be quick to forget or forgive an isolated misstep, asking them to unlearn to hate you is much longer process.": "gaming",
            "Imagine trying to get past silver rank (let's say this is comparable to rank 15 in HS) in SC2 without a pro-designed build order. It would be near-impossible. \n this is absolutely not true. at silver level, most players have trouble pulling off pro-level BOs at all simply because of the mechanical demands of the micro and the necessary familiarity with the nuances of the timings. at that level (and for a while after), it would be far better for players to focus on the fundamentals (such as worker production, scouting, expanding, and aggression vs. teching) than on the fancy footwork pros rely on. \n hell, i was low Diamond when i played, and even at that level it was much more about how effectively you could multi-task and how quickly you could make good judgment calls than on specific builds. \n low-mid level SC2 players are like low-mid level HS players are like any other low-mid level player for a given competitive game: they need to focus on the basics and fundamentals far more than they need to worry about squeezing every bit of optimization out of their deck. \n low level players burning their dust net decking is like a novice cyclist spending thousands of dollars on the kind of cycling gear they use in the Tour de France. a novice cyclist won't have the athleticism or training necessary to utilize those very specific advantages and optimizations granted by that professional gear.": "hearthstone",

            "I know this sort of thing has been tried in the past, but never successfully as far as I'm aware. Many of them are just cutscenes with QTEs littered throughout (Heavy Rain comes to mind) or choose-your-own-adventure stories. Telltale games might be considered (rather good) interactive movies, but they've become kind of their own genre. \n What I'm thinking of is casting the player as action director and stuntman. The player plays the action scenes (things games are good at), and cutscenes play for the character moments (things movies are good at). Some things that I think would help make this work are, in no particular order: \n \n Short runtime, maybe 4 hours split equally between game and cutscene \n Appropriate pricetag, about $20 USD \n The ability to PAUSE, REWIND, FAST-FORWARD, SKIP, and CHAPTER SELECT cutscenes! Any game with cutscenes should have this anyway. \n NO QTEs, so when it switches from game to cutscene you can safely set the controller down and kick back to watch the story play out. \n Linear (or mostly linear) storyline, so the writers can focus on making a good script without having to deal with branching. \n \n In writing this, I've realized that this seems a lot like a condensed version of a Naughty Dog game. In fact, I've seen a few YouTube videos where people have cut Uncharted or The Last Of Us cutscenes and some gameplay into a movie version. However, the gameplay portions of these videos are often awkward to watch because of how long and repetitive gameplay can be. \n One goal of my proposed 'movie-game' would be to keep the gameplay condensed enough to be as interesting to watch as the cutscenes; instead of fighting 50 guys to pad out the gameplay like in a modern 'cinematic' game, just fight 5 guys that are more of a threat. It could help avoid a lot of the narrative dissonance that modern games have, where your 'hero' effortlessly slaughters hundreds of inexhaustible bad guys over the course of the game.": "Games",
            "I recently had an annoying experience with a new monitor and some graphics card management software and I wanted to share it with others so they don't make the same mistakes I did. This seemed like a good place since, if you're visiting this subreddit, you likely have or are interested in the high-end hardware that is affected by these issues. \n A month ago, I purchased an Acer XB270HU. It's awesome. I was worried about pushing 1440p with my pc since I only have one GTX970 (an ASUS Strix), but G-Sync smooths everything out and if I really want to get above 60 FPS regularly I can just drop some of the less important settings a tad. \n However, there was one really frustrating issue I kept having. On occasion I would boot my computer and the monitor would do nothing. Nothing at all. It would stay in power save mode and taunt me with an amber status LED. I tried cycling power, different cables, Frankenstein arrangements of adapters, but the monitor and my gaming pc refused to cooperate. They both worked with other hardware though: the monitor with my laptop, and my pc with my old monitor (over DVI; note that G-Sync monitors only work over DisplayPort). \n I did research; some said that the card might be having handshaking issues with the monitor (can we pause for a moment and consider that in this day and age, monitors are having networking problems?). They recommended updating the VBIOS on the offending card. So I booted up GPU Tweak and hit the \"Update now\" button and got a \"You're up to date!\" \n My mistake was trusting the program. It was only when I filled out a support ticket with ASUS weeks later that I checked the downloads page for my card and saw that I was about 3 VBIOS versions behind.

That's not even mentioning the new weapons, vehicles, modes, and the visual fluff like camos, dog tags, weapon skins,  and  the \"meta\" junk (videos, strategy guides, 2x experience events, wallpapers...) \n Certainly some DLC does the \"psychologist\" thing and chops up less content into more cost. In this case they just release it over time so players don't lose interest in the year (or so) gap between game and expansion pack. \n As far as the less work goes into DLC part, you're probably right. However, less work does not necessarily mean lower quality. The DLC crew already has the style, assets, mechanics, and in some cases, characters and story of the base game to work off of. There's probably also an established workflow within the studio so content is produced faster.": "Games",

            "In my opinion, most of the work of building a PC is done before you even open a box. Research, research, research. Find out what parts are not only compatible, but will complement each other in terms of power. For instance, getting a graphics card and processor that won't bottleneck each other is an important one. Read the guides linked in the sidebar and watch some videos. Browse sites like  Tom's Hardware . \n Don't just compare the specs on the boxes, but find out which parts stand out when they're put through the wringer. A good example of this is [JonnyGURU's]( PSU reviews, where he actually stress tests PSUs with professional electrical test equipment and a temperature control chamber. \n Whether this is difficult or not... well, that's really up to you.

An air-cooled ATX build in a mid-tower case will probably be pretty simple.

            "So in League of Legends, most mages' abilities scale off of something called  Ability Power . For example, let's say I have a skill that does  200 + (.7 Ability Power)  damage and I have 100 Ability Power. This means the skill will do  200 + (.7   100)  damage or  270* damage. Mana, Mana regeneration and Cooldown Reduction are all completely seperate stats from  Ability Power  availible for purchase that also allow mages to scale in to the late game. \n Now in Dota, abilities (in most cases) do not scale off of a stat and are limited to doing only their base damage. Mages also gain damage on their basic attacks for each point of  Intelligence  that they have. Cooldown Reduction is also non existent as a purchasable stat. So with this in mind, how do mages scale into the late game at all? \n It seems like any amount of damage they would be able to do is completely gated by their bases and eventually becomes irrelevant as players get health and resistances late game. It also seems odd that a mage would auto attack at all in order to make use of the bonus damage they get from building  Intelligence , but correct me if this is the case. Additionally, it seems pointless to devote any farm towards an Intelligence hero as they don't scale well with items unlike Strength and Agility heroes do. \n So with all this in mind, am I correct in thinking that a late game mage is really only as useful as the utility on their abilities? I understand I'm probably underestimating the impact of base damages, but I'm having a lot of trouble wrapping my head around a mage's role late game. Are there any mage characters that one would devote lane farm towards and maybe even a lane support? \n I'm very new to the game so my lack of experience is probably playing a large part in this confusion. I've also done a lot of reading on characters and guides without playing which is probably adding to my lack of practical knowledge.": "DotA2",
            "Her kit and role are pretty well defined already as a marksman who compromises damage for CC. She is also one of the best Marksman to learn on since kiting, map awareness and positioning are all things her kit inherently lends itself too. It's just that her two passives don't make a lot of sense, gameplay wise. \n > Focus \n \n If Ashe has not attacked in the last 3 seconds, she gains 4 / 5 / 6 / 7 / 8 Focus stacks per second. At 100 stacks, Ashe will critically strike on her next basic attack. Thereafter, Focus stacks will reset to an amount equal to her critical strike chance. \n This ability just feels very clunky and illogical. It has weird power spikes and is contradictory to your main job as a Marksman, attacking things. In laning you usually want to be constantly auto attacking things whether it be to push the lane, harass enemy champions or even just to last hit minions. Late game it doesn't do that much for you since every other auto attack is basically already a crit. It's more of a level 1 gimmick than anything else at this point. \n > Hawkshot \n \n PASSIVE: Ashe gains bonus gold each time she kills a unit or destroys a structure. \n >BONUS GOLD: 1 / 2 / 3 / 4 / 5 \n >ACTIVE: Ashe animates a hawk to scout for her, granting sight for 2 seconds as it flies towards a target location. Hawkshot grants a 1000-radius area of sight for 5 seconds when it reaches its destination. The sight extends into brushes.** \n The active on this ability is fine, it's just that the passive suffers from similar problems as Ashe's first passive. The extra gold gain seems good in theory, but the ability needs levels for it to be noticeable. However, it would be silly to put your early levels into this ability rather than your W or Q since the active is more or less the same with or without levels during the early game. Basically your putting a passive that is best suited for levels during the laning phase on an active that is best to level late game. You're lucky to come out of the laning phase with 150 CS which is about 150 extra gold from this passive. Not a lot if you ask me. \n I'm not asking for Ashe to get some crazy buff pushing her to become overpowered, but rather small quality of life changes making her gameplay feel a little more logical. I'm looking for something akin to the Morgana changes of 3.13 (where they made her W deal bonus damage based on % missing health rather than shred MR). It's perfecting the kit of an already well balanced champion.": "leagueoflegends",
            "So Zac  is a champion that has seen many nerfs over his time in the league. Adjustments to his base damages, the reduction of tenacity on his ult and making his blobs more contestable. His two favorite items, Sunfire Cape and Spirit Visage, also took some nerfs. Right now Zac is in a better state than a lot of champions, but is overall pretty lacking. \n My idea is to increase the amount that Zac's blobs heal himself for from 4% of max health to 5% of max health. This change mostly exists to balance the previous nerf to his blobs which made them easier to play against. Riot made the risk of getting blobs much higher but didn't increase the reward at all. \n This change would help Zac survive early game while also allowing his scaling into the late game to improve slightly.": "leagueoflegends",
            "Currently the Tribunal is in a Soon ^tm state so that adds to why ranked is so bad right now. We can hope that Riot's (soon?) changes to the Tribunal will help the ranked experience but even still you can't let trolls/feeders/ragers affect you. \n If you look at it statistically, the enemy team actually has a higher chance of having a feeder/troll assuming you aren't one (4/5 vs 5/5). If you can consistently play well in your ranked games you will reach your appropriate level after ~150 matches for sure. \n An issue a lot of people run into is expecting a constant climbing of the ladder. The truth is that unless you are improving, that isn't going to happen. If your playing at a Gold II level, you are not going to surpass Gold II and you don't deserve to. Improving is not easy either. If you feel like you are plateauing and you want to get better, you need to really work at it.": "leagueoflegends",
            "Start the game with a 50 health shield. This shield regenerates each time you respawn.\" \n Runic Blessing is a mastery unique to Season 4. It requires 16 points in the defense tree. It's a really interesting idea for a mastery, but I believe it has been made way to weak in its current state. \n Basically the core issue of this mastery is that 50 HP is not that much. Any jungler using this mastery should not be depending on that 50 HP for a better clear. It's just not going to make the difference. The same goes for laners. 50 HP is rarely ever going to impact the lane. A couple of creep autos and the shield was made useless. \n It also suffers from the same condition as Revive where one has to expect to die to make full use of it. \n There are a couple of possible solutions to this problem. A popular one is to have the shield refresh every time you visit the shop rather than every time you respawn. I think this change could easily be put into action without any problems. \n Another option would be to have the shield scale throughout levels or with a percentage of max health. This would prevent it from being so useless later in the game. \n So I'm just curious what you guys think about this mastery. Does it deserve a buff or is it fine where it is? Thank you for reading!": "leagueoflegends"

            "Yue and Korra (and all Avatars) are both connected with spirits. We all get Korra's connection since it was pretty well explained: Raava \"possessed\" Wan and touching the spirit portal (symbolizing the bridge between humans and spirits) bound them. Thus, Raava didn't possess him for too long and cause any harm. \n Yue's on the other hand is completely different. In her youth, she was only imbued with Tui's power, yet was able to become Tui later on? It doesn't make much sense to me. Tui couldn't have \"possessed\" Yue like Raava did Korra, because she would've been harmed without touching a spirit portal, which she didn't. Therefore, Yue really only got power. Yet, then why could she literally  become  the moon spirit once Tui died? \n The Avatar and Raava are now fused, so Korra can practically be considered Raava or the light spirit, even though this is a bit unintuitive. So, why can Yue do this same thing, even do a greater extent,  replacing  a spirit, when her connection seemed to be so much lesser?": "TheLastAirbender",

So if the USA stops importing from a country, they better be scared shitless their exports and economy are going to tank. Meanwhile, if Albania stops importing from that same country, who cares? \n Also, the effectiveness of the sanctions allows the USA to use them more often.

Laugh, mute them and report them for being abusive. A party won't accept you because you have a low DBR rating? Find another party; chances are they probably aren't very fun/nice people anyway. \n Bad players already get flamed in-game for poor performance. This is not new. If the DBR system really is as accurate as they [Dotabuff] claim and your DBR rating is very low, chances are you have room for improvement in various areas of your play style. So it's time to start reading about the game, how the game mechanics work, how certain heroes work, learning about the items in the game, etc. \n The problem is players who perform poorly get bothered when someone tells them they're making mistakes, and things like this are their worst fear. My thoughts? Get over it. Many of us are bad players or have some room for improvement and that's okay. This will only affect the community if the community lets it, and right now, it seems like a lot of you are letting this get to your heads. \n Some players actually want systems like these so they can see how they are performing against other players. Dota 2 is, at its core, a highly competitive game. This is a feature that many players will legitimately use to see where they can improve and gauge their performance accordingly.": "DotA2",

AMD has actually been the sole contributor of the scam that is \"next generation\" consoles which are now sold to clueless and uneducated gamers. \n People like to bash on Nvidia now because of the Forbes article which denounces GameWorks but people fail to understand that AMD have an equally \"evil\" technology named Mantle, a low-level framework that only works on GCN cards.

I saw that it was flagged as Early Access and after trying Starbound I thought \"hey, how bad can it actually be?\" \n I learned my lesson. I will never buy Early Access games again. The good moments that I did have from the game were completely negated by the terrible bugs, horrible game design issues and some of the worst input mechanics I've ever seen in a video game. Zombies would clip through walls. Server restarts were rampant. Items would not respawn. Game gives you no indication of how thirst and hunger work, so until you look it up outside of the game you're running around, constantly and unrealistically drinking water and eating food. \n I'm glad they finally addressed it, but after playing the game with this update it's obvious the game is still a buggy, unfinished and, quite frankly, poorly designed mess. Basic things like crouching, standing up, going prone, holstering your weapon and sprinting STILL feel incredibly clunky. All of the great ideas that the game has going for it is lost in its terrible execution.": "Games",

By Grade 10 or 11 I was annoying some of my friends by openly questioning some of the things in the bible; most of them just didn't care. \n Eventually I asked another person I knew what he thought about the idea of God (long before the internet was big). His thing was \"The ancient Greeks weren't too smart believing in the gods of mount Olympus.\" Not overly profound in retrospect, but hey -- I'd met another non-believer. \n Seeing Dawkins and Hitches on TV, the growth of the internet all helped me realize how right my hunch was about religion being something man made; that is has the power to control other people and profit off of them.

            "Okay, long back story to get to my question here. Please bare with me on this one. \n So I built out an in place upgrade of Windows 10 following this [guide]( \n It works out flawlessly, though I recommend disabling bitlocker on Surface Pro because they like to brick. \n However the issue I found is that it installs perfectly, keeps all the software and data files. But after a reboot I get a BSOD screen saying SYSTEM_LICENSE_VIOLATION. It runs through automatic repair and fails several times. \n I have found a fix for this though, which is once you are in PE on the fancy blue screen that gives you additional options. I can open cmd prompt and run this command: \n REG LOAD \"HKLM\\temp\" d:\\windows\\system32\\config\\SYSTEM \n This brings up the obvious, the local machine temp hive, then after doing so I can type regedit and pull up and access the temp directory. \n From here I  can go to HKLM\\temp\\Setup and create a new D-WORD 32-bit key called \"SetupType\" and set the value to 0. After a reboot Windows comes up flawlessly, upgraded to 10, all files, software, etc.. etc.. \n So here's my question, how can I add this to my existing task sequence in MDT? \n If I could automate this then I can deploy it by having this at the tail end of the task sequence it would fix running the upgrade on a end user and then having to physically go to the system afterwards and implement the registry fix. \n I thought for sure I could run the commands like this: \n REG LOAD \"HKLM\\temp\" d:\\windows\\system32\\config\\SYSTEM \n REG ADD HKLM\\temp\\Setup /v SetupType /t REG_DWORD /d 0 \n But, A) I don't feel I've typed the REG ADD command correctly, and B) this seems like this has to be done while the system is in PE.

I want my character to fight for the 'right' side, I know it is fair to say that there is no right side but for those of you who are extensively versed in the finer details of Elder Scrolls lore, which is the righteous side?

Having to memorize and visually recognize what Desert Sage or Butterfly Weed looks like and keeping an eye out for them makes you feel like a self-sufficient bad ass gunslinger. When I\u2019m low on medicine, taking a little detour to kill a couple of deer to stock up on vittles is very satisfying. \n I\u2019m just thoroughly impressed that this game holds up so damn well since its release years ago, still feels like a modern game, graphics are still damn impressive, and I can confidently say that this game replicates the west better than any other representation I have ever seen. This game is just a perfect masterpiece on so many levels. \n Just another point I wanted to quickly raise was, I\u2019m sure that you have heard about the bickering going on between Take-Two interactive and Leslie Benzies, from the little I know, it seems like the reason behind Rockstar\u2019s constant success and quality made games is that Leslie Benzies is some kind of game development god? Like he practices dark arts so that every single game he comes near is suddenly game of the year? Apparently the development of Red Dead was absolutely hellish, and after the Houser brothers summoned Benzies he managed to smooth out the kinks and get Red Dead back on track after a month or something? \n So my question is do you think the quality of future Grand Theft Autos and possible Red Dead sequels might dip slightly, or be missing some of that Rockstar quality magic that is sprinkled throughout all of their games because Benzies is no longer part of the company?": "reddeadredemption",

            "I agree with your points completely although for different reasons, recently started playing a bit again (on/off a few times a week). And this is after taking a two or so year break due to boredom. \n To me the SOF is a blatant cash grab, especially due to the convert to coins option. In my first week of playing after coming back i got a cosmetic item with a 2m ctc value. And while that is nice for me and all, the fact that everybody gets two spins a day (more if you farm the challanges) with common values of 10-50k a spin has by its very nature to devalue the economy (and also skills as you mentioned with exp lamps) \n However my biggest problem with rs nowdays is the eoc. I've played a lot of mmos (RS being my first and probably the one i have the fondest memories of), and to me rs was always about having the game open while you watch a movie or listen to a audiobook. Then along comes the EoC pretty much ruining what is probably the best casual mmo combat system i have tried. Imo there is only one good thing to come from the eoc and that is the action bar. It's a feature i would have killed for back in the day (if only for the convenience of being able to toggle prayers/eat/use spells without having to flip through 3-4 different menues). It also added dual wielding witch is a nice feature, but noting perticurlarly groundbreaking. However along with it comes a hotkey based combat system that is seemingly hammered in there in an effort to make the game more like WoW. Suddenly health is based on your gear aswell as your hp (excuse me...  constitution ), monsters are now pretty much immune to the two combat types they are not weak to (take the saradomin/zamorak wizards from lv3 clues, who you can seemingly beat on all day with a whip/excalibur combo). All of that is manageable though as it doesn't impact the game in too negative a way. \nHowever what does in fact kill the game in my opinion is that you are pretty much forced to use one of the least responsive (ie. lag from rs being a browser based game and not a client-serrver solution (not jagex's fault but the solution is ill suited for high speed action based combat))and interesting hotkey based combat systems i have ever tried in a mmo. In my experience you basically set up rotations for each combat type (1h+shield, dual wield, 2h, ranged, magic) and follow that rotation to the letter. None of the skills do anything particurlarly interesting, you might have a dot or a snare, but most of them are simply % modifiers of your regular damage. And combat becomes nothing but follow rotation to 50/100% and use a finisher. \nNow they did give us momentum, however it is far from an ideal solution, it buffs regular combat by 20% and gets disabled if you use any skills. However as using abilities give better dps it is sub-optimal for anything but killing weaker monsters. And with the hotkeys being rather laggy as mentioned above it just makes for a worse experience overall. \n I might just be complaining over nothing here but if i want to play something with high action I'll play dota or something. And runescape has always been that game where i opened up a movie/youtube on the second monitor and killed some slayer monsters, did some barrows runs or possibly some farming.

            "Now that we've all been able to play with our minion summoning alter egos for a while how about we talk about one of the key features of our class, pets. The pet system is by far our most distinguishing trait and as such I at least feel the need to shine a light on some of the more glaring faults and shortcomings. Keep in mind this meant as constructive criticism (and it is also 100% personal opinion so feel free to disagree), so if you disagree with anything I say here, please submit a post detailing why. This is also written from the perspective of someone who is primarily a scholar, but it should be applicable to all archanists. \n \n Issuing pet skills is on gcd despite the skills themselves not being on gcd (our even being our skills). This is more of a slight annoyance at my level (32) however at later levels I can imagine this being a fairly large hindrance. If for example you need to move your pet out of a large damage aoe you will need to stop your current cast before you can issue a place command, nor can you command your pet to use a specific skill (i.e. embrace for scholars) while you yourself is casting. Simply changing it so we could cast pet skills regardless of our own gcd would be a welcome change. \n \n Toggle pet skills. I might be spoiled due to WoW here, but being able to select what abilities you want the pet to autocast would be a great help (yes you can put the pet on obey, but at that point you have to micromanage all the pet skills). Say you want to disable emeralt carby's knockback or Slene's spellspeed boost (so as not to waste it), currently that would require you to micromanage all your pets abilities instead of just the select few you want control over. \n \n Pet macros. We cannot include pet abilities in macros (at least i have not figured out how to do it after days trawling around various forums), this affects simple issues like placing sic at the front of your macros to ensure your pet hits the same target as you do, to the more complex like a mouseover embrace macro, it also stops us from creating a simple embrace macro since while the spells are exactly the same they are still considered different causing us to have to either have two hotkeys taken up by the different embraces or switch them every time we switch between eos and selene. \n \n Pet hotbar, we cannot modify the pet hotbar, being able to do so would be a nice change, however since pets don't have more skills that the hotbar allows this is understandable. \n \n AoE damage, pets (as far as I can tell) take as much aoe damage as players, while this is understandable, a aoe damage reduction for pets would be nice, but this might not be ideal for certain fights. For now it seems like the thm instant cast ability is a must to resummon pets in combat. \n EDIT: From the comments it seems like there is indeed a AoE damage reduction, but that this does not seem to work on all skills. \n \n Issuing pet orders/pet agressiveness while mounted. This is more of a quality of life change, simply being able to make pets non-agressive/defensive while mounted. The way it is now, unless you set your pet to steady (unsure of the name, but the passive setting), it will start attacking any monsters that attack you until it gets far enough back to despawn. So being able to have them not attack while mounted or to teleport to you after you reach a certain distance while mounted would be handy. \n \n \n Not just related to archanists/pets: \n \n Macro tooltips, range indicators and timers. The ability to add tootips to macros would be handy, but the real detrement (at least to me) to using macros is you lose the spells natural range indication (mana cost turns from white to red) and the cooldown timer. This means that if you want to create something like a virus macro you will have to either keep a mental note of the time (inaccurate), have a /echo prompt (unsure if these get cancelled by casting other spells), or have the non-macro virus somewhere on your hotbars. This could be easily rectified simply by adding something akin to #showtooltip. \n \n Interaction while mounted. Simply the ability to purchase items/hand in quests/check mail etc while mounted. \n \n \n Now apart from these (admittedly fairly small) issues, FFXIV is the most fun mmo I have played since WoW:BC, and I can definitely see myself spending a great ammount of time in Eorzea.": "ffxiv",

            "Looking for a bit of advice - I'm currently levelling a human priest and have specced Shadow for questing & Holy for healing in dungeons (to get that quick queue in the DF) \n But I've noticed a distinct drawback to levelling as shadow. Firstly, I seem to be constantly running low on mana. My current (level 42) rotation is: Devouring Plague, Mind Flay, Mind Blast then Shadow Word:Death once in killable range. I'm getting about 3 mobs down before mana becomes an issue. In dungeons, with no AOE, I seem to be out of mana all the time. \n Looking at the spell list and talent tree, it looks like a lot of signature abilities and that all important AOE aren't available till mid-Outland or later. The rotation, as it is, seems a bit limited, considering the amount of Holy dps spells I'm locked out of. Plus, the shadow orbs doesn't proc nearly as much as (I assume) it does at 85. \n Would I be better going discipline for the added viability of Holy DPS spells as well until Shadow becomes a bit more varied?

            "they release their new content as paid expansions. (WoW and Rift) \n I'm sorry, but speaking for WoW (don't know about Rift), you couldn't be more wrong. WoW has released huge amounts of content on a regular basis - virtually every point release includes a new dungeon, or expansion of existing content (Darkmoon faire for example). Some of this free content would virtually be an expansion pack for any other game. \n >when they realize they aren't going to be as successful they become mediocre, reduce their servers, add in a cash shop, and become free to play. \n Not sure how they become mediocre simply because they can't beat WoW. These days, most MMOs realise it simply isn't going to happen. Inertia in the MMO gaming world is a powerful force. There's an entire generation of MMO players who don't know a world before WoW. If they still have friends/guildmates playing the game, or if they have multiple max level characters, it is extremely difficult for them to leave all that behind on the promise of a \"better\" game experience elsewhere. Just about every major MMO release since WoW (LOTR, Conan, Warhammer, TOR, etc, etc) has seen people trying it, then returning to the safety of what they know. \n Additionally, changing from a subscription to a microtransaction model can be a good thing. Both LOTR and D&DO had a significant boost in player numbers when they went F2P. Anecdotally speaking, I've seen a lot of TOR players return to the game since it went freemium. GW and GW2 thrive, and indeed, market themselves as non-subscription as opposed to WoW. \n > This is where I'm able to use Star Wars Galaxies. Just about every thing was player driven \n I fondly remember my days play SWG and agree that player-driven content should be more of a concern when MMOs are developed. For those who didn't play it, most of the best equipment in the game was made by other characters, rather than being looted or quest rewards. Players would harvest raw materials (a time-consuming process), then sell those, or process them for their particular profession. \n This lead to an expansive and competitive economy- players could use a global vendor, or build their own vendor outlets. The best traders would be known server-wide and commanded huge respect (and prices) from their customers. \n > This was a level of great immersion created by the PLAYERS, not the developers. \n The developers have to put that framework in place. Going back to SWG, the devs would often bring major NPCs into the server. For example, Darth Vader would fly in and inspect an Empire outpost - all the players would be there in their best armour, lining up for inspection. \n Or guilds would arrange for a battle royale around an objective - alliances would be formed (and broken), spies would try to capture enemy intel, then the actual event would bring the server to its knees as hundreds of players would swarm on the location and the game couldn't cope. Sadly SWG's severs were famously fragile... \n But player driven content thrives despite the lack of framework for it. Before organised PvP in WoW, there was the Tarren Mill zerg, the Booty Bay Bumrush (a particular favourite on our server), the never-ending battle for Hemet Nesingwary's camp, or just storming the capital cities to kill their leader. RP realms have had the sort of events and organisation that you talk of - and this is with no real input or help from the devs. It is up to the players to engage in  player driven events , not the devs to force them into it. I can't speak for other MMOs, but I'm sure there's examples of player immersion outside the confines of how the game was initially designed. Certainly EVE Online is heavily based around player driven intrigues.": "Games",
            "Coming from someone who's been in the same situation - you've not done anything wrong at all and you shouldn't feel bad for it. \n Like you, my main in Vanilla was a mage whose DPS was pretty fearsome. In a competitive raiding guild, I was always at the top of the charts. But when BC came out and the chance to play a Horde pally came, I jumped at it, even though it meant losing the DPS from my mage. Sadly, our GL decided to gear up a pally himself, forcing me to return somewhat reluctantly to my mage. The same thing happened again when I had a druid that was brilliant at DPS in WoTLK - even though I wanted to be resto, I was forced to be moonkin in order to progress the guild. \n The question you need to ask yourself is where does your enjoyment lie? As much as being a GL or raid tank feels like it, WoW isn't a job, it's a game. You owe it to yourself to spend your leisure time doing what you want. Is that a little selfish? Maybe, but no one else stepped up when the guild was in need before - perhaps they should think about making sacrifices themselves before assuming that you should for their benefit. \n One other thing to note - things are going to change in a couple months. Whenever a new expansion comes out, there's always a scramble as people choose new mains based on what cool abilities they're getting. Add in a whole new race that can dps, tank and heal and you're going to have a completely different roster by the time you're ready for the first MoP raid. \n What you could do is sit down with your guildies and sketch out what people want to do, class-wise and role-wise in the expansion. Perhaps someone wants to be a Monk tank, or the other mage now wants to be a druid healer? Plotting it out makes people commit (at least a little) and gives you an idea of where you stand. \n The part where you mention that you've received texts is interesting - it indicates that you're more than just a group of people who play together. That sort of closeness forms a bond of trust, especially in smaller raiding groups, that can be easily broken. Hopefully, you can consider them friendly enough to respect your decision, even if they don't agree with it. The important thing is - communicate with the guild. Reassure them that you're not going anywhere and explain your reasons for a role change. Some people will see it as you trying to get away from the guild - as long as that's not your ulterior motive, people should be OK with your decision.": "wow"

            "Ah, finally, a post relevant to me! \n So I picked up a Virus TI a few months ago and have been playing around with the supersaws in it for ages trying to get the right sound. Here's a Zhu - Faded remix I did. The saw patch(es) run throughout the entire song, usually filtered in some way, but they come out in their full glory at 2:09. \n The full saw patch uses a Virus TI high-frequency supersaw, and Serum to pad out the midrange. If anyone wants deets on how I built them, let me know. \n quick edit: the Virus wasn't really necessary to get this sound. You can totally do it with just Serum or any other synth with good unison and high waveform resolution. The Virus just made is easier because it has a dead-sexy built in supersaw mode \n Edit 2: Alrighty, I'll go over the basics of my supersaw strategy real quick. Keep in mind, even if you don't have the Virus, you can load Virus saw waveforms into Serum - there's a huge pack floating around Reddit somewhere with custom wavetables and it's sweet. \n For my high-frequency saw, I loaded in a hypersaw on Oscillator 1 (or just grab any saw and stack it ~12 times with Unison in your soft synth), detuned until I got some of the high fuzzy stuff, and a basic saw in Oscillator 2. I left the basic saw volume relatively low, it's just there to give some focus to the sound. I also added a decent amount of white noise - white noise is VERY useful in getting that huge, warm, fuzzy pad effect. In the Virus' FX rack, I compressed it, added a bit of reverb, and used a Doppler delay to give it a bigger stereo field, similar to Massive's 'size' effect or Serum's hyper/dimension effect. \n In an effects chain in the DAW, I distorted the crap out of it and HPF'd it around 3 kHz, then mixed a little back in with the original synth, to add texture. Also added light saturation to the whole thing. Finally, with EQ8, I cut it at 200 Hz, with another slight dip around 930, boost around 7kHz, and hi cut at 19 kHz. \n My body saw patch is a little simpler. It uses two custom waveforms from that Serum pack I was talking about - Adventure Kid 0019 and Virus_WT_007, no unison, LPF at about 10:00, with Hyper/Dimension, a little bit of distortion, and a bitcrusher added in the DAW effects chain. It's low and digital-sounding by itself, but it fills out the high saw nicely. \n I glued them both together with FabFilter Saturn, some EQ, and Ableton's compressor, and then ran the finished supersaw + the bass through LFO Tool and Glitch to get all the variations throughout the song. \n Hope that helps, feel free to ask questions, and thanks for the kind words!": "edmproduction",
            "I play both here, and you're basically right on the money. A few clarification points: \n One of the major differences, which you touched on but didn't fully explain, is that DotA build paths are usually active-based (ex: Blink Dagger, gives you no stats but a badass active), while LoL items are much more about gaining stat advantages (ex: Deathcap, pure stats). \n Secondly, another point that you touched on with reference to skillshots but didn't dig into, is that LoL is much more of a fighting game. Lots of champions have low-cost, spammable skillshot abilities that lead to lanes being akin to top-down Smash Bros (ex: Riven). Heavy emphasis on micro over macro. This also means that almost everyone has 'counterplay,' meaning no 5-second stuns or silences, and no abilities or items that hard-counter someone. With the right amount of skill, anyone can outplay anyone. \n Finally, you said wards are unlimited in LoL - not entirely true. Each player can have a maximum of 3 stealth and 1 vision ward on the map. \n But in conclusion, they're both awesome games and I feel like people who hate on either one get too caught up in the comparisons and don't realize that they're fundamentally different in a lot of ways. \n Edit:": "explainlikeimfive",

The issue is that it's about something COMPLETELY DIFFERENT than the book. What made the book legendary wasn't that it was a fun, dramatic action tale about a boy being trained to battle space aliens. It was a much deeper book than that. Ender's Game deals with a myriad of moral conundrums, hypothetical sociopolitical situations (A lot of people forget about the badassery with the Warsaw Pact, and what happens at the end of the book), responsibility, and social interaction in a really unique and interesting scenario (Adult-intelligence children with often child-level impulsiveness). \n The movie missed all of that. Sure, it was pretty, had some cool fight scenes, Harrison Ford was stoic and badass. But there were so many choices made that showed that the director, writers, SOMEONE down the line had no real appreciation for the heart of the story. \n For instance. One of the things that bothered me more than anything - and I know it's a small thing, but bear with me - was that Bonzo was SMALLER than Ender. This is huge in so many ways. It changes so many things about their interactions, their relationship, and this relationship is one of the defining points of Ender's character. Ender even calls attention to the fact that Bonzo is so much bigger than him in the book - he uses it as a power play, goading Bonzo into fighting him on his level. It's HUGE. The whole thing is a metaphor for Ender triumphing over enemies with insurmountable advantages. And they cast someone a decent, noticeable amount shorter than Asa? When it would have been SO easy to find a talented, suitable actor who was physically appropriate, OR used camera tricks to make him look bigger? \n Anyways.

The primary reason they are so cheap is strictly because they can't be shipped long distances and need to be sold locally. \n Hard shell lobsters can be shipped, and thus they are a victim of supply and demand.

            "Former insurance agent here, technically no longer licensed to give you advice, but also not currently after your money. This advice has the right idea, but I'd like to add to it, to help you tailor your insurance for your own needs. \n Liability:  This is actually the most important part of your insurance coverage, because it's the part of your insurance that is going to protect your from the largest indemnity (aka if you get sued for a lot of money). Robin-Bunny said $2-3million, that may or may not be correct for your situation. The bottom line is your liability coverage should be roughly equal to your net worth, or the maximum amount you may be sued for in an auto accident, whichever is larger. If your net worth is $2-3million dollars then an umbrella policy for $2-3million dollars is definitely recommended. If you're a more average person and don't have a million dollar net worth I would still recommend as much liability coverage as you can easily afford. Hopefully you are never at fault in a major accident that involves injury or death, but if you are six figure settlements are likely, and million dollar settlements are becoming increasingly more common. When I was going through agent training they said something like 5% of all major accidents resulting in death lead to million dollar settlements in 1990, and in 2010 something like 30% of major injury/death settlements were over $1million. This is the one major thing your insurance needs to protect you against. The difference between state minimum coverage and a $1million umbrella is probably like $100-200 more per month and you're protecting yourself in the event you ever have a $1million lawsuit against you. \n Another really good piece of advice I was given in regards to liability insurance is that you are essentially also buying your insurance companies lawyers. if you have $50k coverage and there is a major accident, they're just going to pay out their $50k maximum responsibility and wash their hands of your problems. If you have $1million coverage their lawyers are going to fight for you because they're protecting their assets as well as yours at that point. \n Collision/Comprehensive:  Your collision and comprehensive coverage on the other hand should be the maximum amount you are able to pay out of pocket if you had an accident today. The average person will get into 1 car accident every 12 years. That's one of the basic statistics the insurance company is using to make money. The amount you're paying for collision specifically is figuring they will make more off you in 12 years than they will pay out when you have your 1 accident. What you need to do is set your deductable to the maximum amount you could afford if you had an accident today. That may be $500, maybe it's $1000, or $2000, some insurance companies even offer $5000 deductibles, and if you can afford that number that's what you should pick. the higher your deductible the less the scales are tipped in favor of the insurance company when you do have your one accident per 12 years, especially if you've been saving the money you have been saving on insurance premiums all along. It's ok to start out with a low deductible and work your way up too. start a self insurance savings account. Start by upping your deductible to $1000 if you're at $500 now. and set aside the $20/mo you'll save on premiums. in 2 years you'll have about $500 saved up, so if you have an accident you'll have a $1000 deductible, and $500 in cash you've saved in premiums anyways in 2 years. so you're still only out $500. if you don't have an accident up your deductible to $2000, now you're saving about $30 per month from where you started. in another 2-3 years if you have an accident you'll have close to $1500 saved, after your $2000 deductible you're still out $500 if you have an accident. following this strategy you'll build a self insurance 'nest egg' over time.

            "how really i can know how fast is car by knowing only horsepower? \n The simple answer is that you can't. \n Horsepower is a way to measure power, like a watt.  Power is how much work you can get done in a certain amount of time (sometimes it is used as amount of energy used in a period of time, but bear with me).  Work is basically anything useful.  When you pick up a box you are doing work.  When you plug a light bulb in and turn it on, the electricity is doing work to light the bulb up.  When you crank up your stereo system the electricity is making the speaker cone vibrate and do work to produce sound. \n In the context of cars, work is done to make your car move.  It has several parts, if you will.  For one thing, you have to get a big hunk of metal moving, and that takes work.  This is called overcoming inertia, or the property that makes your big hunk of metal not want to move, or keep moving once you have gotten it moving. \n Another is wind resistance.  Once you have gotten to a speed you want to go, you have a bunch of wind pushing against the car slowing it back down again. \n Another is friction.  All those parts inside your car that are moving against each other have friction that is trying to slow them down, and you have to do work to overcome that. \n Each of these aspects has a number of real factors that influence how much work they take to deal with.  For example, inertia is basically the weight of the car, so a heavier car will require more work to get moving.  How aerodynamic the car is will affect wind resistance, meaning different cars will be able to overcome that with more or less amounts of work.  And inside your car your engine can be designed to run more or less efficiently depending on several factors that can vary how much work it takes to run. \n So when someone tells you how much power it has, you know that it can do a certain amount of work in a certain amount of time.  But how does that relate to the cars specs?  If you don't know how heavy the car is, you can't know how much work it will take to accelerate it.  If you can't quantify how aerodynamic it is, you won't how much work it takes to get over wind resistance. \n Furthermore, the cars engine and drivetrain (the part that connects the engine to the wheels) can be set up differently to change how the power is applied.  Using gears in the transmission, more power can be applied at different speeds, to get certain effects.  And the total power an engine can't put out isn't what it always puts out, only at peak conditions and engine speeds, so depending on how you drive you may never see all that power.": "explainlikeimfive",

            "So you're saying that if OSU's defense plays up to it's full absolute 100% potential - literally perfectly - it's better than MSU's? Sure. \n Absolutely. Doesn't mean it's gonna happen. In fact, I guarantee you it won't happen.  (Ninja edit: I didn't say they would be better--I said they were a wash. E.g. \"OSU's ceiling on defense is Michigan State's defense.\" Almost caught you putting words in my mouth) \n OSU's defense is full of future draft picks too. Shazier and Roby are slotted for the first round. I would hazard to guess Barnett will find a team as well. I'm not sure what Grant's draft status will be after this year (he's a junior, I think).  OSU's entire defensive line is returning next year (including I think all of the backups). Bosa, the son and nephew of NFL D-linemen, is playing like a first round draft pick; Spence is not far behind.  But now we're counting chickens before they hatch--not a very good argument on either of our parts. \n You're confusing \"talent\" with \"execution.\" The difference between OSU's defense and MSU's defense is coaching. Great coaching, which MSU has, will overcome talent deficiency. Talent is worthless if it's not corralled into good form and execution. You can tell by watching some of the Buckeye games that there's a ton of miscommunication, poor tackling form, and lapses--mistakes that have  nothing  to do with talent and everything to do with coaching. This was evident late in the season against Illinois and Michigan; you could see them closer to their potential when they shut down a very good Indiana offense until late in the 4th quarter. \n I have no doubt in my mind that MSU has NFL talent; they just don't have as much as OSU. I doubt you'll find anyone without a horse in this race to agree otherwise.": "CFB",
            "There's not a whole lot you can do. At the end of the day, she's his girlfriend--he's with her by choice. Sometimes we're blind to the storm when we're right in the middle of the eye. \n Personal anecdote: one of my closest friends has this wife. I didn't really like her from the start, mostly because she acted like a pedantic know-it-all when in fact she usually had her facts wrong. She was a chronic contrarian. When he asked me to help him move her mom out of her apartment, I hated her even more. Because I got to see her mom and where she came from. Her mom was being evicted for the 2nd time (foreclosed the first). She took out credit cards and never paid them back; never paid bills, and extorted her ex husband for money. She had papers and trash everywhere, so she lived like a piggy. She was overweight and slothful. She didn't even have anything packed when we showed up. Instead of helping out, she dictated what had to be done and stood by. Then she left for hours. Then came back and dictated some more. No beer or even water for us. Cunt. \n Anyway, her daughter was exactly the same. One day, my buddy had it with her. He drove to her house and broke up with her. When he was leaving, she walked out of the house and stood in the yard and watched him the whole time. He got in his car, took a look back at her standing there in her nightgown and...changed his mind. When he took her back in that day, she knew. She  knew  that she won and she had him and could get away with anything now. \n He ended up buying a house and she moved in with her three cats and her pug. She proceeded to buy two chihuahuas. Their house instantly became a pig sty. He explicitly told her no more animals. But while he was at work one day she was out shopping with her mom and they came across the most adorable poodle ever, so she bought it. It turned into the most annoying fucking dog I've ever encountered. Seriously completely undisciplined. I want it to run outside and never return. Fucking ball-stomping brillo-haired cunt. I was describing the dog, by the way. \n She worked at a bank, and of course as in real life, she couldn't get along with anyone there. She insisted her coworkers were fucking with her, conspiring to fuck her over and whatnot. She  asked  (this is the key here, putting the onus on him) if she could stop working. He said it was okay with him. So now she's a stay at home wife (odd, because she acts like a hardcore feminist). \n It all came to a head several years ago. We were all out at a restaurant eating pizza and pounding pitchers. She and I got in an argument over some shit I don't even remember anymore. I ended going home and getting on AIM and telling him that his girlfriend is a bitch and a know-it-all who doesn't actually know anything, and that she's taking advantage of him, and that I don't want to be around her at all anymore. Naturally, this angered him. We even stopped hanging out for weeks. But slowly, we started hanging out again, he and I mostly, and months later it's like that conversation never happened. \n So what does it mean? For starters, the fact that we're still friends itself is a confirmation that he knows I was right. He's even acknowledged it. But this is still what he wants. He was never a social guy, and the very process of meeting people is taxing to him. He has a woman who is at least somewhat devoted to him; she has a provider and it works out for both of them. He ended up marrying her and now they have a kid. Their kid is his world. I choose not to go over to his house anymore. Not just because of his wife but because I'm allergic to their 7 pets. But we hang out all the time, and our friendship is stable. I'll take it. But I don't want anything to do with his wife, and he's come to terms with that as well.": "AskMen",

For starters, early attempts at irrigation were not perfect: the early extensive irrigation projects caused the salinity of the soil to increase, contributing to infertility of the soil and desertification of the land. This wasn't just attributed to humans, but over time, the climate changed somewhat, contributing to the decline in fertility of the soil. When civilization was just beginning, it was coming at the waning days of the last Ice Age, when the glaciers were rapidly retreating, contributing to rapidly changing climate patters.

            "I'm going to repost an explanation I did in /r/linguistics a while back. \n \n The first time I read about ergative languages it didn't click - it just seemed like a random way to do things. I'm going to explain it the way that made it finally make sense for me. This is a little different than how it's usually described, but the usual descriptions didn't work great for me. Maybe it will help you? \n (If not, I can also give you the standard rundown in ELI5 language.) \n Imagine that you're creating a language. You have the words, but no grammar yet. Now you start thinking about what kind of grammar you need. You start small, with the question: How will my language distinguish between subjects and objects from each other? \n You're familiar with grammatical roles like  subject  and  object  because you speak English, and English treats these grammatical roles differently: \n She sleeps.     (subject = she)\nShe hugged her. (subject = she; object = her)\n \n English also puts the subject before the verb and the object right after the verb. But examine those sentences again. There are actually two kinds of subjects there. In \"she sleeps,\" the verb is  intransitive , meaning that there's no direct object. In \"she hugged her,\" the verb is  transitive , meaning that there is a direct object. You can make the list of grammatical roles more detailed: \n transitive subject\nintransitive subject\ndirect object\n \n Back to the language you're creating. You have a list of grammatical roles, but you don't want to assume that your language will work just the same way as English. You want to explore the possibilities. You start by trying to translate a simple sentence like \"the dragon sleeps\" into your language. You reach into your bag of words and draw out: \n dragon, sleep\n \n Well, you don't need to distinguish between subject and object in this sentence because it's intransitive, and there is no object; \"dragon\" can only be the subject. So you try to translate a sentence that's slightly more complicated, \"George kills the dragon.\" You reach into your bag of words and draw out: \n george, dragon, kill\n \n Now you have a subject and object that need to be distinguished somehow. Is the dragon killing George, or is George killing the dragon? You decide you need a suffix to mark the difference between these two grammatical roles because you like suffixing languages. But which word will you attach the suffix to? You can attach it to the object, like this: \n george dragon-X kill \n\"George kills the dragon.\" \n \n You've just invented a nominative-accusative language. In both \"dragon sleep\" and \"george dragon-X kill,\" the subjects follow the same pattern, regardless of if they are transitive or intransitive subjects; it's the direct object that is marked differently. The subjects are in the nominative case, and the object is in the accusative case. \n That's not the only possibility, though. You  can  attach the suffix to the subject instead: \n george-Y dragon kill\n\"George kills the dragon.\"\n \n You've accomplished the same task you set for yourself - distinguishing subject and object. But now you've invented an ergative-absolutive language, instead of a nominative-accusative one. Intransitive subjects and objects are marked the same; it's transitive subjects that are marked differently. Intransitive subjects and objects are in the absolutive case, and transitive subjects are in the ergative case.": "conlangs",

            "If we assume that by sound you mean [phoneme]( then you can at least  consider  attempting to answer the question... \n ... but you're still going to run into some pitfalls. Since phonemes are  categories  of sounds, even if the prototyptical member is the same in two languages, other members may not be. English /p/ is not the same phoneme as Hindi /p/, because while in English /p/ contains both [p] and [p^h ], in Hindi those sounds are contrastive and therefore belong to separate phonemes. \n So, you would have to decide whether you would count English /p/ as one phoneme, then Hindi /p/ and /p^h / as two additional phonemes. This would be theoretically the most sound method,  but  it's probably not what you want. If you knew Hindi only, you would be able to easily distinguish [p] and [p^ h], so maybe you wouldn't need English /p/ at all. \n Depending on how you answered that question, you could easily add or remove thousands of languages to your list of languages you need to learn. Let's assume that it's the second one, though - that you want to learn all of the languages necessary so that you can hear/produce all attested contrasts. \n Some languages have unique or at least very unusual phonemes: Korean tense and lax obstruents have a distinction that is not found anywhere else; Czech has a [raised alveolar non-sonorant trill]( Toda has [all of this going on]( Swedish has [this]( fricative; Icelandic has phonemically voiceless nasals... I could keep going on. \n You would have to add the Khoisan languages, for their clicks; you would have to add Burmese for its vowel phonation types; you would have to add languages that contrast coarticulated stops; you would have to add languages that have implosives, languages that have voiced versus pre-voiced distinctions, languages that have phonemic length distinctions in vowels (like Hindi) and consonants (like Finnish), languages that contrast pre-glottalized, velarized, palatalized, ejective, etc etc cosonants ... I could continue going on but I think you get the picture. \n And  then,  once you had done  all that , you would have to decide whether you had to consider phonotactic constraints - by which I mean constraints on how sounds can be  arranged . For example, in English, we have a velar nasal, but only at the end of a syllable, so have trouble saying the initial consonant of a name like \"Nguyen.\" Would we have to learn a language like Vietnamese, which allows it at the beginning of a syllable? Likewise, with /h/ - we have that phoneme, but we have trouble pronouncing it at the end of a syllable. Some languages do have it. And for consonant clusters ... would we need to learn [Nux\u00e1lk]( so we could pronounce words like /x\u0142p\u0313x\u0323\u02b7\u0142t\u0142p\u0142\u0142sk\u02b7c\u0313/?": "linguistics",

If you don't, it will continue to be confusing and you will likely make foolish errors when attempting to use it. It will probably also cost you more effort in the long run. The IPA is systematic, and you should take advantage of that! \n Consonants \n The most common way to characterize a consonant is with three pieces of information, in this order: \n \n whether the consonant is voiced \n where in the mouth the consonant is articulated \n the manner that the consonant is articulated \n \n Most of the consonant symbols in the IPA can be arranged into a chart organized by this information. The horizontal axis is the place and the vertical axis is the manner. If there are two symbols in a cell, the left one is voiceless, and the right one is voiced. (If there is only one symbol in a cell voicing is not usually distinctive for that manner and place combination; you will have to look up whether the consonant is voiced.) \n Read these pages and you will be off to a good start with consonants: \n (Just the intro section to the voicing section is enough for now.) \n Vowels \n Vowels can also be arranged in a chart. Vowels don't need to be characterized by their manner of articulation, since their manner is (in simple terms) vowel. Instead, we need two pieces of information about the place of articulation: whether the tongue is front or back, and whether it is high or low. Front-back is the horizontal axis, and high-low is the vertical axis. When two vowels occupy the same space in the chart, the difference is lip rounding. \n Extras \n There are a few symbols that don't fit on the consonant or vowel chart. Some consonants have more than one place of articulation, for example. \n There are also symbols with which you can modify the main IPA symbols, for when you need additional levels of detail, or when you're dealing with a language that makes distinctions that the main symbols don't directly encode. \n I would just wait until after you learn the main IPA symbols to tackle these.

The problem is that it is almost impossible to define what it means to use language \"incorrectly\" that makes sense in a historical context. \n There is no objectively correct language.

It's always changing and as such there have always been people using it in a way that is new and different. \n Our attitudes--our  language ideologies --are always changing also. What kind of variations are considered \"incorrect\" depends on these ideologies. \n It used to be thought that modern English grammar had \"degenerated\" and that languages that had better preserved the complicated inflectional systems of their ancestors, like Latin, were superior. The entire language was \"incorrect\"--and although it couldn't much be helped, there were some efforts to make points of English grammar more Latin-like. \n Our current beliefs about the \"right\" and \"wrong\" ways to use language are no less culturally determined.

This is not just true for particular points of grammar (like the split infinitive), but also for attitudes towards types of variation in general. \n It doesn't make much sense to ask if people 500 years ago were using English \"incorrectly\" as often as we do now, when their ideas of what constituted \"incorrect\" language were different than ours. \n Just as an example, it has not always been the case that words had a single correct spelling; you will find all different kinds of spellings from writers highly educated in their day. You cannot ask if people have always had as much trouble using the correct spelling, when the notion of \"correct\" spelling has changed so much. \n Then you have to consider mass education and its impacts on our ideologies and expectations.

            "I know you've already gotten some good responses, but I'll try to give you a really simple one, and hopefully if there's anything still unclear at this point, it'll be cleared up. \n So first, let's talk about heat transfer from a hot temperature to a cold temperature.  This seems totally normal.  Cold things get hotter when they're in contact with hot things, and vice versa. \n Now say we have some sort of engine in the middle.  This engine consists of a cylinder filled with gas which has a piston that can move up and down.  If we add heat to the gas from the hot temperature, the gas expands, without changing temperature, and pushes the piston upwards. \n Then, without allowing  any  heat to escape the gas, pull the piston out further.  This causes the gas to expand even more, and lowers its temperature significantly. \n Then we expose the gas to some cold temperature.  This makes the gas lose heat to the cold temperature, and compresses the gas without changing its temperature. \n Finally, we push just a little bit more on the gas, which compresses it further, and makes it hotter.  We do this just right, such that it goes identically back to the very first state I described. \n What we find is that we actually get a net output of useful work from this cycle, just by heating the gas up and cooling it down!  Indeed, this is called a  Carnot cycle , the area in the curvy square thing on that graph (labeled \"w < 0\"). \n So that's all well and good.  Moving heat from hot to cold can put out work.  We all know this from things like driving cars and such.  So how does it relate to your question?  How can we possibly get heat to flow from cold to hot?! \n Well take that cycle I just described and put it into reverse.  If you start with the first state of the gas (labeled A on the chart), and move  backwards , something really interesting happens.  We take a (relatively) hot gas, expand it until it gets  colder than the cold temperature , let the \"cold\" surroundings heat up the \"really cold\" gas so that it becomes \"hot\", compress the gas some more so it becomes \"really hot\", transfer heat from the \"really hot\" gas to the \"hot\" surroundings, rinse, and repeat.  We've done something amazing here.  If we drew a big black box around the cylinder arrangement, and looked at how heat is flowing, it appears, by all accounts, that  heat is flowing backwards! \n Now of course, heat isn't  actually  flowing backwards.  That simply can't happen.  The key is that when you reverse a cycle, the work you got out of it before becomes the work you put into it.  It really comes at a cost.  But still!  It's wicked cool!

            "Hey folks. I'm really bored. Maybe this is a shitpost, or maybe you'll enjoy it. I like playing drums, and I like math, so let's see how long it would take me to play every possible drum beat. Just to clear up some assumptions: \n \n I'll play at a constant 90 BPM, all in 4/4 time. \n I'll play just one bar of each beat. \n For my sanity, I'm going to pretend triplets don't exist. Binary subdivision fits better with the mathematical theme anyway. \n I'll go up to 32nd note subdivisions but no higher. \n \n I will definitely apply some other assumptions, but I'll do so implicitly in order to prevent a gigantic list of bullets. \n Alright, now that that's out of the way, let's see how long I have to play. Let's start with everyone's favorite beat, the standard rock beat. Closed hats on all the quarter notes, kick on 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4. Great! One down, surely there can't be that many left. \n For the second one maybe I'll relax a little bit. I'll keep the quarter note ostinato on the closed hats, but I'll just have kick on 1 and snare on 3. Awesome, now we've got two. Let's keep going. Maybe now I'll go back to the first beat but I'll open the hats on 2 and 4. Easy enough, there's three! \n Ya know, on second thought maybe it'll take a while to describe these all in words. I could maybe write them on the staff and scan each one in to show you, but my scanner is conveniently broken so I'll have to think of something else... Hmm, maybe I could write these beats with some other sort of diagram more suited to Reddit's raw text input... Let's say that for every note the right hand, left hand, right foot, and left foot are either doing something or they're not. So if a '1' is 'doing something' and a '0' is 'doing nothing', maybe we could write our first beat like this: \n    1    2    3    4\nLH 0    1    0    1\nRH 1    1    1    1\nLF 1    1    1    1*\nRF 1    0    1    0\n \n * Note that I'm considering keeping the hats closed 'doing something'. \n Pretty awesome beat, right? Never felt myself wanting to groove more than I am now, looking at that diagram. Something's interesting about this though... I could rewrite this again so as not to have to worry about formatting a table for every beat. I could write it in a single line, something like this: \n > [LH RH LF RF] \n Or in the case of our super sick groove: \n > [0101111111111010] \n I'm headbanging just looking at it. This is fantastic though because this is a genuine, bona fide number, and in the past people have been much more satisfied with my work regarding numbers than my work behind the kit. Anyway, like I said this is a genuine number. We could say it's 101,111,111,111,010, but if you look  very carefully , you'll see that it's all ones and zeros, so maybe we should read it as a binary number. In fact, it's 24,570 in base 10. So after all, perhaps our first beat should've actually just been kick on 4, and nothing else, corresponding to [0000000000000001]. \n So we could count every beat between [0000000000000001] and [1111111111111111] to find out how many beats I have to play. \n \"But wait!\", you say, \"All of those beats were in quarter note subdivisions, so you've gotta play a lot more!\" Good catch. You're right. I thought a table 32 columns wide might be a little excessive. Fortunately, at this point we don't need to write anything that long, because math. All of the numbers corresponding to quarter note beats were 16 digits long (four limbs times four notes), so it follows that each beat of four limbs times 32 notes will have 128 digits. \n So how many beats do I  really  have to play? Luckily enough, binary numbers are easy to work with for this kind of thing, because the number corresponding to flailing all your limbs in unison 32 times (incredible groove, by the way, try it at your next gig), is exactly the number of total beats I have to play. That is, counting from [0000.......0001] to [1111.......1111] contains every number between the two, and every number corresponds to a unique beat up to 32nd note subidivisions. \n In other words, I have to play (in base 10) 2^128 beats. That's 340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456 beats. A fat guy has somewhere around a  million billion billion  fewer cells in his body than I have beats to play. Shit.

We all smoke cigarettes, and LAX (worst airport I've ever been to, btw) doesn't have any smoking areas within the airport itself, so if you wanted a cigarette you had to go outside, and then go back through security.  We had a really long layover, so we did this many times. \n At one point we were standing in the security line to get back in, and I turned to my friend and said, \"Hey Thomas... do you think any gay people say 'faggot' to each other the way black people sometimes say the N word to each other?\".

            "Nonononono! /u/Maxtorly has an uncareful answer that will lead you astray later on! The problem is the chemical reactions we use to define \"bond strength\" and acidity are very different. \n The \"strength\" of a bond is usually the \"homolytic bond dissociation energy\". For hydrogen gas, H2, this is the energy it takes to take a diatomic hydrogen molecule and by giving each partner one of the electrons from the bond, turn it into two hydrogen  atoms . For nonpolar bonds, this gives a good picture of the \"strength\" of the bond. \n For polar bonds, though, one of those partners already hogs more of those bonding electrons, so to do what we did before with H2 to a polar bond like in H2O, we not only have to overcome the energy of the \"bond strength\" but also have to pull those electrons away from electronegative oxygen and put them on the less electronegative hydrogen! That takes extra effort and so the \"homolytic bond dissociation energy\" of polar bonds tends to be higher. \n Of course if you want to leave both bonding electrons with the more electronegative partner, like O in our H2O example , you're already partway there since oxygen hogs the electron density in the O-H bond! That's why H2O has a pKa that is almost 20 units smaller than H2! \n Think about it like you have a pair of bowling balls in a shed in a valley. In a weaker, nonpolar bond you and your friend live on the top of hills on either side of the valley where you keep your balls. If you wanted to each take one home that's take some work, and if you wanted to take both home yourself it would be extra work for you. BUT in a polar bond you, the more electronegative atom Oxygen,, live on a small hill and your friend, the less electronegative Hydrogen, lives at the top of a mountain. If you wanted to each take one ball home it would take a mountain of work to get his ball up the hill and so we'd say your \"bond is strong\" and together you'd rather keep your balls where they are. But if you wanted to take both balls home with you and leave him in the lurch, that's easy since they're practically at your door already. So while your bond is strong it's also very polar and potentially acidic.": "chemhelp",

My parents had fancy cable television, I grew up on animated shows of all kinds (except, for some weird reason, my parents didn't let me watch The Simpsons though Far worse things were accessible). If I had to put my finger on it, I think Digimon was one of the first shows I went out of my way to watch (and I had the electronic pet toys as well). I didn't really know that I had watched \"anime\" until I met a really creepy, rabid otaku in middle school. He turned me off to anime for a while (by distasteful association a.k.a. he threatened to slit my wrists in history class if I fell asleep), but I eventually got back into it after a few pleasant chance encounters (Digimon, Ruroni Kenshin, Outlaw Star). \n In college I actually lived in the \"Japanese Culture\" (read: Nerd and Otaku) dorm and that cemented things.

            "Preface: my experience is somewhat limited and only in Japanese sword techniques (katana, battoujutsu mostly), but there are some interesting discrepancies that I would share: \n \n Real swords are much thinner than 1/4 inch, on average, unless they are very long. So your surrogate was probably a bit overweight. For katanas, they're rarely more than three pounds all-told. [Site for reference]( \n \n For many blades, actually cutting your target is much, much more dependent on your technique than on the force of your swing. If you strike at the right location along the blade, with the sword aligned with the arc of your swing, the blade does most of the work for you. You can swing as hard as you like and expend a whole lot more effort yet not cut clean through if your form is off. This is not the case for \"crude\" blades like the claymore, which is really not that sharp and whose main threat is being huge and hard to stop. \n \n Have you ever seen a samurai run? They don't run swinging their arms and letting their scabbard flop around; they do so with both hands at their hips to stabilize their weapons (generally a katana on the left and a tanto on the right).

It also has the advantage of being much, much quicker on the running draw.": "truegaming",
            "That, of course, depends highly on what you think of WoW itself. \n I got my MMORPG start in early Everquest, a game which is notorious for not making the player's life easy. You lost experience when you died, and could de-level from that loss (level 11 and above). When you died all your items remained on your corpse, which lay (often very inaccessibly) right where you breathed your last. Monsters of your level were generally too hard to fight alone (with some exceptions), making almost every endeavor require a party. Quests often didn't come with well-explained objectives, and certainly didn't tell you precisely where you'd find the drop in question. There were entire cities (heck, nearly whole continents) that contained NPCs who would probably try and kill you on sight. Monsters didn't have tethers to their spawns, and would chase you until you were dead, they were dead, or you left the zone. Factions weren't organized into neat Player-favored/Mob-favored dualities. (Doing quests for the wrong scum in Freeport might get you on the right side of some citizens at the expense of others.) \n But despite all that, it had  flavor . Your choices during character creation mattered, even if they could be worked around. (For example, if you chose to be a dark elf, worshiping Inorruk, you would find few friends among the good races, and even be distrusted or attacked by the followers of Cazic Thule among the other evil races. These differences faded as new expansions created more and more \"neutral\" territory like the Plane of Knowledge.) \n The game was a challenge. I spent nearly all of my time in Everquest leveling to the cap; I enjoyed finding a new place to adventure every few levels. And it wasn't just about new scenery, but often  mastering  a new zone, its layout, its monsters, and its other hazards. Heck, I remember watching groups a few levels higher than the mobs in the Crushbone throne room getting run out of the castle because they were uncoordinated. \n And since the only way to cope with the difficulties of the game was to work with others, they were amazing ways to strike up a new friendship. (I remember my first necromancer fondly, as I made many friends by helping people recover their corpses than by casual grouping.) \n I found none of these things in WoW. The game was handed to me with a roadmap. Quest-marked NPCs led me from one zone of appropriate level to the next. I leveled my first character, a Troll Mage, to 60 almost completely solo. Sure, I ran some instances when my friends were around, but I never  needed  someone's help. When I got assistance from a higher-level player, it was only to accomplish something that I should not have been able to do myself (like run an instance at a level much lower than the average monster level). \n Then I hit 60 and the game changed, for the worse. Suddenly, this game which allowed one to reach the level cap almost completely alone, had no more content for such a player. Now I needed a guild, had to spend many hours doing the same dungeons hoping for a drop that would give me 5 more Intellect. I could walk pretty much anywhere with impunity, since monsters who were dumb enough to aggro would disengage after a set distance. \n As the updates came out and expansions were released, this problem only got worse. It mattered less and less what class you chose (let's not get into race...), since you could re-spec at will. Except at the highest level of raiding, you could throw a party together with almost anyone; though these changes helped the solo player play with others, it cheapened the  character  you played, rendering it ever more and more simply an avatar whose role was simply functional.": "truegaming",
            "If you are truly an INTJ, I am sorry that I have only my experience to share, though I hope it's helpful: \n Look, I sometimes feel this way during attempts at introspection, but have over the course of years come to accept it as part of who I am. \n Why? Because I have always felt that I don't have enough information to make an unbiased assessment of myself. There are patterns that emerge, but they're not conclusive and are riddled with cognitive bias -- in almost every case where an internal choice needed to be made, I could not say with confidence that I was more apt for one over the other. This has been excruciatingly paralyzing at times when such a decision looms large over my life, at one point so much so to contemplate the unthinkable. \n But you know what? I've accepted that. I know that, while I may be able to understand things on an intuitive level, without being able to share them externally I cannot overcome my own internal biases. Despite my uncertainty and an avalanche of \"what if\"s and speculative alternative realities I haven't truly regretted any of those decisions that weren't completely clear-cut, only those in which no decision was made at all! For those that I was comfortable sharing, the very act of expressing my extroverted thinking helped clarify the matters at hand and for those matters I am unwilling to share, I have become prepared to accept a certain degree of uncertainty. \n As a recent example, I recently decided to go to graduate school and brooded over the choice for weeks before realizing that I could not make that decision in a vacuum. The pros and cons that I felt comfortable expressing to others readily fell in line, and those that I could not remained somewhat uncertain. But that is the nature of my mental landscape, and I made a choice based on a combination of more and less certain factors. Was it a sure thing? Not by a long shot. Does it feel, at times, like I'm \"conforming\" to external expectations? Sure it does. But without expressing my thoughts externally, I as an INTJ can seldom come to a firm conclusion, and that is inevitably going to be biased by my internal and external dialogue.": "intj"

            "This is especially noticeable in California... Our prisons were so overcrowded ( 200% capacity  that some penitentiaries went from double to triple occupancy in each cell. Then the state realized it was way too dangerous/cost-ineffective and they were in over their heads when, say, one cell block has 4 officers to patrol an area that houses hundreds of inmates. The next step was to shift responsibility for the \"low lying fruit\" crimes you mentioned to county jails instead of continuing to shove those \"serious\" offenses into the bottleneck resulting from tons of new prisoners coming in and few going out. That has made it so that you can expect to serve half of your sentence, maximum, usually. Oh and the Supreme Court also ordered the [release of 40k+]( inmates in 2 years' time when it was determined that it'd be easier to just downsize the population in one foul swoop... \n I'm the first to admit that the penal system in CA is way too harsh on \"low lying fruit\" offenses, there's absolutely no reason why someone with a weed sack in their car or a probation violation for an unpaid ticket should be serving out a sentence next to violent offenders, oftentimes for comparable lengths once plea bargains, rehabilitation programs, good behavior, etc. are accounted for. But it makes it hard not to feel like there are now very few people who are actually arrested, charged, convicted, and forced to serve out the sentence deemed fair in court.

            "I don't think I've ever been so torn in my life. Here's the scenario, if you need more information feel free to ask me. \n My husband and I have been using h for approx. a year (only smoking, neither of us has ever tried IV). We had intermittently used various pills for several years before that, but not on a regular basis. For the first half of this year, we were probably using between a half gram and a gram of black per day, an amount we were concerned about and, frankly, ashamed of. It had escalated quickly as is often the case when sales come into the picture. Fast forward a few months, selling is no longer involved because of the huge negative impact it had on our life (not only usage-wise, but because of the incessant calls from buyers, stress resulting from money problems, constant fear of getting caught up, etc) and we did a pretty good job of reducing our daily usage, perhaps to a .4/.5 each per day. For the last month we've been diligently tapering off in an effort to finally kick the habit completely; we can't afford it at all now that the sales days are long behind us and as newlyweds we cannot justify pouring our paychecks into drugs when we have responsibilities to attend to. I feel like we're getting our life back and we've reduced our usage to a meager .2 maximum each day and any w/d symptoms are much more tolerable than before. \n That brings me to this afternoon, when a whole new issue just presented itself unexpectedly. I woke up this morning thinking we were doing great, just a couple more days from our target, when someone suggested to my husband that the best way to wean ourselves off the last little amount (essentially, to maintain the very low usage level and allow our bodies to re-regulate while using/buying very minor amounts) would be to shoot it up. The argument, I guess, is that we could split a half gram over several days if injected, whereas smoking it requires more -- and our finances just don't have any room for more at this point. \n If I'm being honest with myself, I am terrified by the thought of even going there. We've made it this far without giving in to any offers to try IV. That step is where many of our friends dove head first into a deeper problem than they had before, which sounds terrible to me when we've worked this hard to taper ourselves off with nothing but diligence and hard work. So, my questions: has anyone else received this as a suggestion for tapering off, or is this person misinformed and further passing along that misinformation to us? Would this be a good idea or a terrible one? \n The last issue is that my husband prefaced the pitch with, \"The reason why I'm entertaining this thought is because it's something I've always wondered about, even before we ever got involved in the first place. If we quit this weekend without ever trying it I almost feel as though I'll think like  *  [friend who went through a similar situation, tried to quit suddenly without a plan or \"getting in his kicks\" for lack of a better term] did and relapse because I didn't get it out of my system.\" To me that sounds like it could be his mind trying to justify a questionable solution to a serious problem that we've spent months trying to remedy. But at the same time, if it's really something he wants to try, I do recognize that this is the absolute last time it will ever be an option. I am not as well educated about the effects of different usage methods (bio-availability and whatnot) like my husband is, and he seems to think this is a good recommendation, so I wanted to ask you all what you think: would it be worth it to try this as a way to wean ourselves off that last little bit we've been using or are we asking to set ourselves back? Or, if the tapering thing is a total no-go, would it be worthwhile to try to shoot up one time to quell any curiosity about it and then get back on our quitting schedule that's worked well for us thus far? \n Sorry this is so long, I apologize for ranting -- this is just a very sudden and thought-consuming predicament. Any and all advice is much appreciated! I can take the heat, give it to me if you've got it. Thanks all.": "opiates",

And they're blue...? And red! Now I'm fully panicking and try to wake up my outrageously heavy sleeper of a boyfriend. He won't budge. I start frantically shaking him, \"BABE, THE COPS!

First of all, we were asleep. Plus, \"Excuse me, I'm on the pill and we haven't had sex since yesterday!\" probably wouldn't fly. Apparently, they'd mentioned to Boyfriend's dad that they found my underwear in the car, but no condoms. Next comes repeated rants about unprotected sex, unprotected sex, unprotected sex in front of my mom, Boyfriend's parents, and best friends' moms. I made the trip to Planned Parenthood, thank you very much, we don't have unprotected sex! \n It's clear that our parents are absolutely devastated. We had been dating for 3 years already, so I was caught off guard by this reaction but alas... extreme disappointment and anger.

Why would you have sex at this age, don't you know better than that? What would happen to your hopes and dreams if you were to get pregnant?

            "I won't even use pads anymore unless I have to. I feel disgusting and concerned that they'll leak and I'll ruin my clothes, embarrass myself in front of a bunch of people, or both. Tampons aren't less gross in actuality, but going about my day when I'm on my period just  feels  less nasty and distracting with tampons. I notice the pad constantly if I do have to go that route (say, if my period comes unexpectedly and I have to ask a stranger in a mall bathroom for a handout... at that point you'll take anything you can get) whereas tampons aren't noticeable at all. Pads are exactly as gross as you'd imagine: you're sticking a large yet relatively thin strip of cotton (with a sticky backing that manages to stick with a vengeance to your skin, hair, etc. but slips off the surface it's meant for) in your underwear to catch blood that's leaking out of you without any semblance of regularity. It's not a constant, regulatable flow, it comes in bursts that vary in volume, frequency, and consistency. Plus the beginning of your cycle is different than the middle of it which is different than the end of it, so you can't really just say \"I'll change my pad every  __  hours\" because it's constantly fluctuating and catching you off guard. \n It's not normal blood like you'd see if you cut yourself either... As OP explained, it's gloppy, dark, and generally unpleasant for anywhere from 3-7 (and upwards, if it's really bad!) days. Underwear, even with the proper precautions taken, is bound to take a hit every so often and it sucks to throw out cute panties that don't come clean. Tampons have a maximum capacity too, of course, but I'd rather put in a new tampon every few hours (I find it easier to tell how much I'm bleeding with tampons, also -- pads always just seem like a gross mess and it's harder to judge the changes as they're happening) rather than anxiously worrying about if my pad is overflowing or finding out the hard way that it already has. Or the other side of the coin is fretting about needing to change it, only to find that you're really just sweaty or uncomfortable from the rubbing and now you've wasted one of the many trips to the bathroom you have to add to your schedule for as long as your period lasts. There's another conniving little aspect of periods called \"spotting\" which would trick me when I first started getting my period into thinking it was over before it really was, so I'd stop wearing pads only to discover that it wasn't over at all. I get way more peace of mind just wearing a tampon and changing it less frequently as the spotting dissipates over the last few days. Another consideration is that pads are not easily transportable/concealable. Imagine taking a [small clutch]( into a club or on a nice date and trying to cram multiple pads in there with your ID, credit cards, cash, keys, etc. It's also just a matter of convenience/practicality. \n Okay I've definitely rambled enough about periods now!": "explainlikeIAmA"

These would be actual \"Chinese conversations.\" \n >It was often not really clear what you were supposed to notice in the pictures as they were reshuffled for different vocab and the whole idea of learning from association that Rosetta Stone pushes so much seemed moot \n I don't know about the library or the provenance of your copy. In pirated copies it's intentionally shuffled. I can assure you in Version 4 it's very, very clear. \n >It didn't do anything to teach you how to read and write in Chinese - despite the whole \"we are doing things the natural way\" learning how to read and write in a different writing system is not a natural process, it's something you are taught in school and for children it usually takes at least a year to learn (many more for Chinese children) \n Version 2 sucks at reading and writing, Versions 3 and 4 are great for reading, and good for  typing , which is how I do most of my writing in Chinese, but they still suck at anything as far as writing by hand. During my tenure with RS I was the thorn in R&D's side because I kept pushing writing pedagogy, since written Chinese is nowhere near as hard as everyone keeps pretending it is. \n >While it deliberately forgoes grammar instruction, it also doesn't teach you real pronunciation. \n Both of these are not true for versions 3 and 4. First, not only does it teach increasingly complex grammar, but it breaks it apart and freakin'  color-codes  it in screens labeled  Grammar.  As for pronunciation, there is in-house voice recognition, including a full [spectrogram]( of your voice. There's also an 'alphabet' screen that teaches pinyin and pronunciation. Part of why I  love  RS is that people who use it tend to have much, much better pronunciation than people who don't. \n >It had a crappy nineties'ish edutainment interface \n Definitely not the current versions. Also, not actually relevant to language learning, but I understand the concern. \n >Basically, the whole premise that children learn languages endogenously purely from their own observation is false. \n AND IRRELEVANT. You're arguing with marketing, not with the actual linguistic science behind the method. It's a lot easier to say \"learn like a child,\" than it is to get people to buy something advertised as \"Learn language through a context-based immersion environment predicated on a usage-based model of L2 acquisition with required use of spectrogram analysis and spaced repetition, complimented by (unlimited) sessions of unscripted conversation with native speakers through a proprietary interface.\" \n The child thing is a red herring. I don't argue that children aren't idiots. You're smart enough to recognize that learning like a child is BS, so it's surprising to see that it's just  marketing  eluded you. \n Your": "ChineseLanguage",

            "I always am asked questions regarding to Iran, Iran's political affiliations, and why the Iranian government is seen as so harsh, and oppressive. Im going to try to explain the reasons why this is through historical events. Hopefully you will understand towards the end why I believe that it would be natural for the the Iranian government to have so much animosity towards the US and the world. I am in no way taking sides for any party. I am just attempting to rationalize a topic that most people would see as irrational unless otherwise explained. \n 1935 - End of Dynasty regime in Persia, Pahlavi Monarchy begins. This was the huge change in middle eastern history because Persian officially changed its name to Iran (which translates to land of the Aryans). \n 1953 (Considered the First Iranian Revolution) - Prime Minister Mossadegh, after gathering many years of attention and support from the Iranian people rises as the new voice and visionary of Iran overpowering the Shah of Iran. The Iranian people are unhappy with the vast amount of unemployment and poverty. Mossadegh is seen as a national hero. \n The United States sees this shift in power as a great threat to its power in the middle east. One of Mossadeghs greatest platforms for reform was the nationalization of Oil, dramatically cutting exportation to return the resources and profit to the Iranian people. The US wanting continuous control of the oil plots a Coup d'\u00e9tat against Mossadegh returning power back to the monarchy. Mossadegh was tried and sentenced to three years of solitary confinement and then was under house arrest until his death in 1967. The US regained power again in the middle east and retained one of its largest suppliers of oil. The Iranian people are once again oppressed. \n 1953-1979 - Iranians are growing deeper into poverty and unemployment. Overall morale as a country is decreasing and the people are growing increasingly hostile against the monarchy citing corruption and money laundering. The Shah implements the SAVAK (secret police) whom are ordered to kill the political opposition and those who oppose the current regime. With a estimated total of 60,000 members at its peak it was the most powerful political organization in Iran at the time, now only overshadowed by the modern day basiji which has been estimated to have around 80,000 members. \n During this time the people begin an uprising against the Shah, Ayatollah Khomeini is hailed as their leader and in April of 1979 returns to Iran from his exile in France. The Second Iranian AKA Islamic revolution occurs, the Shah, who was a great supporter of the USA, is exiled and never returns to Iran, leaving with only his immediate belongings and two suitcases full of Iranian soil. \n 1979 - Iranian students take over the American Embassy in Tehran Capturing more than 50 hostages. The majority of them stay for 444 days. No Americans were killed. Carters reelection is deemed impossible and his term was forever blemished by this event. Regan eventually was able to regain the hostages during his term. \n 1980-1988 - Following popular revolution against the US backed dictator, Iran is invaded by neighboring Iraq. The US supported the aggressor in the war that cost Iran over a million lives. Children as young as 14 were sent off to defend Iran. Iran had NO allies during this war. The United States gave Iraq technology and weapons (Sarin Gas) that Saddam Hussein used against the Iranians and more famously against the kurds. Donald Rumsfeld went to Iraq and shook Saddam Husseins hand after making giving him arms. \n After 8 years a ceasefire is agreed to. There are no winners. Iran fought nearly a decade against the entire world. No explanations are given by the US or the rest of the world for their actions, the dead speak for themselves. \n 1988- USS ship shoots down a commercial flight operated by Iran Air. refuse to apologize.Medals given to the shooters. George H. W. Bush declared, \"I will never apologize for the United States of America \u2014 I don't care what the facts are\" in reference to the incident. The closest thing to an apology Iran receives are numerous statements of how \"unfortunate the situation is\". More than 250 Iranians died. \n 1993-2010 - Israel calls for Iran to be bombed, launches practice raids. United States gives Israel Arms and technology to defend itself from the majority in the middle east who do not support an Israeli settlement. \n 1998 - Irans regional neighbors, India/Pakistan get nukes, no long term sanctions are placed on them. \n 2002 - In the wake of 9/11 the USA places Iran in Axis of Evil, even though not a single hijacker or member involved in the planning of the attacks were Iranian. In fact about half of them were from Saudi Arabia, a close ally of the bush administration and a large supplier of oil to the US. No sanctions were place on Saudia Arabia in the wake of 9/11. \n 2003 - US invades Iraq and Afghanistan. Troops are also based in Saudi Arabia and Turkey.

            "As someone who paid for his entire BS with financial aid and various part time jobs, I would like to say that it is still possible. \n Aright, I read the article and did a bit of math myself. \n First off, this title of this thread is just plain wrong. Today's tuition at UW is [less than $13,000/yr]( not $20,000/yr. On top of that WU is a horrible representation of the tuition rate in the US.  WU was ranked the [14th best college in the entire US last year]( right ahead of Brown and Cornell. Of course the tuition rates at the top universities in the country are going to be higher than what a summer job can pay for. \n Now let's take a look at  a bit more down to earth university,  my alma mater, Florida State University. FSU is a respected state university, but it isn't anything over the top amazing. It was ranked  #97 among all universities in the US  runs you just under $4,000, or a third of what the article was claiming to be regular tuition (and less than a quarter what the title of this thread claimed). \n As a graduate of Florida State University, class of 2012, I can tell you that it is more than reasonable that a part time job will support you through college, which this article claims is impossible. I did it. Financial aid picked up a whopping 100% of my college tuition and even paid me some living expenses. I covered the rest with my own job. \n It is complete BS if you think the federal government should pay the full tab for going to a university as prestigious as WU. If you really want to go to a school THAT good, either fork up the cash or bust your ass enough to get an academic scholarship. And to be completely honest, if you are smart enough to get the full use out of such an esteemed university, you will either be able to get that scholarship, or whatever job you get will pay back the loans you need to get pretty darn quick. \n In other words this article is ridiculously misleading.  I went through the system. I didn't get a single dime of help from my parents. Federal aid was MORE than sufficient in helping me out.

In many cases the person(s) in charge have exhibited skills in areas for making game elements, but they are not skilled or experienced in people management. I am not saying this to point fingers, but to let you know yours is perhaps the most common problem in across every kind of game dev environment. \n Nothing I can say will be a magic bullet, but I am happy to share some best practices that have helped my teams in the past. \n \n Get one or a few Big Goals up on a whiteboard where everyone can see them. These should be arrived at via respectful conversation, and need to indicate what your group is trying to do. Big picture, high altitude goals like \"Create one game per semester\" for example. Other human facing goals can be statements like \"Allow each person to contribute, share work equally\". \n \n Whoever is in charge needs to ensure that discussions about decisions stay focused on What Is Good For The Game, and not become about ego's. This can be tricky, but just keep using that question as a benchmark as the basis for further discussion. By using an objective rule like that as the 'judge', one can keep a lot of the minefields defused. \n \n Look into Agile & Scrum methodologies for turning ideas into tasks that create deliverables. Scrum methods put all the work in front of the whole team, where problems can be found and addressed, and useless twits like SP1 & 2 can have a light shone on them. There is a very nice level of peer pressure that occurs when others in the meeting show what they have accomplished, and the dawdlers have nothing to show.

We use several Konica Minolta printers at each of our locations, and use the built in FTP function to scan to each person's workstation (they have a Konica FTP program running at each station to receive data). In the printer's FTP settings, you have the choice to send data to IP or hostname. For some locations, scanning to host name works, in others it does not. If I could scan to host names at all locations it would alleviate the process of having to either assign static leases to each workstation, or just having to constantly reconfigure the settings. \n The administrative office has a server running 2008, which acts as a DNS and AD server along with some other core services...At the admin office, I can set my hostname as the station to scan to, and the data is sent just fine. I can ping by hostname to other hosts on the network. The admin office employs a SonicWall firewall/router, and all workstations use Windows 7. \n At any other location, scanning to hostname from the printer does not work. I can ping by hostname and even connect to a host via FTP using my PC's command prompt, but the scan function of the printer will just lock up and not connect. There is a variety of hardware at the other locations, basic small office/home routers, a few DD-WRT routers, Windows 7, few Vista, fewer XP, but no servers besides the admin office. \n I've asked some of the support techs at KM and have received different views from each, mostly ending with, \"well it  should  work\", but receiving very little help.

With MSN, we had quite a hefty amount of customization and features.You could personalize the client to suit your tastes, send custom animated gifs, record voice clips, send nudges and even include a 'hand written' message. All of these features were fantastic, and I genuinely used all of them. \n Skype came along with its superior voice and video call quality, and seemingly overnight, MSN was abandoned. Now, Skype iteself  was  a pretty solid IM client. Sure, it was bare-bones, but it certainly got the job done, and it had a very simple, but acceptable level of customization. As annoyed as I was to ditch MSN for it, I accepted it and moved on, as Skype wasn't bad. It was just lacking. \n Unfortunately, nowadays Skype is just outright terrible. I'm noticing friends abandon it left and right, but for what? Discord or Telegram, usually. \n Now, I love Discord for the most part. I think it's one of the best IM clients out there. (although that's not really saying much, when there are barely any decent alternatives.) My main gripe with it is the lack of customization. I would gladly dump Skype in a heartbeat if they simply added the option to separate private IM windows from the main client - yet this feature is gradually becoming phased out with modern IM clients. Why? It's so useful! \n Telegram though? I don't get it. People love this thing to bits, but I just can't stand it. It's so bare-bones and lacking. There's barely any features, but people seem to be all over it? -and- you need to login with your phone number to use the service? I don't understand how that's a good thing at all. It honestly confuses me. \n Maybe I'm just too dismissive of change. I clung onto MSN for as long as possible, even using the 'MSN Reviver' patch up until 2013, when the service was eventually  shut down and I still currently use an older version of Skype.(6.21, released in 2014) But surely I can't be the only person who misses a good, solid, customizable instant messaging experience?": "software",
            "At first I was extremely eager to receive this phone. I've always preferred physical keyboards over touch, as upgrading from my Nokia E71 to an Xperia Arc in 2011 was always one of my bigger tech-related regrets.

Not to mention that I can only seem to fit one post at a time on this screen! If only I could resize the interface. \n How long have I been using this app for? How much battery have I used so far? Let me just minimize the app to check - Ah, there we go. Gosh, if only I could just have the time and battery indicators at the top of the screen constantly. \n Hey, Nintendo's new Miitomo app is out, and my friends are all using it!

You cannot use this app at this time. Please close the application\" - WELP. \n This was the final straw for me.

The best way to do this, as in any economy, is to charge a premium for higher data caps. Customers who are willing to pay more get more, and those that aren't don't clog up the network. \n If Verizon offered unlimited data to everybody for free, or even a reasonable price, their networking infrastructure wouldn't be able to sustain it.

            "A lot of people in this thread are saying that the Grizzlies were the best matchup against the Warriors in the league, but I very much disagree. They may be the most different match up, but I think that's more in our favor than theirs. \n Let me explain why. The Warriors had the best ranked defense in the league this season. For Memphis, this means guys like Draymond, Bogut, and Ezeli to contain/slow down Gasol/Z-BO. In addition, Memphis isn't the greatest team in the perimeter, and we have great perimeter defenders in Klay, Iggy, and Livingston. With a very monotonous offense (Gasol/ZBO in the paint, Lee outside, and TA not doing much), the Grizzlies really had to step it up offensively to beat the Warriors in scoring alone. Their biggest (not static) threats were Conley's ability to score 3s or slash to the basket, Carter's ability to score off the bench, Jeff Green's potential to go off (not consistently), and Udrih's mid range jumper. Other than Conley and maybe Carter, the Grizzlies can't rely on these alone to provide enough extra points on top of Lee's 3s and Gasol's/ZBO's points in the paint. \n Now let's move to the other end of the floor. The Warriors' obvious scoring potential comes from Curry and Klay hitting 3s. These are easily contained by TA and Conley, but they can only get by so many screens (on and off the ball) before both they and the Splash Bros get tired out. Gasol/ZBO do a great job of locking down the paint, so how else can the Warriors score? Harrison Barnes' midrange jumper was the biggest thing keeping the Warriors alive this series. He's also a great 3pt shooter from the corner, and Draymond can score from behind the arc when given enough space. Bogut almost never scores, which left him open in the paint, giving up about 4-6 points per game. Bring in Iggy, DLee, Speights, and Barbosa off the bench, and we have just enough extra points to beat out the Grizzlies. \n All things considered, a fully health Grizzlies team should take a fully healthy Warriors team to 6 or 7 games, in favor of the Warriors. This is solely due to the match up, and not the quality of either team (I think records aside, the Grizzlies and Warriors are comparable teams in overall skill). It's unfortunate that the Grizzlies matched up with the Warriors, because I think they could've done much more work on the Rockets or Clippers. They'd be a truly terrifying team if they figured out their perimeter offense.": "nba"

            "Hi all. So recently I got my HTC Vive and have been enjoying it very much. I tried overclocking both the CPU and GPU for the first time last week. I used Unigine Valley and got my ASUS Strix 970 up to about  +190 Core Clock  and about  +350 in Memory Clock . I only benchmarked in Unigine Valley, running those 18 scenes. So far so good, no artifacts or anything. \n I also did something else, applying default OC for the CPU in the bios. I have a  ASUS Z97I-PLUS  MB and a  4690K  air cooled with a  Hyper 212  in a small Fractal Node 304 case. I know auto OC from bios is not the best way to go, but I gave it a try. Just for funsies. It ended on somewhere around 4.2 GHz. Did not run any Prime 95 or anything to test the CPU OC. \n I ran MSI Kombustor during one night, and came back the next morning and saw that the program had failed some time during the night. Could be the GPU, could be a bug in the software, I dont know. \n Anyway, when running VR games after the applied OC, I am seeing some issues. Some games drop frames.  Vanishing Realms  gets choppy when entering the open area. Something that goes away when I remove the GPU OC.  Space Pirate Trainer  is running way better after the OC, but then again, this could have been fixed in software. The issue is that there are bugs in SteamVR, with bluetooth drivers and what not, so the fault could lie somewhere else. \n Why does the frame drop happen? Is this a result of me pushing the GPU to much, or a common error when not testing the OC good enough? Or something else? \n Sorry I cannot provice any screenshots now, I am away from the computer.

            "How QoS is sold to clients is that it's network magic, everything just suddenly will be perfect, everyone will be happy, no one will ever say the network is slow, and voice calls will never be choppy. \n QoS does nothing to protect priority traffic from itself or to protect anything else from the priority traffic. \n Your point on the inbound DOS vulnerability it true, I'll give you that.  But, when that happens, you can identify the culprit and focus the blame where it should be.  Typical enterprise networks might have a DOS once or twice a year.  Performance complaints start the moment someone sits down at a computer. \n Traffic shaping and RFC 970 queueing is about managing performance and perception, which is what the initial complaint was about.   It does it very well. \n Jim's work is about eliminating this argument altogether.  Zero queues on network equipment mean no configuration, no design, no debate, no argument.  Either an application works, or it won't.  If an app doesn't work, build another server and move it closer to the users.  Zero queues makes network performance black and white, and the people selling networks could have anyone support them as it would be close to just plugging in cables.  (Yes, I'm simplifying the Bufferbloat concept, but taking Jim's argument to its logical conclusion, Zero buffering would be better than what we have now, and network engineers wouldn't need to know anything other than how to run cable.) \n In truth, you need shaping/RFC970 to manage performance, and QoS to manage DOS.  The two do not operate independently as well as they operate together. \n What burns my biscuits is when someone complains about performance, and the answer is QoS.  Outside of a few specific scenarios, MPLS style 7 FIFO queues will not \"Make the network faster\".  Nagle's RFC970 and shaping will make the apps perform faster.     Or....  Maybe Jim is right, zero out the buffers and make the problem black and white so that the network engineers stop arguing about it. \n 20 years ago, bufferbloat wouldn't have worked.  The underlying protocols wouldn't have dealt with that much selective loss.  Now, TCP has SACK, and half a dozen or so congestion control formulas that will cruise right through without skipping a beat.": "networking",

Ping between the two system and measure the average round trip time. \n Now, set up the two ports to be on separate vlans as access ports (switchport access vlan x).  Ping between the two systems and measure the average round trip time. \n From my memory, when I did this in the 2004 timeframe for this very reason (setting up servers on individualized subnets) across two ports in a single 6509, the rtt difference between same vlan and separate vlans was 0.4ms.  Which means, for every 1000 complete transactions, the network would add 0.4 seconds of time. \n For the Oracle app that I was modeling at the time, this meant that the total amount of time that the additional network latency would add every hour was a few minutes (3 minutes sticks in my head). \n In other words, most of the time, even a poorly written DB app doing 1000's of  serialized  transactions a second would not be significantly impacted. \n But, that was 10 years ago.

            "I will argue a technicality.  You can QoS inbound traffic if you have the bandwidth and you design it the right way. \n Let's say you have a 50/15 line, 50 incoming, 15 outgoing.  If you don't mind losing some of your bandwidth, you can create an artificial choke point in front of your external router that not only marks DSCP (which is useless on the Internet or when the WAN traffic is encrypted), but traffic shapes and applies more intelligent queuing disciplines. \n It goes like this.  Outbound, you can traffic shape to the 15 Mbps as long as you account for the encryption and topology overhead of the network.  If you are using multiple encapsulations with encryption, don't expect to get a full 15 Mbps out of the line.  Read up on Ethernet Overhead Accounting.  The ability to adjust for encryption and network overhead is key to making this work. \n Incoming, you'll need allow only a portion of the bandwidth through.   Generally, the slower the line, the lower the percentage to be able to get this right.  We used to run inbound bandwidth at 70% of the line on fractional T1's in the 90's.  I've run inbound gig lines at 97% with good success.  You'll want to test the line and see at what point that the congestion begins to create additional latency over the line and then adjust for just under that point. \n On a 50 Mbps inbound speed, I'd expect to run at around 90%-95% on the traffic shaping as long as I've also adjusted for network and encryption overhead correctly.  Let's assume 45 Mbps with 96 bytes overhead per packet (GRE + IPSec ). \n From there, you apply a fairly basic multi-class policy on the inbound traffic.  Let's say 15 Mbps for your priority traffic, 15 Mbps for voice/video, and 15 Mbps for everything else. \n Now, the next key to this is the queuing for each class.  For the inbound priority traffic, you can allocate a large buffer, hold a bunch of packets if you'd like.  It's situationally dependant.  But, for the voice/video and the default classes, short queue everything.  64 packets maybe.  128 if you really feel adventurous. \n Basically, it comes to this.  Voice and video, it's better to drop packets than insert a bunch of jitter by holding them on the router.  No one will bat an eyelash if you drop 2% of a 20ms G.711 audio stream, they probably wouldn't be able to tell.  But, if you let those packets queue up on the router for a half second, people are going to complain.  Drop them packets like a hot potato. \n Same with the default class, short queue it.  With TCP, dropped packets are a signal to the sender to slow down, and if you are taking enough packets to start to queue up packets on your choke point router, you want dropbox to slow down, drop them packets. \n The last item is this, FIFO sucks.  Cisco and Linux support fair queueing, use it.  If you take the above class/queueing concepts and change all of the queues to fair queueing, network magic happens.  Same ideas, you can have long per-flow queues on the priority traffic, but the voice/video and default classes should have very short individual flow queues.  I've done between 1 and 4 packet queues per flow with very good results. \n This is the": "networking",

In my work with the app, I found something that someone here might find of use. \n fstrim and discard works on filesystems created on ram disks.  For example: \n /bin/rm -fr /mnt/loopdir\n/bin/mkdir /mnt/loopdir\n/bin/rm -fr /mnt/ramdisk\n/bin/mkdir /mnt/ramdisk\n/bin/mount -t tmpfs tmpfs /mnt/loopdir\n/bin/dd if=/dev/zero of=/mnt/loopdir/loopdisk bs=1M count=200\n/sbin/losetup /dev/loop0 /mnt/loopdir/loopdisk\n/sbin/mkfs.btrfs -L ramdisk /dev/loop0\n/bin/mount -vt btrfs -o autodefrag,compress=zlib,space_cache,discard /dev/loop0 /mnt/ramdisk/\n \n That creates a 200 mbyte btrfs loopdisk on the tmpfs file system on loopdir.  fstrim -v /mnt/ramdisk works.  Creating and then deleting files in /mnt/ramdisk causes the btrfs volume to allocate and then trim/discard the volume space. \n There are a number of advantages to this method of ramdisk creation.

            "When it comes to interactive programs, like games, the concept behind bufferbloat is 100% wrong. \n It's the only situation where enacting bufferbloat type policies is counterproductive.  But it is completely opposite of what you'd want to attempt if you were serious about making an interactive app work appropriately. \n The concept behind bufferbloat is simple.  If the packets have been held over X period of time, drop them. \n For voip or video, this is beneficial, as total latency and jitter have a direct impact to the perception of the quality of the audio/video stream, much more so than a dropped packet.  For bulk data, since TCP SACK, it's a small increase in bandwidth use with a decrease in overall flow throughput, generally a positive. \n But dropping packets for an interactive app where the data must be delivered byte for byte exactly between client and server just causes a rtt*2+recovery jump in lag, and doesn't save any bandwidth and degrades the perception of the performance of the application dramatically.

I know this is a Nexus 6 subreddit, but please down vote only if my information is wrong, not because you disagree. \n The Note 4 is the better phone right now, by a considerable margin. I say right now because when the Nexus 5 was released it too had a rough start and now it's one of the best devices around. My issues stem from a few areas: \n \n Performance - encrypted or unencrypted this phone has problems and no one can really argue with it. Some of it stems from Lollipop, but there is something fundamentally wrong with this phone. Games and applications stutter (see XDA thread about gaming, games working fine on the N5 lag on the Nexus 5 and so on). I/O speeds are just not great, personally I think it stems from the Ram having issues. \n \n The other side of this is that Kernels, Roms, and Lollipop evolution will make up for these issues and overtime will make them more forgettable. \n \n Battery life - I'm sorry but the battery life being seen on the N6 is not very impressive. Project Volta? That's the best you can swing. Again this WILL get better with time, but for now it is really really bad. The Nexus 5 sees improvements, but the N6 doesn't seem to gain any ground. Against the Note 4 it's really rough. \n \n There are some other things as well such as poor cellular signal being reported (I understand the bars and AOSP and how they work/differ), a camera that is coupled with software lacking some of the most basic of options we expect today (120/240 slomo, 24/30/60fps) and stereo recording in video. \n \n Other random issues are around as well such as popping speakers, inferior DSP (powers speakers), half the screen working, poor screen calibration.. The list goes on. \n \n \n I finally come to my conclusion. Of the issues I mentioned above I totally expect in due time that the camera, battery and things like the speakers to be patched over by developers, possibly Google itself, and things like Viper4Android. Color calibration can be corrected with Kernels like Franco Kernel and camera software through things like L Camera. Updates for the radio will roll out and improve, and it will always be at the forefront of development when compared to other devices out today. \n Everything about the Nexus 6 (from what I have read and seen) is that it is not what it could be or should be for this much money. Although it is pitched as a consumer device, and priced as such, I can't help but leave feeling I don't get my money's worth of a device when comparing it to the Note 4 and it is still very much a developer device, and as developers know all to well the initial release is never the best, but it gets better over time. But how good will it get? \n Right now, today the Note 4 gives you a better screen, not just in calibration but in generation. It also includes Gorilla Glass 4 not 3 as is on the Nexus 6. It has faster charging, better radios, better noise canceling, a better camera, better battery... You lose wireless charging, stereo speakers and a development community (although the T-Mobile Note is awesomely supported, just not as good as the Nexus is)..

            "Here's my take on the subject: \n History Lesson \n Long back Microsoft commented that they want to become a service rather than die a product. So how do you stay relevant in a world where the majority of the population is on mobile where Microsoft barely has a hold? Windows on phone however decent it may be, hasn't gained as much traction as Microsoft had hoped and hence the need to spread out. \n See this is the exact mistake Nokia made buy not jumping on the Android bandwagon and instead kept going with Symbian which was old and decaying. \n Current Scenario \n Okay, so lets focus on android. OEMs make their own skin and identify themselves with it. They do not lend it to others (MIUI is an exception for whole other reasons) and it keeps things tied to their ecosystem. \n Now for an OEM to gain market acceptance, it need to have GAPPS package which is given only if you pass the Google Compatibility Suite. Also the Open Handset Alliance requirements are so strict that they made Acer drop Alibaba from releasing Aliyun OS with them, which was an of-shoot of android. \n Why? Because it would take away business from Google in China. \n Now the benefit of sticking with Google besides the latest OS code is GAPPS which is what a common person looks for in a phone. They will simply want at least Play Store to be present and hence OEMs want it. So what can Microsoft do? \n Microsoft ^Services \n Microsoft has a 2 core set of apps. One for Businesses and others for Consumer. They have Search, Email, Maps and a few other services with them right now. What's missing is an App Store, Video, Music, Books and Magazines and you have successfully created a very good alternative to Google. \n Now many will say, \"Hey Bing is Sh*t\", but I don't quite agree. They have been slowly upgarding their services now. \n Guess who recently took over Nokia and got a ton of patents and their awesome MAP service?  Microsoft \n Which company has the best office suite?  Microsoft \n Hey remember the email service which caters to a large number of business? Something with Exchange in the name?

Long term plans in small steps and lo and behold the MCU is created. \n They don't want to die as builders of software alone. Why else do you think that the next gen windows is basically free?\nBecause they are a service now. Google is a service and we all know where they are right now. \n Back to Topic \n Okay, so the investment. CYGN is the only reputable provider right now building ROMs for OEMs. Yes, since they are not attached to Hardware they can make software for many devices and people will still identify with them. They recently said that they want to take android away from Google. Now I don't know how they'll do this but this is where Microsoft can help. \n I just mentioned that Microsoft is almost near providing alternatives to Google Apps.

Its has nothing more than precisely required.\nThat's how it was made. Google made it such that OEMs add their custom features and give it their own identity. Lets be very clear, according to Google, 90%+ devices have the latest Google Play services installed and it provides the important features to old phones. So in a makeshift kind of way they are updated, and will be updated this way for a long time. \n As for the Stock android experience, can I make a call on it? Yeah sure but I can't have noise cancellation settings, boost volume, record, take notes directly and some more little things which OEMs provide.\nI can take a picture, sure but then I lose all the tiny little things that OEMs provide. Even I thought it would be a gimmick but the number of times I have made a funny GIF, made me change my views. And please don't mention music. Just Don't. \n Its a very common problem with humans, most of the time we blindly follow what others tell us. The faith increases if the person is wearing a suit/uniform or is sitting in another part of the world writing an article on a website. \n That's the biggest problem with the OEM bashing. People buy some low end phone and think that it will compete with the top end phones out there. Oh! my dialer takes 0.3 sec more than the latest developer phones, it must be the OEM. No, person XYZ of website ABC says that Stock android is better/ OEM skin is bad, so it must be. Let me go on and cry about it to others. \n Seriously, Stop it! \n Android L is a step towards making the stock android experience better, but it still has ways to go to compete with the OEM skins. \n The only drawback of OEM skins is that we don't get the latest version of android as quickly as we would like. Yes I agree on that, but just so you can have a few new features in 6 months, you are willing to loose all the good features you already have? OEMs have picked the pace and try to get the latest android to people quicker than the past years and this will improve. \n So please stop crying over OEM skins and enjoy the little things. You made your choice when you bought the device, appreciate it.": "Android",
            "So I finally decided to flash CM 12.1 on my phone and get rid of the issues plaguing stock. \n Anyway I followed the guide on xda and unlocked the bootloader (Model XT1068 Dual Sim) and unlocked it. Then I used CF-Auto root to root it and installed TWRP manager from the Play store and installed TWRp-2.8.7.0 for titan on it. \n All well till now. Then I took a backup of the stock ROM and saved it on my PC. Lastly I flashed CM12.1 and it said \"updater binary outdated something, cannot install over inappropriate data\", I realised my mistake and then wiped /system, /cache, /dalvik and /data. Then I flashed the zip again and it stuck on \"patching system image unconditionally\" for about 20 mins. I forced my phone off and then restored stock ROM.

            "This thing requires a little more mouse clicks and patience that an ordinary post \n Hi guys! A few weeks back I posted about my doubt about buying a new PC or buying an used one and all of that hinged on the fact that I had to sell my laptop. Now, today finally I have asked a guy to buy it. If I end up selling it (Acer V5 i5 4200U, 4GB, 128 SSD, GT750 4GB) then I will have some money to use for my desktop. You guys convinced me to buy a new PC so here I am with a few doubts. \n --Really sorry if this sounds needy, I do need some experienced people to help me out-- \n I stay in china, hence the mail in rebates and crazy discounts don't apply here. I play a lot of AA titles, but not very frequently.

So I wanted a smaller PC. Mini-ITX fit the bill but the price becomes 4300 RMB for CPU alone considering that I can get GTX 970 for 4400 RMB and it kills my budget. \n Now [this case]( is what I have found but it seems that it is big too. \n I know people here like to build their own and let me assure you that the pre assembled model also comes in boxes and I have to build it myself, the benefit is that it costs way less than if I tried buying everything separately. \n I also wanted a 2 monitor setup, but that's a little too much to ask right now. \n \n Anyway is MINI-ITX worth the price? \n Live with the normal chasis and suck it up? \n GTX 970 worth destroying my budget for?

            "Hello reddit.  \n Me: 24M \n Her: 24F \n Let me start at the beginning. March 5 2008. I start dating a wonderful girl in high school. The most popular one. I was the loser. Stereotypical high school romance, we kissed, we hung out a lot, we talked about sex but said we wanted to save it for when we were ready. We were happy. We loved each other. \n September 2008, we start university. Things are fine and dandy until the end of December when my parents start saying they don't approve of my girlfriend. I leave. I move in with a friend for a few months. I get a great job and blow it because I don't get up in the morning, and I feel depressed. Because of this I also fail my first year, putting me on probation. \n September 2009. Things are great, I'm finally taking classes I want (computer science). My relationship with my girlfriend is great, we're talking all the time, chatting, etc. \n November 2009. I join the naval reserve. My parents hate it, and the stress it puts on us forces me to move out. Again. I move to a bachelor suite apartment. Life is crap. \n January 2010. I start becoming violent towards my girlfriend. Things are shaky, and then, one day, after a fight we had, I walk out to go and calm down. She starts to head home. It's 10 at night. She has to walk a couple blocks downtown. She gets to the bus station and pulled to the parking lot and gets raped. \n I can't believe it. I feel like it was all my fault. Like I should have been better to her, should have been there for her. I don't know what to do. I talk to her and she tells me about it, and I help her heal. \n April 2010. I move my things back to my parents' house because I'm leaving for Basic Training. I let my girlfriend use my laptop while I'm gone because hers is crap. First week, she finds some pictures I had on there that I didn't want her to find (I know, shouldn't have been looking at them in the first place. I learned). I give her a call when I can, and she lights me up. Just furious. \n She says I have until the end of basic to show that I've changed. Until then, she thinks it's okay to hang out with and go to dinner with random guys she meets that ask her out. She never goes home with them, just gets free suppers from them. \n August 2010. I come home for three days. We stay in a hotel in my home town since it's the first time we've seen each other for two months. I get a tattoo with her name in it (in Vietnamese characters (like Chinese). Her idea). I go away again for a month. \n September 2010. I'm away for more military training. She's home. She tells me she cheated on me in February with one of our \"friends\". I don't even know how to feel. I take a few moments and feel that I deserved it and tell her I'll take her back. She's surprised and says she'll show me that she'll never do that again. \n So things seem great at this point. Sure a bit shaky since the whole cheating thing, but yeah. \n 2011 to 2013 are pretty much a blur. She moved away because she failed University and her parents wouldn't understand, so she tells them she's in an internship program. I'm thinking \"Okay, we've been doing the long distance thing for a while since I've been away on ships, this'll be fine.\" \n November 2013. She has some male friends over to her apartment that she's showing the city to. I don't really worry about it, don't care. I come there in early December to be with her, and she's distant as hell. I can't figure out what's wrong. Turns out one of her friends had fingered her while she was asleep, so she felt numb to any affection.  \n During my time there (until early January) we try and have sex a few times (initiated by her), but it always ends in her tears because it hurts her too much. I'm worried as hell about her, but she says she'll be ok. \n March 21 2014. She leaves to go to Disneyland with a few of her friends she made on League of Legends. I think \"Great. A nice vacation for her.\" \n March 30 2014. She returns. Every time I landed from my plane trips, I'd call her. I'd let her know I landed. Her? No. I text \"Hey make sure to call me when you land!\" \n Her: \"Oh I'm in customs, I'll call you on my way home\" \n Me: \"Ok.\" \n 3 hours later \n Me: \"Hey I hope you're okay...\" \n Her: \"Yeah I'm just playing league.\" \n Me: \"...oh. Well I just feel kind of pushed aside right now.\" \n And I explain my feelings. She says she wants to take a break from our relationship so she can have some time to think. At this point I'm thinking \"Oh no did something happen.\" so I ask one of her friends that went with her to Disneyland if I should be worried about my relationship with her. He says \"I hate to bear bad news, but maybe.\" \n March 31 2014. I confront her about it. She says she doesn't have any romantic feelings for me anymore. That she has started to have feelings for one of the guys that she went to Disneyland with. I'm crushed. I basically say \"If you loved me there wouldn't be a second.\" \n We break up. \n It's April 1 2014.  \n It's not an April Fool's joke. However much I wish to God it was. \n I've been trying to get over her since but it's so hard. I see her friends uploading pictures of their trip and I can't help but feel this painful pit in my stomach whenever I see her. Knowing she'll never look at me with love in her eyes again. \n She was my life. \n And now she's gone. \n I don't know what to do, what to think. I've tried breaking contact with her but every time I do I just get sucked back into the feelings I have for her. \n It's so hard.": "relationships",

            "To start off with, I'm not trying to force her to do anything. I'm not very assertive in this relationship. I think this is because in my previous relationship I started to overdo it and became abusive. And I don't want that to happen again. \n With that out of the way, I'm in the Royal Canadian Navy and currently on a 1.5 month deployment where the only contact I have is emails and small websites. I've been dating her for about 6 months now and while I get a huge rush talking to her and just listening to her voice, I don't feel like she gets the same feeling. \n I made her and I a website that we could use to send letters of any size to each other, it has a heart beating to the left and a text box on the right. It took me around four hours to make, and I had hoped to have it be used pretty extensively. Not the case, so far. \n I've written around 18 letters to her, she's written 2. One of which consists of \"hello\" and the other was telling me she had tried to call me back on the satellite phone we have but it didn't work and to call her when I got it. \n I've been sailing for around three weeks by now and that and three phone calls is the only contact we've had. I did some looking around and found that in the physical/emotional love side of things, she's the emotional type. Not the \"Oh my god I want to be with you forever\" but the \"Yes we're together but you're #4 on my priority list after job, education, family and friends.\" \n When reading about emotional lovers, it says that I have to make the relationship easy for her and that criticism and negative comments will just push them away further. \n I want to tell her that it's pretty important to me to get these letters every once in a while and see that she's making an effort to stay in contact, but I don't want her to see it as a job, you know? \n Whenever we talk on the phone/Skype, she's super happy to talk to me and obviously wants us to stay together, but when we text and do anything but face-to-face/voice she seems reluctant to communicate that way. \n Maybe I'm just being way too dependant on her, and should find validation elsewhere. What do you guys think?": "relationships",
            "So here's the deal. I've been seeing this amazing girl for about one week thus far. We met at a friendly gathering with some of mine and her friends. \n A couple of weeks beforehand, my friend told me that his girlfriend likes to play matchmaker and wanted to try and set me up with one of her friends. \n So, this get-together was planned for about a week, and I knew that they wanted to set me up with a girl, but I wasn't sure who it was. Fast forward to the gathering, and I was just chatting with them, having a great time. One of the girls seemed fairly interested in me, but I wasn't so much into her mostly because, well, I'm shallow and she wasn't that attractive to me. \n I mentioned this to my friend while we were leaving with them who then asked which girl I would be more interested in getting to know better. I pointed out the seemingly shy girl in the corner with great cat-like eyes, dimples, and long straight brown hair. He excitedly said \"Yeah that's her\" \n We eventually made it back to one of the girls' houses and went to her basement to continue the night, chatting about what they did at school and what they've done. Sharing funny youtube videos and short videos they had taken of a marathon during which they said some awkward things. \n Then, while getting a ride home, I was in the back seat along with her (the girl I fancied), and we chatted a bit. I took my phone out and wrote her name into the contacts field, and gave it to her. She put her number in and did the same for me. We get to my house and I kind of quietly say while I'm leaving \"Call you later?\" to which she replied \"Yeah sure.\" \n The next day, I call her which, in my view, was just to say \"Hey, I haven't forgotten about you, and sober me is still interested in getting to know you.\" \n She answered the phone, and what followed must have been the most awkward conversation I've ever had with anyone before. Lots of pauses and awkward giggles from both sides. I never expected to schedule something with her, just a short chat. Then I, making small talk, asked her if she had seen this one movie. \n \"No, why? Did you have any plans?\" \n At this point I was like \"Oh s t. I don't know what to do here. Umm... F k it. Ask her out.\" \n So I go all in and ask her out. She says yes! We go to see the movie a couple of days later, followed by a walk by the river (during which she holds onto my arm). Then we went to a nice burger place I know of, went back to my place (I live with my (55m/55f) parents), went into my basement and proceeded to play a couple of games on my PS3. \n She started to get tired, so I offered her the option of going home which she took. I took her home and walked her to the door. I was just planning on giving her a hug, thanking her for not skipping out on it, and leaving. \n Instead, she surprised me by inviting me inside and introduced me to her parents and her younger sister. Their reaction was quite... I want to say it was the reaction your parents would give you if you were in grade 8 and came back from a play date. \n Anyway, I head home and text her saying I enjoyed the day (the \"date\" [her words] was from 1:30~10:30pm), and that I would like to see her again the following day for a walk around the university (we have a lot of nice gardens around it) and maybe lunch afterwards. \n She agrees and we meet at the university the following day, walking through a couple of the buildings, looking at plants and such. Then we go for lunch and we start talking some more. \n I had thought of something we could do to help us get to know each other better over lunch which was one of us asks a question that the other answers, then the asker answers their own question. \n We ask things like what our favourite colour is, what our full name is, etc. I also asked \"Is the reason why you don't hold my hand because you don't think I want it, or maybe you're not ready for it?\" She gives me a bit of a back story about her friends and how they usually didn't do things like that because their other friends might feel awkward, but that she was fine with it when it was just us. Then I ask \"Are we a thing?\" \n \"Yeah I'd like to think so.\" and I feel great about what has been happening so far. \n So I had asked her later (I had to leave town for the weekend) if she'd like to go to mini golf on Tuesday (today). She was all for it, and we went and played mini golf (we both got the same score in the end, oddly enough). We also walked around the mall awkwardly holding hands (because we're super awkward and the 5\" difference [6'2\" vs 5'9\"] makes her arm bend which she feels is annoying) and looking at stuff that was for sale on tables. \n We have lunch and chat some more, and then she goes home to get ready for work. \n So, given the back story, here's a couple things that really stand out to me. \n \n My previous relationship was over six years, during which I got used to my SO (same age as me) replying right away to my texts. My new girlfriend (?) takes a while to reply and has explained that her phone (a samsung galaxy. no s#) has some problems with its messaging app, but she's not getting a new phone until her current contract runs out. \n I wouldn't say she's distant, but most of the negative feelings I get from this is specifically because she takes so long to reply, I feel like she doesn't feel as strongly about this relationship as I do. \n I feel like I'm rushing into this and need to take it slower, but I don't really know how aside from not talking to her for longer periods of time which I think is just me playing a game to see if she will text me out of the blue instead of me always texting her. \n \n Anyway, I guess what I need more than anything is a little reassurance that things are going great and that I need to calm the f*k down and stop reading so much into little things. \n Thanks for reading!": "relationships",

            "Most kernel devs do it because they have the device.  Then they move on and support stops.  Some devs hang around and still release updates even after getting a new device. \n As for the slow updates on the kernels, some may have moved on, but also the upstream updates have slowed as well.  Typically, once you get this far into a device's lifecycle, you are only getting maintenance updates anyway.  The innovators tend to focus their efforts on the new devices which is why you typically don't see new features as often, especially in kernels. \n As for ROMs, the first part applies here too.  Many move on and only develop on the devices they own or even just the primary device.  On the other hand, as opposed to kernels, ROMs tend to be more innovative, especially if they already have the device framework in place.

Around 2002, I was working at the customer service counter and handled returns, problems, etc. Well, good ol' Ron comes into the store. He buys a pair of cheap speakers. On the price tag, it showed a price of $39.98 for the pair. \n OK, let me add some relevant information before I go further. Best Buy pricing guidelines for regularly priced products always ended in \".99.\" Other cent values were used to indicate different things, like something ending in \".60\" was open box product. And for some reason Best Buy liked to list speakers with both the individual price and the price for a pair on the tag, even if they were only sold as a pair (the tag would also say that they were only sold in pairs--this wasn't the issue). This meant speaker pairs were almost always priced to end in \".98\" since they had two \".99\" priced items in a package, making up the \".98.\" \n OK, so anyway, he buys a set of speakers that were labeled on the shelf at $39.98. He goes through the front register, pays, and as he was walking to the door, he notices that the receipt says \"$39.99.\" So, he was overcharged by a penny. Now, he heads straight to customer service and shows me the receipt and demands a refund. I proceed to process the refund and hand/try to hand him a new receipt and the penny, apologized, and said that I would have the signage corrected. At this point, he just starts yelling that we were scamming consumers by ripping them off by charging an extra penny and how much that adds up to over time. Now, he wants a full refund for the speakers, but still wants to keep them. I explain that I would be happy to provide a refund for the speakers if he wanted to return them, or I would return the amount he was overcharged. I again offered him the penny. \n Now, by this time, he is yelling at me telling me I better refund his money and allow him to keep the speakers since we tried to rip him off. I calmly offered to credit him 10% of the price for the inconvenience, primarily just to shut him up and get him to leave. He wasn't having any of it. As loud as he can, he begins screaming out into the store (which was nearly empty in the late evening and before they carpeted it--it was mostly tile except for the CD/movie section, so surely every customer in there heard it) \"MANAGER! I WANT THE MANAGER NOW! GET ME YOUR FUCKING MANAGER! I'M DONE DEALING WITH YOUR UNDERPAID, UNEDUCATED ASS! WHERE IS THE FUCKING MANAGER?! MANAGER!! MANAGER!!\" At this time loss prevention (security/the guy at the front door) comes over at about the same time time manager does. He screams the situation to the manager, and the manager, who was quite pissed off at the scene he was causing, gave him two options--return the speakers or take the one cent refund. \n After realizing he wasn't going to get free speakers, he agrees to accept the 10% off that I had offered. The manager told him that was no longer an offer due to his belligerence and he had 15 seconds to decide if he wanted to return the speakers or take the 1 cent refund before he would be escorted from the premises. Now, even more pissed than ever, he begins verbally assaulting the manager, me, the loss prevention guy and even the elderly female customer who was standing behind him who told him that he should be ashamed and that he was humiliating himself. He didn't decide, so management and loss prevention escorted him from the store and told him that if he returned the police would be called for trespassing. I followed as he was escorted from the store and just as he was outside the doors, I handed him his penny and a new receipt for the refund, smugly reminding him not to forget his penny. \n We never saw him in the store again.

            "I've been modding phones since QPST hacks to Nokias and old Windows and Palm phones. I've owned over 60 models of cell phone, personally, which began with a Motorola StarTAC in 1997. Android began with the OG Droid in 2009 at launch, and I've been modding most every device since then. I have run older versions of Cyanogenmod in the past, but not much since CM9 on the Galaxy Nexus. Since then, I've had some Google Play Edition devices where I didn't feel the need to change ROMs for a while. \n Now, I've used my T-Mobile d851 G3 stock but rooted for the better part of a year now. It wasn't much faster than my GPE M7 before it, but it did perform solidly. Good enough battery, at about 4 hours screen on over 10 total, with up to 6 hours continuous screen on with little standby. Respectable for a giant 2.5K screen. \n Fast forward to today, and I have been on Cyanogenmod 12.1 nightlies (which have been 100% stable so far) for about a week. The phone is significantly faster and smoother with no stuttering lag or tearing in animations like I had become used to on the LG software. Memory use is significantly lower without all the LG framework and apps running all the time. Apps remain in memory much longer and two open Chrome tabs doesn't cause everything else to reload from disk. It  feels  about 40% faster than the LG 5.0.1 (20e) stock build. (Benchmarks say 25% or so, but benchmarks aren't actual usage.) Also, it includes all the currently available patches for known vulnerabilities including stagefright, improving security since it could be who knows how long before it's actually patched in the proper channels. \n The camera still takes excellent photos and laser autofocus works as well. The Google Camera takes good, easy photos, but if you don't mind a little extra effort, the Moto camera is even better. The quality is good enough for me. 4k video works, not that I use it, but it works. OIS seems to be making good work of movement and low light isn't much different than stock. I find that on CM12.1 the Google and Moto cameras tend to use a lower ISO speed by default which helps reduce the noise that the stock camera sacrifices to get the most light possible. Anyway, this is just my experience with the camera and I use it for work and some casual photography. Nothing serious. \n The customization is nice being able to change parts of the UI with a fairly easy theme engine. Just some different colors are good as Google's design is pretty much OK for me. The other minor customization features like changing/adding/removing quick settings tiles is nice. Also I don't have to suffer with LG's terrible lockscreen anymore. I don't have knock code anymore, but double tap to wake is built into CM and works very well. And I love having Lollipop's adaptive brightness again. Being able to have brightness always adjust automatically but being able to set the minimum value on the fly is great. \n Some things that don't work as designed or simply can't be implemented... No wifi calling, VoLTE, or HD Voice. It's not a huge loss for me as I rarely used wifi calling and I could always switch to stock before traveling. Also I haven't yet been able to get the IR blaster working, but that's a minor loss. \n Now for the best part, the battery.  Usually with custom ROMs have less than optimal battery performance due to hacky workarounds and modified closed source drivers and other obstacles to unlocking the full potential of a device. But with CM12.1 on the d851, battery life has been phenomenal. 4 hours of screen on time over 10 hours to 10% was normal on LG software. Every day I've had cm12.1, including having restored all my apps and settings with Titanium Backup (which can often bring problems of its own, but it also brings apps in their full daily usage mode), my battery has been far better. \n As I sit here writing this, I'm at 38% remaining after over 9 hours active with 4 hours of screen on time. On stock, I'd be at less than 10% or maybe even dead at this point. \n The battery life was a huge and welcome surprise. It does charge the battery about 20% slower, so it takes a little over 2 hours to charge as opposed to 1:45 or so on stock. LG doesn't use quickcharge technology other than their own pretty quick charging algorithm, which doesn't seem to be available to other ROMs. It's a very minor issue. \n I was expecting to try CM12.1 for a day or two and then, inevitably wind up back on stock because of the bad battery life or the poor camera, or whatever else didn't work. But I'm not. It feels normal again. The device feels fast like it should while improving battery life in the process. I think I'll live without VoLTE and HD Voice for a significantly better user experience.": "LGG3",
            "The gas pipe should be grounded, but the NEC prevents bonding  to  a gas line  as  an equipment ground, especially since not all older buildings have bonded the gas line. This was because it was code for a long time that the gas line didn't need it's own ground since it was  in  the ground. This belief is why you used to see a secondary ground rod for TV antennas and satellite dishes that weren't bonded to the house ground. NEC requires all antennas like satellite dishes to be bonded with 10ga copper wire from the ground block with no more than 10 cable feet to the house ground, which is usually at the electrical service (or any EMT you can visually verify is connected directly to the electrical service panel). Cold water pipe bonding isn't allowed anymore for antennas. The only other acceptable option is to either run run the wires such that the ground block is withing 10 cable feet, or to drive a new ground rod and back bond it to the house grounding rod with 4ga copper. \n Years ago while trying to get a job in the tech sector, I worked for DirecTV as an installer for a while. Saw this all the time. Always had to correct it. \n Just imagine an ungrounded gas line used as a ground for a big metal lightning rod (TV or satellite antenna) on your roof. Not only could it be a bad ground due to the possible lack of grounding for the gas line, but that would also include the gas line in the primary transmission path to ground for a lightning strike. \n Then you also have the issue of having two different paths to ground, creating differing potentials on both the satellite and the house. This means that if there was a short with the satellite receiver, the current will be making a choice between the building ground and the coax braid, which is bonded to the gas pipe. And safety issues aside, this causes all sorts of electrical interference issues.": "cablefail"

            "I decided to send back the Nexus 6 and live with my Nexus 5 for a little while longer. I think I'd already made my decision before I even made the initial post, but it doesn't mean it was an easy one to come to. \n I think what the logic boiled down to for me was an issue of quality vs commitment vs quality.  I loved many aspects about the phone, but I think I was in love with the ideas put i play by the phone, and not the phone itself. \n Larger real estate:  I love it. Having more screen was great - there was so much more space for activities!  But there was a caveat with the N6 (also the final nail for me) - the AMOLED screen.  Its gorgeous, but with all of the reports of screen retention after such a short time had me aware at all times to the point that I was micromanaging my screen like some sort of unpaid job. Also, the growing \"pinkness\" - the left side of my display looked significantly more pink than the right.  I also started seeing SOME retention of the nav bars. After only two weeks and my extreme OCD. \n Stereo, front facing speakers:  I love them.  Simply put, they were some of my favorite stock speaker experiences on a phone.  Ever.  No complaints, really. \n Battery: Leaps and bounds over N5.  All I can say.  Even if its not super great (deemed by others), it was much better than my N5.  Although it was very inconsistent - some days I would get 5 hours SoT, others I'd leave it on standby and get less than 2.  Nothing changed about the environment I was in, but I recognize there are many factors that come in to play here. \n Lollipop: N6 was a great place to showcase the newest android OS... but I don't know if they did it right.  I had had Lollipop on my N5 for a month before I received my N6, and I had nothing but high expectations.  Without getting in to the encryption fiasco (which honestly didn't affect me like others, though I did notice some stutters), I'll just say that I was neither on the pro nor the against for the N6 Lollipop experience.  It felt the same, which is a good thing to me.  Sort of.  I would have liked L to take advantage of the larger screen ala TouchWiz (mostly multi window tasking, maybe stylus support).  I didn't hate it, but because I'd already had the experience be spoiled by N5, I wasn't blown away.  I had hoped that Android L would be showcased on the N6 - but I dont know if it really was. \n The next element for me was loosely tied to the and that's commitment:  Do I see myself with the N6 in a year's time?  In two year's time?  Obviously, I didn't. \n This leads me up to the third and final element, and that's price.  I'm not one of those \"Nexus should be a budget phone\" herp derps, and I have no problem spending $750 on a device Im going to be using as a daily driver - but I don't think the price point matched the quality, in order to justify year+ commitment to the phone.  If it'd been priced maybe $100-200 less (with less hiccups from the get-go), we'd all have no room to complain.": "nexus6",

We deal with dozens of proprietary software, being maintained by a single person each. \n One day recently, an email was sent out with a large attachment which everyone needed to download at some point during the day.

            "When you look at the teams Kobe and MJ were provided compared to Lebron, that's a far less noble achievement. Lebron had 7 years without good players in Cleveland and has had 4 years with several good players in Miami. \n Kobe, throughout his 17 year career, has played alongside Shaq, Gasol, Bynum, Artest, Fisher, Howard, Nash, and probably more that I'm forgetting. He had Shaq at the  beginning  of his career to help win three championships. Winning three championships at the beginning of your career will make you hesitant to leave for another team. \n MJ had Pippen, Rodman, Kerr, and a slew of other players to support him over his entire career. MJ won in his sixth season, I believe, and was under contract anyway. There's no telling what would have happened if he hadn't won a championship and his second contract had expired. He may have left in free agency as well. \n The point is, Kobe and MJ were drafted to great teams and surrounded with strong supporting players throughout their careers. Lebron was drafted to, historically, one of the worst teams in the NBA and singlehandedly carried them to the best record in the NBA on more than one occasion, including a 66 win season. When you're being called The Chosen One, King James, and the Second Coming, there is an unbelievable amount of pressure that builds to win a championship. Pressure that MJ and Kobe did not have. MJ wasn't being constantly compared to anyone because he set the precedent. Kobe was being compared to MJ because of similar playing style's and success, but it wasn't to such an intense degree because it was widely accepted that he just wasn't as talented as MJ. Lebron, on the other hand, is often regarded as having the most innate talent of any player since MJ, and that's why he will always be held under a microscope.

All while setting one of the highest NCAA passer ratings of all time. And he was starting to do the same in the NFL. He seemed to be progressing a little bit as the season ended, and the onslaught by the Patriots wasn't going to be stopped by any QB short of Peyton Manning, to be completely honest. That team was just overmatched. I fully expected him to improve in the offseason and come back a more complete QB. But he had that opportunity taken from him by Elway, just one month after Elway told him he was the QB going into training camp. I understand Manning is the golden goose, but that's not how you do business, and frankly, I hope Elway never wins a Super Bowl again because of it. I hope he has to live with failing to bring together a team that can win with Manning.

            "Well, you see... \n In its heyday, my team was virtually unstoppable.  Like, 6-championships-in-8-years unstoppable.  We had the greatest player to ever play the game in Michael Jordan, and two of the other all-time greats in Scottie Pippen and eventually Dennis Rodman.  The Bulls were known around the world, and still are today. \n Unfortunately in 1998, Michael Jordan retired, and Scottie Pippen joined the Houston Rockets in 1999, though he would return in 2003 until 2004. \n From 1999-2004, things were hard for the Bulls.  Players such as Tyson Chandler and Jamal Crawford looked promising, but could never seem to reach their maximum effectiveness while in a Bulls uniform. \n The renaissance of the Chicago Bulls began in 2004, when a young man named Luol Deng, a native of Sudan, was drafted and donned the red and white.  Showing flashes of both talent and moodiness, Deng was a rather divisive player. \n Things continued to improve for the Bulls when, in 2007, they drafted Joakim Noah from the University of Florida, who had helped his college team win two consecutive national titles.  Noah would grow into a defensive force capable of contributing on offense, as well, and would become and emotional leader. \n The Bulls were led by other solid players like Andres Nocioni, Ben Gordon, Kirk Hinrich, and Brad Miller during this time, usually reaching the playoffs, but almost always being defeated in the first round. \n 2008 is when the Bulls' future really began looking bright.  In 2007-2008, the Chicago Bulls had struggled to a 33-49 overall record, preventing them from making the playoffs.  The Bulls would have picked relatively early in the 2008 draft had it not been for the draft lottery.  The Bulls had a less than 2% chance of winning the draft lottery in 2008, but were miraculously granted the number 1 overall pick.  With this pick, they drafted the young Derrick Rose, a point guard from the University of Memphis, and also a Chicago native, brought up during the years of Jordan, Pippen, and Rodman. \n The Bulls have made the playoffs every year since Rose was drafted.  The first two appearances with Rose in a Bulls uniform were promising, but ultimately futile.  In 2009, the Bulls forced the defending champion Boston Celtics to a maximum seven games, including several overtime periods, only to lose game seven.  In 2010, the Bulls were less successful, losing to LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers in five games. \n The 2010-2011 season was different.  Derrick Rose was confident that he could be named the league's Most Valuable Player prior to the season beginning.  Fortunately, he was proven right, and he became the youngest MVP in league history at the age of 22.  The Bulls would advance to the Eastern Conference Finals, the third round of the playoffs, for the first time since 1998, the final year of Jordan and Pippen's partnership.  Unfortunately, the Bulls would again be defeated by LeBron James, who had since joined the Miami Heat with Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh, two other great players. \n The future looks bright for the Chicago Bulls.  Not only do they have the youngest MVP in history, but they have a fantastic fanbase, great supporting players, and a very strong bench that will be instrumental in another deep playoff run that will hopefully lead to their seventh championship. \n Hope this helps!": "nba",

When I first started playing Diablo it was on PC (got it free for pre-ordering a WoW expansion) and the game was rough because you found yourself farming gold to buy the loot you needed, as useful drops were incredibly scarce.

When you complete all 5 bounties in an act, you get a cache full of loot, some of which can be very very good.  Next, there are Nephalem Rifts-- As you complete tasks in Bounties, you will acquire rift keys that open a portal to a special, randomly generated dungeon crawling with baddies.  Your job is to fill up a \"rift meter\" to 100% in order to spawn a rift guardian-- a mob that is between a named elite and a boss in difficulty.

Greater rifts are just like nephalem rifts, only they're timed.  If you complete the rift before time expires, you have the option to progress to the next level of the rift-- if you don't make it in time, you can upgrade a legendary gem that you possess (this is also an option if you make it in time).  Greater rifts are what the competitive players play-- there are infinite numbers of \"Floors\" to the rifts, and the difficulty will scale well past Torment level 6 as you get past floors in the 30's, so it bees incredibly rewarding and challenging.": "PS4",
            "I don't like the use of the word \"deserved\" because it's not like either of our goals were travesties, even if you disagree with the Kane penalty, you have to at least see how it could be given (I personally think it was an obvious foul, but I am admittedly biased).  Both sides easily could have had 1 or 2 more either way at different points in the game that could have made it feel/come out entirely different, and that's before you start getting into yellows that were/weren't given, etc..  What stands out to me is that West Ham went from playing to beat us, which they were doing well, to playing not to lose (for a variety of reasons, I realize).  When you play not to lose, you always run the risk of something like this happening, and it seems like an especially risky proposition when Spurs are playing so well in the last 10' of the game week in and week out.": "soccer",

            "I haven't played it at all on PS3, but I have played every iteration since Modern Warfare and am coming directly from BO2. Here are my impressions: \n I think it looks great. I played some of the campaign last night and it looks amazing. I think the dog stuff is a bit lame, but at least it only plays like that in the missions. Otherwise, the campaign is pretty much on par with what I have come to expect. You're awesome, here's why. These people are bad, here's why. You're the under dog, here's why. Now, go! But that's what I have come to find in most every FPS, really. That said, it's not awful, not great, but does look pretty. \n For the multiplayer though, it's a lot different. I am what I refer to as a \"bulk player.\" What that means is I am typically great at tracking, and once I learn a map I know where most everyone is or will be and I run all over the map and typically have the most combined kills and deaths. I get a lot of kills, but my ratio is probably just a shade over 1.00. It might be a product of not knowing the maps, but I have come to find that I can't do that on Ghosts. I need to be a bit more methodical, and slower. The respawning is very shaky (it starts you right in front of enemies fairly regularly), so you don't feel comfortable coming to life and just running back to where you were before. Honestly, I kind of like the change of pace. It will be a huge learning curve for me, due to my old style, but it is still fun. I also find it harder to see enemies, meaning hiding out or getting around slowly is not the worst strategy. Otherwise, the actual mechanics are very much in line with what you have come to expect. \n I think the biggest change is the multiplayer options though. I have probably 10+ hours in and I am still struggling to figure out how it all works. You unlock squad members, they can all be used by you and they level up independently. It's like working on up to ten prestige modes at a time. However, unlocking a gun for one doesn't give that gun to other people, but the unlockables do carry over. So I am not sure if the end goal is to prestige every guy one time, or if it's to prestige each member multiple times. The other new piece is that you have specific things each couple of weeks to try to accomplish. They are the same stuff you're normally trying to accomplish, but you get more for them during certain times I think. And I think you can do it with more than one member of your squad each two week period, but I am not sure. If this sounds confusing, it's either because A) It is, or B) I am not explaining it well, because I am confused by it. \n At any rate, it is fun and not better or worse than BO2, but it does look prettier.": "PS4",

            "It's hard to classify \"best.\" I think that means you have to quantify their value, which is hard across a RB, WR, S and OLB (I think the consensus here is Hyde, Johnson, Bethea, Lynch, not in that order). \n Stevie Johnson has surpassed what I deemed to be a ceiling for him (at least he's on pace to), so he has been pleasantly surprising. My main issue with calling him our \"Best\" offseason acquisition is that he's very expensive for the time being and the next two seasons, given that he's a third WR. I think he actually becomes our number two or maybe even number one depending on how long we keep Boldin/Crabtree around. So he's definitely value added, it's just right now, he's $3M and the next two years I think he's $6M. That's expensive (and on top of a 4th rounder). Don't get me wrong, I think he was worth it, and will be even more worth it going forward, but still it's not some bargain. \n Lynch cost just a fifth round pick and we are paying him nothing for the next four years (relatively speaking). Now is too early to tell, and he's going to be slated for a backup role for a while unless something bad happens (which is conceivable seeing as how Bowman's injury and Aldon can't stay out of trouble). But I think everyone has been shocked by this. \n Hyde cost us a second rounder, so he's costing us a little under a million a year. And he's clearly the front-runner for the future Gore throne vacancy. So he's got a very good argument there. We might have a premier back for the next four years that is starting as early as next year (but I am not so quick to write off Gore if nothing more than he's been the face of our franchise for a majority of my memorable fandom), all for pennies on the dollar. \n And lastly, Bethea's argument: When we signed him I was actually a bit bummed because I wanted Byrd (purely because he was widely considered the best safety available and I want a championship NOW). But the more I learned about Bethea, and now that I have really gotten to see him play... He's been remarkable. And initially you could tell he was learning the system, so all of this is on limited experience and he can only get better from here. I don't know that he will play out of his mind all year, but the fact is we are paying him top 18 safety money and he's giving us top five production. Even if he slips to top ten production, he's still a bargain for years to come. \n So, if I have to rank these, based on \"best offseason acquisition,\" in my eyes I would want to balance current chances of winning and future build in this equation, along with value. \n I think of these four, I would rank them: \n 4: Lynch - He's looking great so far, but it's too early to tell. It's great that he's cheap, but how valuable will he be when Bowman and Smith return? That's the question. Excited to see him develop. \n 3: Johnson - He's been huge so far. But he's also very expensive and is going to cost us not only our 4th rounder, but also we're paying him as a top 16 WR, and he's third on our team... That's not a knock on his contribution to our team, he will be huge and if Crabtree or Boldin go down, he can fill in nicely which is a large upgrade to the fucking Jenkins/Baldwin disappointment sandwich we were dealing with last season. Plus, having Lloyd who was said to be in direct competition with Stevie for #3 devalues him just a little bit. \n 2: Hyde - If he is what we think/hope he is, this could be huge and lock our RB spot down for another 6-8 years. It's way early to crown him, but he looks strong and we are definitely a running team. He helps us a bit now, and very likely he helps us more than any of these four in the future. \n 1: Bethea - Never thought I would have said this four weeks ago, that's for sure. But if we have someone who is a plug and play and is already a top-five safety for 18th highest safety money, he's helping us win now, and in the future. I was very concerned about our secondary, and still am. But I no longer concern myself with this position, and I don't think the 49ers are either.": "49ers",

I'd take one guy and roll with them and in the event of a bye, just cut them.

            "I have to say I've been lurking on here quite a bit because I've been itching to get back on the ice for so long, and this past week I was finally able to. I spent a lot of time recovering from some injuries and trying to get back into hockey after some financial issues hit me as well, and I can't tell you guys (and girls) how awesome it feels. Big thanks to everyone here, new and vet, for all the posts you make about your stories, how you overcome different obstacles, and how you find a way to play with sacrifices we all have to make. \n As for the game, I think I did alright. I've been playing since I can remember, but being on hiatus for about a year and a half is the longest I've ever gone. After trying to sub on my old team this spring, I finally got a call up for an open spot. Show up after having only skated twice recently to get used to my skates again and grabbed a teammate of mine to practice some passing in what few minutes we had before puck drop. \n I could tell I felt uncomfortable with the puck. My hands aren't as quick as they used to be, but I know in time I'll get there. This game was going to be mostly about remembering my positioning (I played LW though I usually play D) and trying to be an asset to my team whether or not I could get some scoring going. All in all, I think I did well. The first period was where I had a few good chances. Hit the post a couple times, but that's better than I expected. Second period I got myself a breakaway by blocking a shot and chasing it after it went off of my shinpads, but I ultimately messed that up by not selling my fake well enough. Third period is when I was hot. Working out has done me some good, though nothing really prepares you for playing a game with only 3 others on the bench. I played my position well and crashed the far post on a 2-on-2 rush so that when my center put a shot on net and the rebound came out, I was there to drive it in. That solidified our lead, but with a minute and a half left we were on the PK (Yes! My specialty!).

I really wasn't told much about them, even by my doctor, after both concussions that left me unconscious.

            "The glory of living in 2015 is the existence of all kinds of stats that go beyond simple ERA. Most people have probably noticed that Jon Lester, the 150 million dollar man, hasn't exactly lit the world on fire in his first two starts. \n Aside from some difficulties with the 60-foot throw from the mound to first base, Lester's posted a less-than-stellar 7.84 ERA in two starts, leaving some fans... uneasy. Most understand that it's been two starts and he'll get better, but some advanced stats indicate that he doesn't even really  need  to get better. Just less unlucky. \n \n According to FanGraphs, Lester's been the victim of a .498 Batting Average on Balls In Play ([BABIP]( which generally hovers around .300. Fangraphs explains that BABIP is largely out of a pitcher's control, so it's a decent measure of a pitcher's luck. By BABIP, Lester has been the 2nd-unluckiest pitcher in baseball through two starts. \n \n To take luck out of the equation, we use Fielding Independent Pitching ( FIP . For comparison's sake, Lester's lowest season FIP is 2.78 in 2014, which was 8th in all of baseball. Last season's league leader in FIP was Clayton Kershaw at 1.81. \n \n that FIP is probably unsustainable. Why? because he hasn't given up a home run yet, which makes sense because both of his starts have been in Wrigley, which is difficult to homer out of when the weather is colder. [xFIP]( basically takes FIP and standardizes the rate at which a fly ball will be a home run, which makes it a better indicator of future performance than FIP. Lester's 2015 xFIP is 2.38, essentially predicting that based on his performance so far if his HR/Fly ball rate is league-average, his rest-of-season ERA should be 2.38. He currently ranks 10th in baseball in xFIP. \n \n FIP (and xFIP) indicate that not only has Lester not been bad, he's actually been pretty good. Better-than-last-year's-MVP good. FanGraphs gives him an fWAR of 0.4 so far this season (Baseball-Reference doesn't do WAR this early in a season). Your typical front-line starter will start 33 games in a season barring injury (and Lester has started at least 31 games every year since 2008), and his fWAR extrapolated over 33 starts would give him a 6.6, which would have been good for 3rd best among pitchers in 2014.

To compare, Fancy had won his first three games by an average of 36 points. Adeam came to play though, and going with the bold strategy of starting two TEs worked, as Larry Donnell and Travis Kelce combined for four TDs and 46.3 fantasy points. Big games from Kelvin Benjamin, Frank Gore, and Antonio Brown helped as well, versus huge games from Jordy Nelson and Steve Smith, who scored a combined 57.2 points. Fancy had trouble with the TE slot; with Julius Thomas on bye, Fancy was forced into starting Brent Celek, who put up a goose egg. A failure to start Eddie Royal instead of Keenan Allen cost him 6.5 points, but the game-deciding mistake came from Adeam. Rather than starting Joe \u201cElite\u201d Flacco against a horrid Carolina defense, Adeam opted for Nick Foles against San Francisco. Foles threw two picks en route to just 3.9 points, while Flacco exploded for 25 and Fancy squeaked out the victory, 154.52-151.88. \n Runner Up: Week 8: Password is Taco vs Coach Catterson \n We weren\u2019t expecting a classic when these two met, as Coach Catterson was riding a 6-1 record and was second in the league in points scored. Password is Taco (1-6) was coming off a 36 point pounding against Fancy and was third-worst in the league in points scored. Taco got up for this game though, and behind Drew Brees (25.04), Randall Cobb (21.1), and Larry Fitzgerald (25.5), Taco put up his best point total of the season. Catterson matched him every step of the way though, posting big points from Aaron Rodgers (24.82) and Jeremy Maclin (36.7). Both teams managed their teams incredibly well, exceeding 94% efficiency. Unfortunately, Taco was hit with a Brian Quick injury on the Rams\u2019 third possession of the game, limiting him to just 1.5 points. Catterson suffered no such bad luck, posting an insane efficiency rating of 99.3% compared to Taco\u2019s 94.5%, and Catterson walked away with a 122.82-121.44 victory. The game was the 4th-closest score line of the season. Taco posted his best score of the season and the league\u2019s 5th-best losing score line of the year. \n Worst Game: Week 2: Adeam the Dream vs Steamy Ray Vaughn \n There\u2019s no runner up. There\u2019s no competition. This game was terrible. Adeam got a grand total of 5.4 points from Chris Johnson, Knowshon Moreno, Michael Floyd, and Jordan Cameron, leaving Jeremy Hill\u2019s 16.6 points and Larry Donnell\u2019s 11.6 on the bench. Adeam posted an abysmal efficiency rating of 63.5%. The only thing that went right for him this week was the he got to play Steamy, who was even worse with a 45.6% efficiency rating. Steamy opted to leave Jay Cutler and Brandon Marshall\u2019s 50.84 points on the bench instead of Robert Griffin and Marquise Lee\u2019s 5.82. Adeam\u2019s winning score was by far the worst winning score of the season. The gap between this score and the 2nd score was bigger than the gap from 2-8.

Second in the league in points for and a league-leading All-Play percentage of .797 (next closest at .699), Teamwork would seem to have a legitimate shot to win the title\u2026if he made the playoffs. But alas, an 0-2 start despite averaging 105 ppg combined with 2/3 of the league\u2019s best losing scores. In fact, Teamwork averaged 113 points per game IN LOSSES alone, which would\u2019ve ranked 3rd by itself.

            "Alright, OP. Let's do this ELI5 style. \n Let's say you, Bob, Sally, Jim, and I all have $10. \n The $10 we have is printed on paper. That printed paper isn't inherently valuable, so we have to establish a way of making that printed paper mean something. We used to this based on gold (called the \"Gold Standard\"), but that has long since passed. The value of this dollar is based on a variety of things these days including exchange rates, foreign demand for money, etc. It's rather complicated, but for the sake of simplicity, we shall say the the dollar is currently equal to x. Got it? Good. \n So you, Bob, Sally, Jim and I have $10 each. This means we have 10x each. We have $50 and 50x total. \n Now, the government steps in. In the US, the Federal Reserve in conjunction with the US Mint establish and release money to the public.  Let's say the government goes ahead and orders more money to be printed. Great! Everybody collects $10! \n The five of us now have $20 each for a total of $100. Let's all go to the bar and celebrate our free money! \n Just hold on one minute though! The government may have the ability to order more money to be printed, but  they cannot change the inherent value of the dollar based on current standards . This is extremely simplified, but we'll go with it for now. \n So now let's look at the situation. The five of us have $20 each for a total of $100. This $100 is worth 50x. This means that our dollars don't go as far as they used to! If we go the bar, the pint of beer that used to cost $4 is now going to have to cost $8 to bring in the same amount of money that it did before the value of the dollar was inflated. \n Cool, now we understand inflation and why it sucks, let's move on to your next dilemma. \n Why can't the government print more money to pay of its own debts? Simple. It would cause massive amounts of inflation and would totally mess up the economy. The government owes its money to many many many many businesses and foreign governments. Even though the government would just be printing the money for one entity (itself), that money is still going into other hands and out into the open economy. It's like the example I just provided, but instead of the government directly giving money to people, it's going through other businesses and other governments first before it gets into the hands of the people. Once it's out of out government's hands, it has caused inflation. \n Here's another good example. Let's say I have to pay my credit card bill ($1000) and I decide to pay it with counterfeit money. I could print out 10 fake $100 bills at home if I wanted to. In essence, I would have $1000 of \"money\". As far as credits (what I give) and debits (what I get), I've broken even. Now, if I go to the bank with that money and pay my bill (just assume the bank teller is a moron), I'm debt free. That's great and all for me, but the money I paid for has no inherent value. It's paper that was just printed off to act like cash money. \n In the long run, that's a drop in the bucket of the economy and won't make a big difference, but imagine if millions of people started doing this left and right. The country would be flooded with money that came out of nowhere. This money has nothing to back it up because the value of the dollar is based around factors that involve money that was legitimately printed and authorized to even exist. \n I hope this clarified things a bit!": "explainlikeimfive",

            "Yeah.  The Wind Ensemble's role in the 21st century probably merits another topic to itself, but here goes my brief diatribe: \n A large percentage of band works are didactic--meant to be played by developing ensembles.  This field has experienced tremendous growth over the last 60 or so years because of an influx of high school and collegiate band programs in the US.  There are a number of composers that make their living composing for these \"developing\" ensembles. \n On the other hand, however, there are also a fair amount of highly qualified \"near professional-caliber\" to professional-caliber wind ensembles in existence.  The rise of the premier collegiate wind ensemble has given a new generation of composers a medium.  Composers are now, like never before, are able to pour their creative outputs into works for the wind ensemble medium to be performed by semi-professional and elite college ensembles (UNT, Eastman, Northwestern, etc, etc, etc). \n Unlike professional orchestras, these college ensembles often have a generous supply of rehearsal time to perfect performances.  A good college wind ensemble will usually give between 2-3 full concerts per semester, as oppose to a concert every 1-2 weeks for professional orchestras. \n Also, the Wind Ensemble genre is, at least now, largely academic.  This allows for more experimentation within compositions.  Professional orchestras hold the responsibility of bringing in revenue for each concert--commissioning new works is often a risky endeavor.  Although there is still some risk for college wind ensembles, it is generally an ensemble that is less dependent on ticket sales.  The translation is more experimentation and more commissions. \n There is good money in writing works for \"developing\" ensembles.  I can't fault composers for wanting to put food on their table.  As consumers we have to try to differentiate between a composer's \"Heart\" music and his/her \"Wallet\" music (not that there must always be a difference ...).  That said, I think the best modern wind ensemble works stand right alongside the best modern works for orchestra (or other premiere ensembles).": "classicalmusic",

When it comes down to it, pundit posturing doesn't matter.  The 'Phins, Eagles, and Bills might be winning the ESPN game, but who knows what happens on the field this year. \n We were NFCS champions last year as we were the year before that, despite getting worse from '13 to '14.

Sean Gilbert was a big-name player when we traded two (2) first rounders for him and made him the then highest-paid defensive player in the NFL.  Keyshawn Johnson was a big-name player when we gave him a 4-year $19 mil contract. \n The point is, nobody will know for sure until the season's over.

            "Note: I want to do a weekly WR analysis post, so if anyone has any suggestions for the WR let me know! For example, this Keenan Allen post was asked by /u/dicksilhouette \n **[HERE IS THE FULL VERSION WITH INTEGRATED GIFS!]( \n After a breakout rookie season, the 3rd round rookie from Cal-Berkeley, has had an unspectacular start to his sophomore year. So what happened? Why did this rising star suddenly stop being as productive as many predicted he would be in his second year in the NFL? This post will help answer those questions. \n \n Week 1 vs. Cardinals \n With much hope surrounding Allen and the Chargers, San Diego faced the Cardinals, a top defensive unit in the NFL. Week 1 was going to be a good test for the wide receiver to prove he was NFL caliber, but unfortunately Allen failed to make an impact on his 9 targets, only catching 5 of them for 37 yards. \n One reason for this lack of impact was that Allen routinely lined up against star cornerback Patrick Peterson. Let\u2019s take a look at some of his plays: \n \n [Play 1]( \n \n This is a simple drag route run by Allen over the middle. Peterson is playing man coverage over the top of him and he gets tackled for a minimal gain by the inside linebacker playing zone over the middle. \n \n [Play 2]( \n \n Rivers decides to test Peterson a simple go-route from the right outside. Peterson makes a great swipe on the ball to stop the long completion. As you notice, Peterson plays this man coverage assignment to perfection and is with Allen stride for stride not allowing any seperation on the deep pass. \n \n [Play 3]( \n \n Allen lines up on the left outside facing Cromartie in man coverage. Allen uses his large body to make a short catch on an in-route for a short gain. \n This seemed to be the flavor of the day for Allen. Out of his 9 targets, only Play 2 (above) was the longest attempt all game and the other 8 of his targets were short passes over the middle for less than 10 yards in the air, while the Cardinals defense made solid tackles and didn't allow any big gains by him. In plays where he wasn't targeted it just seemed like he didn't get any separation for Rivers to see him open. \n \n Week 2 vs Seahawks \n Chargers faced the Seahawks at home in Week 2. This is another top defensive unit that Allen would have to face. On 6 targets Allen caught 5 passes for 55 yards. Failing again to make a significant impact in San Diego's win. One cause of this was Rivers' targetting TE Gates who caught 7 passes on 7 targets for 96 yards and 3 touchdowns. Let's look at how Allen performed with some plays. \n Now what caused this lack of serious production for a second week? Richard Sherman was the main cause. Allen line up on the right outside throughout the game. \n \n [Play 1]( \n \n Rivers hits Allen over the middle off of a drag route from the right outside. \n \n [Play 2]( \n \n Allen runs a curl route against Sherman on the right outside. Allen's route running and quick turn on the curl turns around Sherman getting the Chargers the first down. \n \n [Play 3]( \n \n Allen runs another curl route to get a first down on Sherman from the right outside. He sits in the area between the inside linebacker's zone and Shermans deep zone on the cover 3. \n \n [Play 4]( \n \n Here is the only deep pass targeted to Allen all game. In this play he runs a simple go route to the inside of the CB Maxwell. Maxwell has great man-to-man coverage on him on this play and the pass ends up sailing high on Rivers so Allen couldn't make a play on the ball. \n This is the second game in a row where Rivers threw deep to Floyd and Gates but mainly gave Allen curl and drag routes over the middle. Sherman covered Allen well most of the game, and Maxwell did a good job when he lined up on the left side of the offensive line. \n \n Week 3 vs Bills \n During the week it was announced that Allen suffered a minor groin injury, but he still suited up for the game versus the Bills. He was only targeted twice although he played 67 of the 69 offensive snaps. He hauled in both targets for a total of 27 yards. \n \n [Play 1]( \n \n Allen lines up on the right outside and runs a slant route. He stumbles a little bit and turns to make his way back outside for his QB to find him as an easy checkdown good for the first down. \n \n [Play 2]( \n \n Allen runs an out route from the slot and turns the cornerback around on his cut. \n \n [Play 3]( \n \n Here is a view of Rivers when he released the ball. Allen is wide open on the sideline running a go route but Royal was targeted in double coverage over the middle instead. [IMG]( \n Now this is interesting. In his previous two matches he was targeted on 25% of Rivers passes but in this game he was only targeted 8% of the Rivers 25 passes. Simply put, in this game Allen didn't get looks even on multiple deep routes that he could have made a play on. Rivers opted to go short or with a different receiver instead against Buffalo. \n \n Week 4 vs Jaguars \n After another week of healing time and coming off of a lack of targets, the Jaguars defense looked like an ideal matchup for the Chargers' 2nd year wide receiver. In the previous three matches, the Jaguars defense allowed a total of 119 points (39.7 pts/game) and 1,398 yards (466 yds/game). Allen needed a breakout week against this inferior defensive unit in order to prove his rookie season was not a fluke. Well against the Jaguars, he performed to the tune of 10 receptions for 135 yards on 12 targets. Here are some of his plays: \n \n [Play 1]( \n \n Allen runs a deep in route into the zone coverage played by the Jaguars. There was a clear mistake committed by the cornerback covering Allen on the outside. Instead of following Allen to the left hashes he continues on following the go route run by Floyd leaving Allen wide open. \n \n [Play 2]( \n \n This is another play designed to defeat the zone coverage by the Jaguars. The secondary was in a cover 2 with 5 underneath zones over the middle. Allen turns his deep in just past the underneath zones and below the safeties sitting over top. \n \n [Play 3]( \n \n This is one of my favorite plays made by Allen thus far. He runs a curl route from the outside left. The Jaguars secondary is playing a cover 3 with four zones underneath. The cornerback lining against Allen goes to the deep zone, while the nickle cornerback goes into the underneath zone on the outside and the inside linebacker drops into the inside zone. \n Allen finds the hole between these three zones pictured below and then makes a strong effort to come back to the ball getting the reception and avoiding an interception. [IMG]( \n Against the Jaguars, Allen played phenomenally constantly beating coverage and gaining separation on drag routes, curls and deep in routes. \n \n Week 5 vs Jets \n Coming off a great performance against the Jaguars, Allen was once again targeted a team high with 7 targets. Unfortunately he only converted three receptions for 25 yards. Out of his receptions all three were for short gains. The Chargers attempted to go deep with Allen twice, but one was overthrown and the other was intercepted on a great play by the defender (See Play 2). \n \n [Play 1]( \n \n Allen lines up on the outside left directly against Jets cornerback Walls who is playing off man coverage. He runs an out route underneath the coverage for an 11 yard gain. \n \n [Play 2]( \n \n Allen lines up on the outside left and runs a hitch and go. He goes up for the ball, but the Jets cornerback Adams makes a great play on the ball and comes away with the interception. \n \n [Play 3a]( \n \n Allen lines up against Millner on the play. Allen runs a go route and Millner stays with him. By the time the ball arrives Millner hasn't turned yet, but Allen locates it and attempts to grab it. He unfortunately can't bring it in for the reception. \n Here is the play from the broadcast as Allen can't haul in the reception. [Play 3b]( \n It seems like against the Jets, Rivers opted to go deep with Floyd and Royal instead of Allen relying on them to make the bigger plays whereas Allen was kept to shorter passes and quick routes that didn't net him many yards. It was a great game overall for Rivers and the Chargers, but Allen didn't really contribute to the win as much as one would expect when the team wins 31-0. In this game, Allen was beaten by good coverage overall by the Jets in man coverage not allowing him to gain any serious separation. \n \n Week 6 vs Raiders \n This game was a shootout by Rivers and Raiders' quarterback Derek Carr. In this game Allen had 3 receptions on 6 targets for 27 yards. He was third on the team for targets behind Gates and Floyd with 8 and 7, respectively. In this game, Floyd led the team with 103 yards and a touchdown. \n \n [Play 1]( \n \n Allen runs an out-and-up route on the right side of the offensive line. The Raiders cornerback Carrie in man coverage stays with him stride for stride and doesn't allow him to come back to the ball. \n \n [Play 2]( \n \n Lining up in the outside right, Allen ran a go route into the outside cornerback who was playing one of the deep cover 3 zones. Rivers through the ball inside of Allen and seemed upset after the play. I expect he thought Allen was going to run a post route to the middle of the field since there was space underneath the deep zones. \n \n [Play 3]( \n \n Allen runs a drag route over the middle for a 5 yard gain. Like in his other games the drag routes and the curl routes seem to be the go-to routes, while he gets covered pretty well on most of his deeper routes and even on the times when he gets open Rivers is already looking the other way.": "Chargers",
            "If Shanahan doesn't go, a switch back to the 4-3 actually helps the Redskins since most of their personnel are geared towards it anyway. \n I disagree with this. One of Orakpo's biggest strengths this year has been an improved pass coverage in the flat and all around has been a very solid ROLB. His pass rush is solid, but unspectacular so you wouldn't be able to use his other skills that he has developed over the past 3 seasons. Putting his hand in the dirt won't magically increase his sack totals. Also, Kerrigan looks pretty good too at making open field tackles this season and not getting blown by the run. \n Cofield is an amazing NT. Most NTs just eat up two blockers and commit to run support, but Cofield does this and gets a good pass rush from the middle. Also, Carriker would be gone too as he was awful in the 4-3 for the Rams. He's a good 3-4DE when healthy (next season I guess). Correct me if I'm wrong, but Bowen was a DE for the Cowboys not a DT, so I don't think he would be nearly as effective. \n The 4-3 is way more bland defense and you need corners and safeties that play their roles and can tackle as it's a lot harder to disguise blitzes and coverages to confuse QBs and it's more difficult to stop RBs once they break past the dline. We simply do not have the talent in the secondary for this or have OLB's that would translate to it so we would have to rebuild. Also, Jenkins and Nield wouldn't fit either so some of our depth players would be gone too.": "Redskins",

You win games. If a coach doesn't trust you then you won't get playing time. Shanahan doesn't like Fred Davis because of his lack of work ethic. This proves it and is the reason why he isn't getting playing time or helping his team win more games. \n Fred Davis has the talent to play pretty much for any team in the NFL, but he never got his shit together which is why he fell out of favor with the team. \n Edit:": "nfl",

Titans might get a 6th round pick not a 4th round pick for Britt at best. \n >  Bengals get QB Josh Freeman; Buccaneers get a 4th-rd pick \n This is just laughable. a 4th round pick?

Isaiah Pead hasn't shown anything yet. \n >  Lions get WR Josh Gordon; Browns get RB Mikel Leshoure \n Browns will never trade one of their few bright spots away for a 3rd string backup. Browns maybe have done some fishy things in the past, but this will never happen. \n >  Eagles get RB Maurice Jones-Drew; Jaguars get QB Nick Foles \n Only  decent  trade on this list.

Hakeem Nicks is still worth way more than Jonathan Stewart. \n >  Cowboys get S Jairus Byrd & RB Fred Jackson; Bills get TE Gavin Escobar \n Most laughable trade on the list. Jairus Byrd is a pro-bowl FS. Fred Jackson is a great backup RB for a running back that constantly gets beaten up.

You'll certainly be grabbing a bunch of RBs late in the rounds for Kyle to play the dice with, but I expect great things.": "Browns",
            "CONTINUATION OF OP. PLEASE UPVOTE FOR VISIBILITY \n \n Play 24 \n [GIF]( \n RG3 in I-formation has two outside WRs Jackson and Garcon on opposite sides. The offensive line does a great job of clearing the pocket leaving the entire right side of the field open. RG3 scrambles to the right after escaping the pocket for a 6 yard gain. Garcon was open on the far left sideline but by the way the pass rushers attacked the pocket, RG3 would have thrown completely across his body to get to him. \n After RG3 escapes the pocket he easily could have tossed it to Morris over the middle who then could have gotten the same amount of yards or possibly more. The good news is that RG3 makes the decision quickly and gets out of bounds avoiding the hit. \n \n Play 25 \n [GIF]( \n RG3 in pistol formation has Garcon and Jackson as the outside wide receivers. RG3 snaps the ball and has a perfectly clean pocket. He holds onto the ball and eventually finds TE Paul in the flat right. DT McDonald comes around on a stunt and hits RG3 hard right after he throws the ball. RG3 can't get enough velocity on the ball so it hits the dirt before Paul. \n This was an infuriating play. RG3 has a perfectly clean pocket and can't make the most of it. Jackson and Garcon BOTH get wide open yet RG3 doesn't see them and he decides to scramble to the outside. This play should have been a 25 yard gain by any competent college QB, but RG3 decides to hold onto the ball too long causing the incompletion and gets destroyed in the process. \n [Play Breakdown]( \n \n Play 26 \n [GIF]( \n RG3 in shotgun has trips left with Jackson, Garcon and Roberts. Reed is by himself on the right side. Jackson runs a go-route from the middle of the trips formation and beats his CB easily. RG3 steps up into the pocket and throws it just past a wide-open Jackson. RG3's deep ball coming out of college was one of the things that he was touted on, so to see him missing two wide-open passes by a mere yard or two was excruciating. \n \n Play 27 \n [GIF]( \n RG3 in pistol has Jackson and Roberts on the right and Garcon on the left. Jackson runs a quick hitch route into zone coverage and is open on the right side almost immediately. After the snap LT Moses lets his pass rusher beat him to the inside, but he is able to box him out of the play for RG3 to buy some time. RG3 thinks about scrambling through the middle, but decides at the last minute to jump pass the ball to Jackson. Jackson gets crushed shortly after catching the ball. Give him credit for holding onto the ball. \n \n Play 28 \n [GIF]( \n [GIF]( \n Sack Alert! RG3 in shotgun has trips left with Jackson, Garcon and Roberts. Reed is by himself on the right side. RG3 snaps the ball and steps up into the pocket. RT Compton gets beaten to the inside causing RG3 to step backwards into DE Johnson who beats LT Moses on the other side. To blame for this sack is LT Moses for giving up on his blocking assignment and RG3 for not seeing Jackson wide open on the go route or Roberts in the seam. \n After the sack, the Redskins are in the same spot as they were after play 16. Forbath has roughly a 50 yard kick and he misses it yet again right. The game would have been tied 13-13 if Forbath could have made both of his field goals. The Buccaneers get the ball back and quickly throw a long 36 yard pass to Evans who burns the Redskins secondary making it 20-7 after the extra point is made. \n \n Play 29 \n [GIF]( \n RG3 fumbles the low snap and is able to get rid of it in time to Morris before he gets taken down. Unfortunately Morris can't hold onto it for the incompletion. \n \n Play 30 \n [GIF]( \n RG3 in shotgun snaps the ball and watches LG Lauvao instantly getting beaten to the inside. RG3 avoids the incoming DT, steps up into the pocket and throws the ball to Roberts for the quick completion over the middle. This is a great play RG3. The LG would have been totally responsible for the quick sack, but RG3 is able to turn it into a positive gain with his elusiveness. \n \n Play 31 \n [GIF]( \n RG3 in shotgun has Garcon and Roberts on the right and Jackson on the left. RT Compton gets beaten inside by the DE, so RG3 has to scramble outside of the pocket. RG3 scans the field and has no one open so he throws it out of bounds wisely avoiding getting hit. His first read was Jackson on the left running the slant route, but the ROLB was in his throwing zone. \n \n Play 32 \n [GIF]( \n RG3 in shotgun has Jackson and Roberts on the right and Garcon on the left. RG3 takes the snap, scans the field and notices the LG Lauvao gets beaten on his outside shoulder. RG3 avoids the sack and scrambles to the left. He runs out of bounds avoiding the hit. If you notice TE Paul was actually wide-open on the right side after he released from the line, but since the pressure was coming from the left side and since RG3 started his reads on that side he doesn't ever see him. \n Redskins punt the ball after this play. The Buccaneers receive the ball back at their own 20 yard line after the punt. A few quick plays and then a 56 yard bomb to WR Evans puts the Buccaneers ahead 27-7. \n \n Play 33 \n [GIF]( \n RG3 in shotgun has Jackson and Roberts on the right and Garcon on the left. RG3 snaps the ball and sees all of his receivers are actually covered well except for Morris how was releasing from the backfield. Morris catches the ball and gains 12 yards on the play. Good quick decision making by RG3. \n Watch Jackson at the far right side. He gets shoved right in the face with a referee watching and no flag is thrown. That should have been a personal foul. \n \n Play 34 \n [GIF]( \n [GIF]( \n Sack Alert! RG3 in shotgun has Jackson and Roberts on the right and Garcon on the left. Garcon runs a quick in-route over the middle and is wide-open. RG3 steps up into the pocket and shortly therefafter gets sacked. It looks like RG3 saw Garcon after the snap and his initial contact with the CB concluding he wasn't open so he went onto TE Paul. RG3 needs to get better at not waiting for his WR to be wide-open to throw the ball. He should have anticipated that Garcon's route would have taken him to the center of the field. \n [Play Breakdown]( \n Play 35 \n [GIF]( \n RG3 in shotgun throws a quick WR screen pass to Jackson. He throws it too low and the play is incomplete from the start. Terrible pass by RG3. Watch RT Compton. He gets beaten immediately to the inside. His role even on this screen pass is still to set up the throwing lanes. Frankly, this is probably why RG3 rushed the throw. \n \n Play 36 \n [GIF]( \n RG3 in shotgun has trips right and Reed by himself on the left. RG3 snaps the ball and starts to scan the field. There is already pressure in his face, so he dumps the ball off to Helu over the middle. From four pass rushers, there is way too much pressure on this offensive line. \n \n Play 37 \n [GIF]( \n RG3 in shotgun has trips left and Garcon by himself on the right. The Buccaneers have zone coerage over the middle, so initally the routes appear to be covered. RG3 steps up into the pocket and realizes there is open ground between him and the linebackers so he takes off. This is the only time today where I wish he took more precaution and went to the ground. Every single time before this he avoided the hit, but this time it looks like rookie, reckless RG3 again. A very disconcerting thing to see as he only had to get to the 41 yardline for the first down. \n \n Play 38 \n [GIF]( \n [GIF]( \n Sack Alert! RG3 has trips right and Reed by himself on the left. Buccaneers bring 5 pass rushers and that's way too much for the Redskins porous offensive line. Reed is open off of the snap immediately running a slant route, but even before his break on one of the shortest WR routes in existance there is already pressure in RG3's face. DE56 is the free rusher and gets the sack as RT Compton picks up CB29 instead. \n [Play Breakdown]( \n \n Play 39 \n [GIF]( \n HB screen pass to Helu. Great play by the defensive line closing down the running lanes and stopping it for a loss. \n \n Play 40 \n [GIF]( \n RG3 has trips right and Reed by himself on the left. Buccaneers are playing deep Cover 2 with 5 underneath zones. RG3 sees this and immediately dumps the ball to Helu who gets 7 of the necessary 24 yards for the first down. Redskins punt the ball and McCown leads a 7 minute drive back to the middle of the field. At this point, Jay Gruden decides to just run the ball a few times and throw a couple of quick design passes to the RBs to end the game.": "Redskins",
            "Edit: I wrote this in the time that Haslett wasn't confirmed for DC, but it still is an interesting comparison between the two. \n I wanted to do an investigation into how the Redskins would look with Wade Phillips as DC and see if he would be a good fit: \n First off, many will astutely point out that Wade Phillips also runs a 3-4 defense. But his defense is actually quite different than ours. \n Defensive Lineman \n Wade Phillips runs a 1 gap 3-4 scheme, whereas Jim Haslett runs a more traditional 2 gap scheme. In a traditional 2 gap scheme the NT and DE's will read their respective holes and react to the play as the play begins. This read-react causes the lineman to have to first think about the action, then react to it. So they have to be larger bodied men to offset the time it takes to react to the play in order to hold your ground so the offensive lineman can't get leverage on you. \n In a 1 gap system like WP's, the d-lineman have a pre-determined hole they are going through. They know as soon as the play call begins where they will pounce. A one gap lineman can therefore be smaller and quicker. This holds true for WP in Houston whose NT is Earl Mitchell who plays at 6-3 300 lbs. In a traditional 2 gap, the NT is more like your Casey Hampton or Vince Wilfork who is 6-2 325 lbs. This bodes very well for Cofield who is 6-4 318 lbs but definitely plays quicker on his feet than his weight indicates. \n The defensive ends are similar to the NT where they only have responsibility for one gap. Houston's current DE's are JJ Watt and Antonio Smith who both play around 290 lbs. These are surprisingly small lineman for a 3-4, and the reason comes down to his desire for quickness off the snap to shoot through a pre-determined hole. A person like Stephon Tuitt from Notre Dame would be an IDEAL fit for his system at DE. \n Linebackers \n The lineman play the one gap and the inside linebackers goal is to cover the run in the A and B gaps. The weak ILB typically has more pass coverage duties than the strong ILB. Both ILBs cover the run. The strong ILB blitzes a fair amount so an ILB that can blitz like Daryl Washington in Arizona would be a great fit here. \n The weak OLB is where WP's system gets interesting. In Dallas, WP used Ware to line up as a 4th lineman a lot of times to blitz. For coverage he primarily played the flats, and wasn't asked to man cover the running back. This role would be great for Ryan Kerrigan as his best trait is blitzing, and isn't the strongest in coverage. Rob Jackson and Orakpo could be the strong OLB and Kerrigan and Jenkins could play weak OLB to blitz the passer. \n Secondary \n The secondary varies from what we do in Washington. In Washington we ask our guys to play zone a lot and have them watch the QBs for possible takeaways. In WP's system the corners play bump-and-run and press coverage a lot more. The strong safety shifts to the center of the field to fill in for the blitzing strong inside linebacker and the free safety plays more man/zone coverage over the top. \n I'm a little bit worried for the secondary if we brought on WP since it requires CBs that can tackle. We don't have sure tackling CBs or S's so this would be even more called out upon in WPs system since you don't have a second ILB covering the run nearly as much as we do now, since WP had the Strong safety taking a lot of these duties across the middle. If we had WP we could still sign someone like Talib who is agressive or even a sure-tackling safety like Byrd if that is what management wants more. \n Interesting addition \n WP doesn't play 3-4 all the time. He really only plays it on 1st and 2nd down. On 3rd downs he swaps out his DE's, and puts his OLBs in for them, and puts a 2nd DT on the field with nickle coverage over the top in a 4-2-5. This is mainly because the 3rd down is for obvious passing downs. This adds another dimmension to the game and we could bust out our Nascar package with Orakpo, Kerrigan and Jenkins fighting for sacks. \n Conclusion \n I'm all onboard for WP to take over as DC. He has proven with a lot top 10 defenses in his career that he is a great DC, just not a good HC. Our front seven would be greatly improved with this formation change, since ILBs would not be as big of a weak point for us and it would allow Orakpo to maximize his blitzing strengths and to move around the field to create mismatches. Our secondary would be suspect, but it's not like it isn't already and we would still need definitely improve that and add sure-tackling CBs.": "Redskins"

So this is why I say material and worldly needs are not important. \n As a result, we ask for prayer requests.  We pray for them.  We pray  with  them.  Perhaps more importantly, we ask them to  pray for us .  And when we get to that last point, the descending of God's peace becomes so powerful and overwhelming!

Married life requires so much time and energy--any wife of a pastor could tell you this. \n Instead, I offer this:  Encourage counseling.   Not just in the priesthood, but to everyone.  Mental illness and inner struggles are difficult because it's a matter of with pride, and we all are subject to the whims of our pride.  For those in the priesthood especially, when their pride prevents them from seeking help; when their reputation blinds them to their need for redemption; when their own perceived holiness replaces God's holiness--THIS is when things explode into such terrible ends.

What I've concluded in my humble thought experiments is that humanity was close to God in the beginning and we received the scriptures/teachings from Him.  However, until we developed written language, these teachings were passed down via oral tradition, and sometimes changes were made.

            "If you look at the two verses together: \n \"Death is the wages of sin. Sin separates us from God\" \n > So I guess what I'm asking here is how would someone like me know when the word \"death\" means actual death as we know it, or a spiritual separation, as you describe in your post? \n If you think of death in the physical context, there is a separation. Christians (and many others) believe that we have a soul, and that when the human body stops functioning, the soul leaves the body. They become separated. \n Here is an example in the Bible showing this: \n Ecclesiastes 12:7\nThen the dust will return to the earth as it was, And the spirit will return to God who gave it. \n A good example to show death as separating God from man is in Genesis, at the beginning. Some time after creation, before the fall, God warned man: \n Genesis 2:17\n \"but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat of it you shall surely die.\u201d \n When Adam ate it, he didn't physically die that day, but he did eventually die: \n Genesis 5:5\n So all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty years; and he died. \n On that day in Eden, after Adam sinned, he became separated from God, whereas previously he was in relationship with Him: \n Genesis 3:8-10\n 8 And they heard the sound of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God among the trees of the garden. \n 9 Then the Lord God called to Adam and said to him, \u201cWhere are you?\u201d \n 10 So he said, \u201cI heard Your voice in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked; and I hid myself.\u201d \n To further reinforce this, Adam was sent out of the garden of Eden: \n Genesis 3:23\n therefore the Lord God sent him out of the garden of Eden to till the ground from which he was taken. \n Other instances require reading in context. For example, in these passages, I am sure you realise that it is spiritual death being referred to, not physical: \n Luke 15:24\n for this my son was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.\u2019 And they began to be merry. \n Luke 15:32\n It was right that we should make merry and be glad, for your brother was dead and is alive again, and was lost and is found.\u2019\u201d \n John 5:24\n \u201cMost assuredly, I say to you, he who hears My word and believes in Him who sent Me has everlasting life, and shall not come into judgement, but has passed from death into life. \n Ephesians 2:1\n And you He made alive, who were dead in trespasses and sins \n Another context in which death is used, but again, separation is the key. The Bible talks about a second death - that which happens to those who do not believe in Christ at the judgement: \n Revelation 20:14-15\n 14 Then Death and Hades were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death. \n 15 And anyone not found written in the Book of Life was cast into the lake of fire. \n 2 Thessalonians 1:8-9\n 8 in flaming fire taking vengeance on those who do not know God, and on those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ. \n 9 These shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of His power": "DebateAChristian",

            "5) Morality \n Now let's consider what is probably the crux of your original question. I have covered the other topics to try to give some greater depth to this section. \n You are probably asking why Christians should or should not behave in certain ways. \n Why should a Christian not get drunk? Why should a Christian not have sex outside of marriage? Why should a Christian not be involved with homosexual relationships? Why shouldn't we lie, steal, kill? Why shouldn't we have the freedom to do what we want to do regardless? etc. \n Firstly, let me preface the reason that follow with a quote from Paul: \n Romans 6:14-15: For sin shall not have dominion over you, for you are not under law but under grace . \n In Christ we are free from the law. We are no longer held for the consequences of our actions, because Jesus has taken our punishment on the cross. There is now no requirement, or [condmenation]( regarding our keeping of the law, because it has already been kept for us, and paid for us by Christ. \n So in terms of God's law, we can do as we please and not be condemned. \n Paul does go on though to say this: \n 1 Corinthians 10:23  All things are lawful for me, but not all things are helpful; all things are lawful for me, but not all things edify. \n and \n 1 Corinthians 6:12 All things are lawful for me, but all things are not helpful. All things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any. \n Essentially Paul says here that while he is allowed to do anything he pleases, that some courses of action will not have good results in terms of them not being helpful or positive or letting a sinful thing have power over him. \n Let's examine this a bit further in the context of what we covered previously: \n 1) Funtional stuff, Laws & society. \n It is unwise to behave in ways that are bad for you. Why doesn't God want you to go out and get drunk? Because bad things happen to people when they are drunk. \nWhy doesn't God want you to have sex outside of marriage? You might get an unwanted pregnancy or an STD, but you'll also suffer the emotional consequences of engaging in being bonded to another person and then possibly ripping yourself away again. \nWhy shouldn't we murder people? Because ending a life is massively destructive on so many levels. \n Look at all of the commands and you should be able to work out why they were written. There is a cause and effect for all of these things that end up with negative consequences because of the way the world functionally is. \n You have the freedom to sacrifice you baby with fire to another God, but only bad things will come of it. \n These functional boundaries are for your good anf the good of everyone else in the world. \n If you are wondering about why we should keep some laws and not others, that is another issue, but essentially, Jesus says that if we love Him, we will  keeping His Commandments . \n 2) Decisions & Spiritual Freedom \n Essentially our decisions are massively influenced by our spiritual position. \n The difference between a Christian and a non-Christian is that a person who has truly come to know Christ has received into their body the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit has an effect of influencing every aspect of that believer's life. \n Over time the believer is influenced to do things that are for God's glory and purposes. \n The non-Christian is in a position that is spiritually influenced by Satan. I am not saying that they are off worshipping Satan in the same way Christians worship God, but as I eluded to earlier, his influence is to get people serving themselves, andto keep them away from Christ as much as possible. This influence can take numerous forms from really obviously evil activities like murder and gang rape to really subtle ones like white lies and not doing good where you had opportunity. \n One of the other factors here is that sin keeps us separate from God. Before a person has their sin forgiven and removed from them, they cannot have a relationship with God. Sin acts as a barrier between them. This sin prevents them from actually coming to know Him. This sin is part of why some people are blind to God and others see Him clearly. \n When we become Christians, and there is a situation that we are tempted to sin in, we are 'free' to do so, but if we do it will cause some bad consequences. One of these is placing that barrier back between us and Him. While the barrier of sin here can be removed by true repentance, it does cloud our relationship with Him and affect our further 'decisions'. \n In terms of refining it down to it's essence. When Christians do good, they can do it for God or for Satan. The Non-Christian does not have the freedom to truly do something for God, because they cannot personally know Him, therefore it cannot be counted as an act of worship. \n So in summary , I think you probably have the word freedom confused and probably do not understand what it means in as full a sense as you need to in order to answer your question properly, which is why I have written all of this out.": "ChristianApologetics",

            "But if it isn't inerrant, then how do I know which verses to take literally? \n I'll take it for granted in this discussion that the gospels are at least reliable in how they portray Jesus. Now, these documents often quote the Old Testament in order to show that Jesus fulfilled various prophecies in order to legitimize the claim that he was the Jewish Messiah. Moreover, Jesus often refers to Old Testament texts in his teachings, showing that He at least thought of it as the word of God. \n But when you look at  how  the NT authors quote the Old Testament, then it soon becomes clear that this is often quite figurative and rarely has much to do with the original context - they take a lot of liberty, so to speak. For example, a lot of the prophecies that Jesus is claimed to have fulfilled are, when you look at the original context, not really prophecies at all; someone just reading that text in the Old Testament could never have concluded that it was a prophecy about a future Messiah (this is also one of the reasons I think the gospel accounts are reliable, because it would have made no sense to invent events that would have Jesus fulfill prophecies that aren't that clearly prophecies at  all - a contrived Jesus would have looked quite differently). \n So in my view, Jesus is the definitive revelation of God, and I interpret the rest of the Bible through that lens. Jesus, his message and his life is emphatically  not  just another opinion on God, but Jesus really was God who became a human being on earth. \n The problem is that people approach the Bible either as a recipe cookbook (every book in the Bible equally reflects God, from the massacres commanded in Deuteronomy to the sermon on the Mount in Matthew) or as just a completely subjective collection of opinions of God, which is not any more valuable than the Quran, a science textbook or the gospel of the Flying Spaghetti Monster. \n How we should (IMO) view the Bible is as a story/narrative in which a huge plot twist at the end (Jesus coming to earth, being crucified, and raised from the dead) completely changes how we understood the first 800 pages of the story.": "OpenChristian",

            "Earlier today I was checking out some lines black can play against the mainline Caro-Kann. I ended up discovering a weird sideline that can occur if white isn't careful with his move order and black happens to know about this strange line. \n The starting position of the classical mainline is reached with 1. e4 c6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 dxe4 4. Nxe4 Bf5 5. Ng3 Bg6 6. h4 h6 7. Nf3 Nd7 8. h5 Bh7 9. Bd3 Bxd3 10. Qxd3 at which point black has to decide on how to develop further.

Nc3 dxe4 4. Nxe4 Bf5 5. Ng3 Bg6 6. h4 h6 7. Nf3 Nf6!? (or 7. ..e6!? - either move provokes white to play 8. Ne5 and then black is supposed to be able to take advantage of the forward position of this knight) 8. Ne5 Bh7 9. Bd3! Bxd3 10. Qxd3 Nbd7 11. f4. \n Instead of transposing to this somewhat dubious variation by playing 7. ...h6, however, black can play the strange looking 7. ...Nh5!?. This knight move to the rim has concrete points. Firstly and obviously, it blocks the further advance of the h4-pawn. Secondly, there's the annoying threat of ruining white's pawn structure on the kingside with Nxg3 fxg3. The knight on g3 has only two options - either exchange on h5 (which would lead to a position where black's light-squared bishop is in no danger anymore, and black is perfectly fine) or retreat to e2 (which is not ideal either because it blocks the development of the f1-bishop, and white loses control over the e4-square meaning that 9. g4 and 10. h5 isn't really a threat anymore because black can reply 10. ...Be4). In any case, however white deals with these issues, it seems like black doesn't have too many problems. \n I don't know who first thought of this move, but it has been played at the highest level. Ivanchuk used the move at Wijk aan Zee 2008 against Vishy Anand, who at that point had just become world champion 3 months earlier, and scored a quick and effortless draw. (Game:  The move 7. ...Nh5 apparently made enough of an impression on Anand that he used it a year later himself against GM Mamedov, though he stumbled early in the game (8. ...e6 or 8. ...Nxg3 9. fxg3 e6 and white has no tricks with Bxf7+. Game: \n In any case I can't see anything particularly wrong with the move, plus for many people it will have a nice surprise value. And for people who play the white side of the classical Caro-Kann, it's worth knowing that it matters significantly whether you play 6. h4 first or 6. Nf3 and then 7. h4.": "chess"

He justified himself by claiming he didn't know Andy was depressed and possibly suicidal. \n Would Heywood have been \"wrong\" to  withhold  the rope from Andy because he suspected Andy of having suicidal tendencies,  even if Andy had a right to the rope ? \n What I'm getting at here is that one cannot simply assert the moral goodness of giving things away to strangers if  quite apart from that  we maintain in our minds a list of things that are \"good\" to give to strangers and \"bad\" to give to strangers (or anyone, let's say). \n The life of a parent is (or  ought  to be) one of  total self-giving  (i.e. \"charity\") to one's own children.

And like the judge who pithily proclaimed that he can't give obscenity a definition, but he \"knows it when he sees it\", we can't exactly define what makes those \"wrong\" ways  really wrong  without reference to a \"right way\"--a way that tends towards results that we've determined are \"good\" for  other  reasons. \n Perhaps, though sacrificing their entire lives for the sake of their children, a certain mother and father have  ill prepared  their children to be financially successful.

Phrases like \"die  before  being saved\". \n >Please tell me if I'm asking or wording something strange \n Man is a composite creature, made up of both body (material) and soul (immaterial).  At death, the soul of man is separated from his body.  A  disintegration  occurs.  The  whole  man is no longer present.  Man was  meant  to be a material creature and he will be again at the general resurrection when the  whole  man, body and soul, are reunited in a glorious spiritual but  physical  body. \n But  being  a material creature subjects us to an experience of space/time (or \"spacetime\") that  immaterial  creatures don't necessarily inhabit.  Aquinas saw this when he suggested that our experience of duration (time) is categorically related to, but distinct and different  from , both eternity and aeviternity, aeviternity being the mean or  mid point between the timelessness of eternity and teh succession of moments we call  time , as we (physical material creatures) experience it. \n What is time?  There're a lot of good and maybe even correct answers to that question and many more  incorrect  ones, but perhaps we can say that space is a measure of the distance between points, while time is a measure of the  movement  between points--points themselves as having location in space/time but no measurable quality otherwise. \n So space and time, as we experience it...that is, one moment succeeding another, one  location  succeeding another, where there can be a before and an after and where both past and future are relative to our current moment but neither is really, truly accessible to us from the present...and where choices made in the present, though influenced by our past, can really truly be freely made with their results, their  consequences , clouded in mystery and unknown to us in the present--this is the  time  in which our decisions can shape our destiny.

But the Latin plainly says \"de necessitate salutis,\" meaning \"from the necessity of salvation.\" The word salutis (salvation) is in the genitive case, meaning 'of salvation,' not 'for salvation.' And the preposition 'de' (from) and the grammatical case of 'necessitate' (ablative) cannot be ignored. Neither does the Latin word 'omnino' translate accurately as 'absolutely.' The word 'omnino,' means 'altogether,' and is derived from the word 'omnia,' meaning 'all.' The result is that subjection to the Roman Pontiff is not that type of necessity which is simple and absolute. \n >Baptism, which bestows on us the state of grace, is simply and absolutely necessary for salvation. Repentance from all actual mortal sins prior to death is simply and absolutely necessary for salvation. Dying is a state of grace is simply and absolutely necessary for salvation. But other things that are necessary for salvation are necessary in a secondary manner. For example, a Protestant who rejects the authority of the Pontiff might still be saved, if his sin is reduced in culpability due to ignorance. It is an objective mortal sin to reject the authority of the Roman Pontiff. But this sin might not also be an actual mortal sin, due to reduction in culpability so that it is either an actual venial sin, or not an actual sin at all. \n >Now the words of the Fifth Lateran Council, prove that the translation \"from the necessity of salvation\" is correct. For the Council used a different wording to repeat and to clarify the teaching of Unam Sanctam. \n >  **Fifth Lateran Council: \"And since it arises from the necessity of salvation that all the faithful of Christ are to be subject to the Roman Pontiff ( et cum de necessitate salutis existat omnes Christi fideles Romano Pontifici subesse*), just as we are taught by the testimony of the divine Scriptures and of the holy Fathers, and as is declared by the Constitution of Pope Boniface VIII of happy memory, which begins 'Unam Sanctam,' for the salvation of the souls of the same faithful, and by the supreme authority of the Roman pontiff and of this holy See, and by the unity and power of the Church, his spouse, the same Constitution, being approved by the sacred Council, we renew and approve.\"** \n >(Pope Leo X, Fifth Lateran Council, Session 11, 19 December 1516) \n I think this is the most important part relative to what's said above: \n >The phrasing used by the Council cannot be translated as 'absolutely necessary to salvation.' For the verb used is 'existat' (to arise; it arises), and so the phrasing must be \"it arises from the necessity of salvation,\" and not \"it arises necessary for salvation.\" Also, the Council did not use the word 'omnino,' nor any word that could be translated as 'absolutely'. And so it is clear that the necessity to be subject to the Roman Pontiff is not simple and absolute, but secondary, since it arises from another greater necessity, salvation.

And contrary to your opinion, Vatican II no where contradicted those authorities, but rather confirmed that salvation was to be found  no where else  but in the Catholic Church.  There is  no salvation  outside the Church. \n But the Council also carefully elaborated and expounded the Church's meaning.  For example, that those who, through no fault of their own, are ignorant of Christ and his Church may yet be saved.   But  it is not to be supposed that they found salvation  outside  the Church--for outside the Church, no one is saved. \n They are baptized with the baptism of  desire  who, had they  known  of baptism and its necessity, would not have hesitated to receive it at the hands of the Church. \n That man  alone  is culpable of  grave fault  who, knowing that Christ the LORD is the Son of God, and knowing that Christ made the Church on earth the sole, ordinary means of salvation, through whom and by whom the  means  of Grace are administered, namely the Sacraments, and who,  knowing this , would willingly separate himself from her, refuse recourse to her sacraments, and scorn her offer of forgiveness through Jesus Christ Our LORD. \n But this word, \"knowing\", and \"knowledge\" is a funny thing.  How do we \"know\"?  About  what  can we be entirely certain, so that we would bank our lives on it? \n I think in this sense, to  know  is to believe something is  true . \n Paul tells us that, \"whatever is not of faith is sin\".  The conscience must be respected. \n There was a time when I fully believed in my heart of hearts that to render worship to God as Catholics did was sin. \n I was present at a Catholic wedding before my own marriage.  I was scandalized when the bride and groom laid a bouquet of flowers before the statue of Mary.  Idolatry!!! \n My wife's family is Catholic and she was of course raised Catholic.  Before we even began dating I told her that I could never consent to baptize any kids of whom  I  was the father in a Catholic Church, nor could I ever consent to raising them Catholic.  I told her, before she and I ever began dating, so that if that was going to be an impossible impediment to our future relationship and the possibility of marriage, that we should remain just friends.  Rightly or wrongly, she told me that she would consent to baptize and raise our kids Lutheran. \n But her family was still Catholic, and I sometimes attended Mass with her (she was going to church with me at the Lutheran church, but sometimes with aunts and uncles we went to the Catholic church).  Once I got so angry I had to walk out in the middle of the communion service at the Catholic church.  The priest had consecrated the bread and the wine, but he only distributed the bread to the laity.  Communion under  both kinds  was a dear Reformation principle to which I was fervently committed.  This was sacrilege!!!  This besmirched and insulted the dignity of the universal (royal) priesthood of all believers! \n When we were planning our own wedding in the Catholic church, I changed the readings (with the Priest's permission) because I believed the Church had intentionally shortened the passages in Scripture to rob them of their context.  (I didn't tell the priest the reason, but I think he was amused.)  And I insisted that we  not  lay a bouquet or anything else at the foot of any statues.

            "We talk a lot about the relationship between humans and \"droids\" (artificial intelligence), mind uploads, and perhaps even transporter technology ( ala  \"Star Trek\"). \n I think the latter two are very tricky issues.  I've argued that mind uploads won't be possible given that what we call \"mind\" is not  proven  to be identical with \"the brain\".  In fact, both philosophically and (so far) empirically what we call \"mind\" cannot be reduced to physio-chemical reactions in the brain. \n But I think if it  could , it would be very difficult to continue to defend free-will in any meaningful sense.  And without free-will--if human beings are in fact  not  free moral agents--what sort of \"choice\" is left.  If no free-will than we're determined and no one can be held responsible, theoretically, for their actions, their choices, their beliefs, etc.  There could  no longer be a meaningful difference between vincible and invincible ignorance.  If someone  could've  (we would say) have learned what was right or wrong had they taken a little trouble, the fact remains that his \"not taking the trouble\" wasn't really his choice.  He was determined to be ignorant by forces outside his control. \n So no free-will, no moral responsibility, no conceivable or coherent understanding of human destiny but the Calvinist one which, I think, is pretty grim.  I might ask (not as a Calvinist) what possible reason God could have for the creation of man if man is in no sense free to accept or reject Grace? \n Therefore, if a purely physical construct of \"mind\" was found to be true than I think it would be impossible to hold on to free-will. \n But I think there're perhaps two ways of looking at the AI situation.  Say we have a single humanoid body (artificial) with a computer capable of mimicking human thought and behavior.  Now the programming could be artificial--perhaps a programmed \"seed\" that could be programmed to learn and grow; or the \"programming\" could be the result of a \"mind upload\". \n If I'm right about free-will, I'm not sure what claim to dignity a human being has in any case.  I mean, if a person isn't really free to accept or reject God they aren't free to love.  If a person is just \"pre-destined\" to love God quite apart from any choice or volition on their part--even with the help of Grace--than I fail to see how their any better than an automaton; which is the same as a robot anyway.  So it wouldn't matter (really) if the mind/soul/spirit was in an organic or an artificial body or brain. \n But if I'm wrong about free-will and a mind-upload could be possible without rejecting free-will, than I think that an artificial brain/body combination with an authentic human mind upload would be entitled to the same respect and dignity as before. \n But sex--if that was made possible--would still be gravely disordered in any case  unless  sex could be oriented towards procreation.  That seems unlikely  even by the standards of science fiction . \n And of course at the resurrection this \"mind\" would be rejoined to a glorified body created by God (organic, we could presume). \n However, an artificial humanoid shell which included an artificial \"brain\" into which was programmed the code required to emulate human behavior, emotion, though, memory, etc., no matter how complex or authentic it seemed, would in my opinion  not  entitle such a creature to the dignity or respect due to human beings on account of their relationship to the one True God.": "Catholicism",
            "Sorry for the delay in getting back to you. \n I don't understand what you mean here: \n >They are bound together as a doctrine. \n By what \"doctrine\" are they \"bound together\"? \n The Church regards these writings,  and only these writings , as definitely  inspired .  I've quoted before from  the Catechism of the Catholic Church .  Much could be said on this, but I think one small quote will suffice. \n Quoting the Document of the Second Vatican Council, [ Dei Verbum  (Chapter III, Paragraph 11)]( the Catechism says: \n >The inspired books teach the truth. \"Since therefore all that the inspired authors or sacred writers affirm should be regarded as affirmed by the Holy Spirit, we must acknowledge that the books of Scripture firmly, faithfully, and without error teach that truth which God, for the sake of our salvation, wished to see confided to the Sacred Scriptures.\" \n Dei Verbum  continues: \n >Since God speaks in Sacred Scripture through men in human fashion, the interpreter of Sacred Scripture, in order to see clearly what God wanted to communicate to us, should carefully investigate what meaning the sacred writers really intended, and what God wanted to manifest by means of their words. \n I asked above why it  really mattered  if, as a matter of fact, the author of Matthew was mistaken about the dead rising from their graves after the Resurrection of Christ because I suspected: \n \n You come out of  or have been influenced by  a Protestant tradition that holds to the \"doctrine\" of  sola scriptura  (or, \"The Bible  alone \") \n \n That same tradition, which you reject, holds to a strong doctrine of \"Scriptural inerrancy\" (that the Sacred Scriptures, as a whole and in all its parts, is completely without error of any kind) \n \n You believe (or the tradition believes) that Biblical inerrancy is a  core , or central, doctrine, upon which many other truths of the faith necessarily hang \n \n Therefore, if a single error \"of any kind\" were to be found  in any part  of Sacred Scripture (the \"Bible\"), the Bible  as a unit  would be undermined \n \n With the  core doctrine  of Biblical inerrancy undermined (or demonstrated to be false), everything else the Scriptures say can be thrown into doubt  without any further justification \n \n \n I reject this chain of reasoning, though, because: \n \n It gets the what the Church means by \"the books of Scripture firmly, faithfully, and without error\" badly wrong \n \n It  presumes  the legitimacy of  sola scriptura --as if Christianity were really a \"religion of the book.\"  (The Christian faith is not a \"religion of the book.\" Christianity is the religion of the \"Word\" of God, a word which is \"not a written and mute word, but the Word is incarnate and living\". If the Scriptures are not to remain a dead letter, Christ, the eternal Word of the living God, must, through the Holy Spirit, \"open [our] minds to understand the Scriptures.\") \n \n It thus  mistakenly  makes of \"Biblical inerrancy\" a \"core doctrine\", upon which other (or  the ) central doctrines depend \n \n And thus understood, it presents an illusory \"chink in the armor\" of the Christian faith, into which doubts (and excuses; and justifications) can be wedged \n \n \n But really there  is  no such \"chink\". \n First, we distinguish between \"truth\" and \"fact\".  As an example, \"Aesop's Fables\" teach  truth .  But they  don't  relate \"facts\". \n But far from suggesting that the Bible is  on par  with \"Aesop's Fables\", what I mean to suggest is that  inerrancy  regards \"truth\" and not \"fact\". \n The collection of Sacred Scripture  does seem to contain  errors of fact.  But these errors of fact,  if indeed they   are   errors of fact , don't have any effect on the  truth  that God wished to convey by means of the words of the inspired authors. \n But (and this needs to be stressed), it isn't always the case that the inspired authors  meant  to communicate \"facts\" in the sort of dry, scientific way that so many contemporary students of the Bible  expect . \n If, for example, one of the inspired authors, in relating the number of chariots at a given battle, rounds up to the nearest 10,000, it  isn't  the case that the Bible records a \"factual error\".  Because neither the author, nor those for whom the author intended his narration, would have regarded  mathematical precision  (e.g. \" the exact number of chariots was 12,346 \") as a necessity. \n Likewise, when St. Luke says in the beginning of the Gospel that bears his name, that he intended to \"write an orderly account\" of \"the things which have been accomplished among us\", it needn't be regarded as a  fault  that Luke doesn't proceed to give us an account  in chronological order!   First, because he doesn't  say  that's what he intends to do.  And, second, because that isn't what those to whom his narrative was addressed would have necessarily expected. \n But  we  expect that.  Which is why (again) I regard the binding of \"the Bible\" as something of a mistake.  It leads to false impressions.  The Bible starts \"In the beginning\", and so we just naturally expect that the Bible  starts  at the beginning and goes on to the end, in a neat, more or less chronological, historical order. \n I just assumed, for example, that the so-called \"writing prophets\" were chronologically  after  the prophets whose deeds were recorded in the books of Samuel and Kings,  for no other reason  than that their books came after Kings in the Bible.  A moments reflection, of course, is all that's needed to cure this misapprehension. \n But when it comes to the Synoptic Gospels, we haven't  any reason  at all to suppose they were meant to follow Jesus' life, ministry, and passion in anything like a strict chronological order.  Yes, they  begin  with events near the beginning of Jesus' ministry, but they then go on to narrate a selection of Jesus's sayings, miracles, and other incidents in an order that seems more topical and theological (reflective) than chronological.  And John's Gospel (which I regard as more chronological than the others in that it follows Jesus' ministry against the background of the important feasts in the Jewish Calendar, which necessarily brings Jesus and his disciples to Jerusalem and its environs more than once) still seems to follow an order of the author's invention  rather than  a strict \"factual\" order in time, (\"this happened, and then this happened, and after that...\"). \n Getting, finally, to this strange event recorded by Matthew, the possible explanations I gave were meant as an exercise in explaining how it might not just be  straight-forwardly  \"false\".  But what I also wanted to get across is that  it's ok to just not know what the inspired author meant .  He  might  have intended to communicate a statement of dry, historical fact.  Certainly it  seems  that way to us, given the context and the translation.  But it  need not  be the case that  that's what the author intended . \n Returning to the  Dei Verbum : \n >For the correct understanding of what the sacred author wanted to assert, due attention must be paid to the customary and characteristic styles of feeling, speaking and narrating which prevailed at the time of the sacred writer, and to the patterns men normally employed at that period in their everyday dealings with one another. \n This is why I suggested that Matthew's meaning (what he \"wanted to assert\") may simply be  lost  on us.  It's a fair assumption that of the four canonical Gospels,  only Matthew's  was originally intended for a Jewish audience living in the first century.  And if I've learned  one thing  in all my years as a Christian, it's that  I don't think like a first-century Jew .": "DebateAChristian",
            "If you believe there are literal truths in the bible, I am simply asking what they are, where they are, and how you discerned literal truths from non-literal. \n I would have put the most weight on the video discussion between N.T.

You persist in trying to make a distinction between \u201cliteral\u201d and \u201cnon-literal\u201d and I\u2019m trying to say, with Wright, that you're asking a question I can't answer. \n If I may use your own question as a template, I think maybe the question you  want  to ask is \u201cDo I believe there are matters of historical fact in the bible, what are they, where are they, and how can I distinguish between matters of historical fact and metaphors, myths, legends, etc?\u201d \n I think the approach one has to take when trying to discern which accounts in the Bible are intended to convey events that occurred  as matters of historical fact  is to try to establish  the purpose  for which a particular account was written in the first place. \n Because the Creation Account is such a contentious issue, I\u2019ll make that my main focus here. \n I don't think the Creation Accounts in Genesis 1 and Genesis 2 were intended to relay matters of historical fact.  Genesis  isn\u2019t  saying that approximately 6,000 winters have passed since God fashioned the material universe in six twenty-four hour days because I don't think it was the author\u2019s intent to say that.  I\u2019ll try to explain further down why I  don\u2019t  think that; but when it comes to the Flood Account I really don\u2019t know.  The author\u2019s intent  could have been  to relay matters of historical fact as they happened at the time; but I question whether there might have been  other purposes  for writing a story like that. \n Peter writes concerning the Flood, that: \n >God\u2019s patience waited in the days of Noah, during the building of the ark, in which a few, that is, eight persons, were saved through water. Baptism, which corresponds to this, now saves you, not as a removal of dirt from the body but as an appeal to God for a clear conscience, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ. \n Jesus appeals to the story of Jonah, when he says: \n >An evil and adulterous generation seeks for a sign, but no sign shall be given to it except the sign of Jonah. \n But was it the  intent , either of Peter or of Jesus, to affirm the historicity of either reference?  I imagine I could refer to \u201cStar Wars\u201d or \u201cThe Matrix\u201d or  Superman   when making a philosophical or theological point with someone  without  intending to leave the  impression  that I  wanted  to affirm the historicity of those stories or characters. \n Wright draws a comparison between some of the Old Testament accounts and the parables of Jesus.  With the parables we  know  what they are and what they're meant to do.  But when it comes to some of the stories of the Old Testament it isn't so easy. In most cases we  don't  know who the author was and we don't know why it's there. \n Knowing the  purpose  for which something was written (or edited/redacted) is fundamental for understanding how it ought to be read and interpreted.  Was the purpose to establish what happened as a matter of historical fact?  Or was the intent to convey some essential truth about the universe and the way we are  through the form  of an historical narrative? \n I used to feel bound to regard the Creation Account as narrative intended to establish a matter of historical fact  because I had no other way to regard it .  The simple, sad truth is that when someone today picks up Genesis and starts to read  he won't have access to the categories  that were  taken for granted  by those who wrote and read the Creation Account at the time it was written. \n Today we have basically two categories\u2014fact and fiction.  If something isn\u2019t fact it\u2019s fiction.  But this straightforward, simplistic dichotomy between \u201cfact\u201d on the one hand and \u201cfiction\u201d on the other was a relatively recent invention.  (I blame Dewey.) \n Ancient categories and genres included poetry, wisdom literature, parable, metaphor, theologically or politically inspired historical narrative (propaganda), apocalyptic literature, epic, and myth. \n Nor were these understood merely as  ways  of writing about things that did or didn't really happen. \n Let\u2019s take \u201cmyth\u201d, about which there is much modern confusion.  \u201cMyth\u201d doesn\u2019t mean just a fictional story intended to explain something thought to be historical by those who created it.  Instead, myth can\u2019t be categorized by the terms \u201cfact\u201d or \u201cfiction\u201d at all. \n Now, the question might well be asked, \u201cDoes the \u2018myth\u2019 convey matters of historical fact?\u201d  It might not!  But that doesn\u2019t mean the myth should therefore be categorized as fiction. \n It\u2019s tempting at this point for the imagination to grope towards other categories into which the myth might fit.  One compelling possibility is the category of \u201cthe novel\u201d.  After all, we have \u201cnovels\u201d and \u201callegories\u201d (like \u201cThe Pilgrim\u2019s Progess\u201d) that convey things we might call \u201ctrue\u201d in the context of fictional events. \n But that simply won\u2019t do because that\u2019s not what a myth is  doing .  Those in the ancient world for whom literature like \u201cThe Creation Account\u201d or \u201cThe Flood Account\u201d were intended simply weren\u2019t asking, \u201cDid this really happen?\u201d.  In fact it  did  happen!!!  But how?  In what sense?  It's up to us then to discern the \"sense\" in which it  did  happen. \n John Walton wrote a book called \u201cGenesis One\u201d.  I recommend it. \n He approaches the Genesis account from the perspective of comparative studies.  He looks at the literature of the cultures surrounding ancient Israel and tries to discern what all this literature was trying to do.  What was the purpose for which it was written?  And what would those for whom this literature was written have understood when they read it or had it read to them? \n One important point he makes has to do with the concept of \u201ccreation\u201d.  We tend to think of \u201cmaterial\u201d creation when we use that term.  We think of the process by which something became a sensible object with which we could interact and conduct experiments on.  But that\u2019s not what the ancients would have meant.  Walton argues that what the ancients would have understood by \u201ccreation\u201d\u2014even creation  ex nihilo --was  functional  creation.  That God creates something when He gives it a purpose and function.  He created \u201clights in the firmament\u201d, including the sun and the moon, when He gave them the function of being \u201cfor signs and for seasons and for days and years\u201d, for \u201cgiving light\u201d,  and \u201cto rule over the day and over the night, and to separate the light from the darkness\u201d. \n And he \u201ccreated\u201d man when he, \u201cput him in the garden of Eden to till it and keep it\u201d and gave him, \u201cdominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the air and over every living thing that moves upon the earth.\u201d \n This, then, was  functional , rather than  material  creation. \n And the whole  cosmos  (which is the opposite of  chaos \u2014the \u201cwithout form\u201d and \u201cvoid\u201d of Genesis 1:2) is where God makes Himself present or \"tabernacles\".  It's the temple in which God's presence is manifest.  So the Creation Account is the story of how God made a temple, put his image in the temple, and then of the temple's desecration.  The \u201cimage of God\u201d was Adam, which means \u201cman\u201d.  The words \u201cto till and keep\u201d denote a liturgical function.  Keeping the garden was a priestly role conferred upon man in the temple which God Himself created.  (I think this is referenced in both the N.T. Wright video and the Fr. Barron video.) \n Whether or not Walton is right, he's tried to show how the Creation Account might be interpreted using the categories and thought forms of the people for whom the human author of the Creation Account intended it.  It may not be correct, but it is certainly  more correct  (or has a better  likelihood  of being correct) than when it gets shoehorned into modern categories like \u201cliteral\u201d and \u201cnon-literal\u201d; or \u201cfact\u201d or \u201cfiction\u201d. \n And I think the same can be said for much of what we find in the Old Testament.  We need to try to find out what the author intended rather than try to force the literature to conform to our own expectations. \n I think that when we get to the historical books of Maccabees and the Gospels we\u2019re on an entirely different footing.  When St. Luke writes that he intends to construct \u201can orderly account\u201d of the life of Jesus, we can understand him to mean that he, the author, intends to do \u201chistory\u201d in a way that is recognizable\u2014if not identical\u2014to the way you or I might write down events that happened. \n I said \u201crecognizable\u201d but \u201cnot identical\u201d because in Luke\u2019s day, an \u201corderly account\u201d didn\u2019t necessarily mean \u201can account  in order \u201d.  That is, it wasn\u2019t considered necessary to write about events that happened  in the order in which they happened .  One might condense or telescope events, place them in an order that fits a certain organizational schema, conflate characters, occurrences, or speeches, etc.  (I\u2019ve heard that Barrack Obama did some of these things in \u201cDreams From My Father\u201d.) \n And this is the reason the Gospels read like they do.  How they can apparently tell four different stories yet all claim to be \"true\" accounts. Because none of the authors were committed to saying what the needed to say the way we would expect of a modern journalist covering an event. \n For example, the Synoptics  have Jesus going to Jerusalem once for the Passover at the end of his ministry.  John has Jesus going three times. John has the incident with the money changers in the temple at the beginning of his Gospel. The Synoptics have it at the end of theirs. There isn\u2019t any difficulty in that once you realize that no one considered it an act of fiction to write in a way that wouldn\u2019t correspond to how the \u201creporter on the scene\u201d was expected to cover events in the 20th century.": "DebateAChristian"

            "What is it like to not believe in heaven and/or afterlife? \n Comforting. Very comforting. \n Three thoughts concerning heaven/afterlife (copied and pasted from prior comments so there is some overlap). \n \n Most/many theistic worldviews claim the literal existence of an infinite eternity of some portion of the \"I\" that is you in a afterlife - mostly with some sort of conditions of that afterlife (e.g., complete bliss in heaven [sort of like a continuous unstopping opiate binge] to the worst suffering imaginable in a hell) based upon your short and extremely limited existence within the natural physicalistic causality-limited universe we call reality. \n The mindset of someone that wants/desires the conceit of an infinite eternal existence, one that is based upon their earthly existence, will do the minimum to meet the requirements of that religious worldview - just enough to get in (or more correctly - to avoid punishment). Even if this means following the demonstratively often reprehensible morality that makes up the tenets of that religion. In essence - someone that works a religion belief to get into wished for Heaven is often less moral, and does less for humanity/the earth as well as often promoting/causing more actual suffering, than a non-beliver. \n \n What is Heaven?  According to Christianity, heaven is the purpose of all things. Heaven is the reason we live. Heaven is the reason Christ came and the reason he died for our sins. Heaven is the motivator of all of the apostles. Nothing is more important than heaven. Family, love, money, all of these things come second to heaven. [[Source]( \n Then; \n What is the purpose of Heaven?  Heaven is life in its perfected state. We, as creatures of God, are not designed to live in an imperfect world. We are designed to live in a world free from the corruption of sin. We are designed to live in the presence of God where we are free to worship, socialize, and discuss. This life is only a temporary existence. Heaven is where we can exist forever. The day heaven\u2019s gates are opened is the day we begin our lives, not here on earth. The purpose of heaven is to provide a place for us to live. [[Source]( \n Then; \n What is the purpose of living for eternity in a perfected state with God?  In a perfected state with God to provide all it would be Eternally Perfect (and ultimately, Undifferentiated) Bliss, all there is to be known would become known; eternal life in Heaven would quickly become static, unchanging, unremarkable and boring spent in worship of God. Eternal life is ultimately pointless and without merit. \n The real question is:  Ultimately, what is the difference between heaven and hell? \n Nothing. Against an infinite eternity, Heaven and Hell are interchangeable. \n \n Along with the belief in an afterlife, and the limiting mindset that comes with this belief, is the closely associated belief of mind-body dualism (i.e., the soul) where the \"I\" that is you is contained within this soul. \n All evidence supports that the \"I\" (the mind, the source of consciousness, personality, free will, thoughts, ideas, feelings, emotions, memories, the sense of self \u2013 in short, everything a person thinks of as \u201cI\u201d) is the result of the fuzzy logic based neurological network physically based within my brain and nervous system. \n There is zero no direct or indirect credible evidence to support a professed belief in the mind-body daulism (the \"soul\"), no evidence that is verifiable and falsifiable, no philosophical argument that can actually be shown to be linked to a natural physicalistic causality-limited universe, and no evidence that is not an emotional, feeling, wishful thinking, or \"I feel in my heart that this is true\" based subjective experience based upon confirmation bias from prior knowledge of what one's \"God\" image, or from one's religious indoctrination, may be (e.g., Religious Faith). \n When my brain dies, the \"I\" of me dies with it. The \"I\" does not go to any afterlife - which is fortunate because the afterlife purported by many theistic systems is ultimately worthless. The belief in a soul and an afterlife also establishes a state of mind, establishes personality traits, where the actions of the individual are directed towards the next (after) life and leads to the dismissal and abstention of effort and personal responsibility in this real, current, and empirical life. \n \n As to what happens after the \"I\" of me meets death, the components of my body which were formed in the birth pains of the universe and the crucible of pressure and heat within a stellar womb, will eventually be recycled in the fiery furnace of another sun or the paradoxical long/short fall into the event horizon of a black hole. To me, either of these results brings me a bit of joy at it's thought.": "DebateAnAtheist",

Understanding the nature of limitation with help of some formal proofs will imply two auxiliary theorems that have a corollary that corresponds with Christian Theism: \n F1: If per assumption a limiting property limits its possessor, then not having the limitation will not limit its possessor. \n F2: Let B be some limiting property, and A entails it. Then B is a prerequisite for A. So the lack of B means a lack of A. If the possessor is limited by B, but not by ~B, then by modus ponens A is limiting. \n F3: A moral/aesthetic privation is present when any member of a domain is inaccessible. Accessibility, being an equivalence relation in S5, means that the domain of alethically (ontically) possible worlds is accessible, otherwise a moral/aesthetic privation is present.\" \n And it continues with more specialized language and presentation of symbolic logic. \n I would have trouble debating this argument as I need to reference a dictionary of philosophy or tome of symbolic logic every second or third word/symbol just to understand (or try to anyway) what is actually being argued.": "DebateReligion",

Yet, within the Holy Scriptures of predecessor Ugarit and Canaanite religions/societies/cultures, the evidence points to the growth in the belief of the monothesitic Yahweh God from a polytheistic foundation of the El God pantheon in the ancient Ugarits and Canaanites who became the early Israelites.

The agnostic atheist fails to reject the null hypothesis that {supernatural deities do not exist|based on lack of evidence}. \n Let's look at some definitions of atheism from \"encyclopedias of philosophy\": \n \n [Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy](   \n \n \u2018Atheism\u2019 means the negation of theism, the denial of the existence of God. I shall here assume that the God in question is that of a sophisticated monotheism. The tribal gods of the early inhabitants of Palestine are of little or no philosophical interest. They were essentially finite beings, and the god of one tribe or collection of tribes was regarded as good in that it enabled victory in war against tribes with less powerful gods. Similarly the Greek and Roman gods were more like mythical heroes and heroines than like the omnipotent, omniscient and good God postulated in mediaeval and modern philosophy.   As the Romans used the word, \u2018atheist\u2019 could be used to refer to theists of another religion, notably the Christians, and so merely to signify disbelief in their own mythical heroes. \n So here is an \"encyclopedia of philosophy\" with a definition negates the very argument that Craig uses to support his lack of atheism towards supernatural deities/Gods other than that of monotheistic yahwehism which lies at the foundation of the Christian apologetics that Craig supports. \n \n [Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]( \n \n The term \u201catheist\u201d describes a person who does not believe that God or a divine being exists.

Try to comprehend the complex symbioses of life.  Inward further, ponder the workings of our bodies, the complex [biochemistry]( that runs every cell, and further the [randomness]( and [probability]( that they operate on in the micro scale. \n Consider time as well; how much time has passed on [this planet alone]( or in the [universe as a whole](  Ponder the untold aeons that came before us, and that which will follow our demise. \n And after you ponder all this, I am humble.

I have but one complaint with that, and it is that it stifles conversation. \n There is a certain sadistic pleasure to be had in berating someone, demonstrating the cases in which they're being illogical and generally proving that you're right and they're wrong (nyah, nyah!), but generally this sort of browbeating is counter-productive.

Your points fall on deaf ears because you deafened them with the way you approached.  This is, similarly, my biggest critique on Dawkins; while interesting and sometimes visceral, what is his target audience?  Believers?  The tone of his books looses more of that audience then it endears.  Atheists?

Does a creature have to sets of genes, one that controls what species it is that can't change and one that controls what it can \"adapt\", which can change?  Yeah, no.  You seem either too incapable or too unwilling to recognize that your \"adaptation\", given a long span of time, leads to speciation.  There is no difference between macro and micro evolution; macro evolution is simply the results of micro evolution given enough time.  If you're going to continue to attest to this blatantly wrong idea, the least you could do is explain  why  macro doesn't work but micro does. \n So; I'll wait right here for you to refute each and every example in favor of common descent, and for you to back up why macro is impossible and not the natural extension of micro, and for you to come up with a scientific theory that explains the diversity of life on earth which is well supported by all the evidence provided by the scientific community to this point, including that in the articles above. \n Maybe I'll get a coffee.  I expect I'll be waiting quite a while. \n Oh yes, and on the accusation of being a religion, allow me to quote a rather [lovely work](\n> Hmm, that's a good point; let me think about it.

            "Let me tackle what is arguably the harder issue first: \n Morality, secular or not, does not need such an external standard; we have enough inherent to us and the nature of life and reality.  The big issue at hand, of course, is whether or not morality is objective (that is, something universal and constant) or subjective (that is, dependent in some form or another on people and their subjective thoughts and ideas).  Simply, I would argue the latter is the case, and that it frankly doesn't change anything. \n This is a bit of a longer discussion, but the short version is that it is sufficient to see morality is a biological and social construct grown from simple origins as a set of instincts allowing for early group behavior and herd-structure which has then, thanks to our ability to educate and share ideas, become a broad social construct with local variance (that is, ethics) yet which shares core principles including the harm principle.  Morality is not some universal thing, but it is grounded in our nature; it remains derived from us, as a biological life form for which working together is a viable reproductive strategy.  Further, despite being subjective, morality can be described as having several obvious goals - reduce harm, allow interaction, allow group efforts, compensate for differing values, that sort of thing; with a goal in mind, morals stems can be objectively compared to each other as to which best accomplishes them.  Or, to put it differently, our nature and the commonalities between us are more then enough grounding for morality; we don't need to claim some external support, and certainly have no reason to think morality would not exist without such a thing. \n Further, I reject the notion of morality as objective because an objective morality would render it static, where as our morality clearly continues to grow and develop as we learn more about what we value and why.  Objective morality, likewise, leaves no room for variance in ethics.  Further still, I reject the notion that a god-like being could even act as a moral standard in the first place; by definition, if our morality is based on god - a being with a mind - then it is  subject  to him and his goals, motivations, and whims.  That is, it would make morality  subjective .  Also, while on the topic, given that there are various different interpretations of god even among Christians (often based on the personal ethics of individual Christians), saying that morality is objective in that it comes from god is useless unless you can prove that everyone else's interpretation of god is wrong. \n \n Right, setting that aside for the moment, the big issue with the remainder is twofold: first, and most damningly (if you'll pardon the pun) is the lack of support.  Claiming that god's goodness and godliness are intertwined is fair, but demonstrating that is next to impossible; you have no means to tell the difference between a good god and an evil god who's a propagandist. \n When you say \"god has unquestionable perfection because of who he is\" - who told you that?  How do you know that?   Is it from men?  God himself?  Men can be deceived, and an evil god could lie.  When you ask \" Who are we as mortals to hold up our morality against the standards of a perfect God?\" - I am reminded of an abusive partner, who convinces his spouse that she is stupid, weak, and in need of his guidance.  Such a statement could just as easily descend from a evil god as a good one. \n Beyond that, why would a perfect god want to be glorified anyway?  A perfect being should have no lacks, and thus nothing it could possibly desire, glory included.  Thus, either an imperfect god lacks glory and needs to get it through creation (and therefore, us), or perfect god does not lack glory, and thus could not possibly want to obtain it through our creation. \n But perhaps you don't agree about the nature of perfection; that's fine.  In that case, the question instead is how a moral being could possibly create something with a mind  only for the sake of glorifying itself with no thought places towards the mind .  To punish a created mind eternally for not glorifying its creator when is a bit like having a child and then locking it forever in the basement if it disagrees with you, or like a mad roboticist creating an AI capable of independent thought, then deciding that unless it obeys his every word he would download it into an isolated server and trigger its pain impulses over. \n What glory there is to be found in creating an independent mind is not in that mind thinking \"why yes, my creator is awesome, all praise on to him\" and punishing it if it does not - that's just narcissistic.  If the creation of an independent mind is to be glorious, the mind must be  independent .  Why would one possibly create something with a given trait when it is its that trait's  absence  that is meant to glorify?": "TrueChristian",
            "Actually, I was speaking of your broader argument.  The one above works, it just doesn't show what you think it shows - and when you try to make it do so, it's fallacious. \n Now, on Teleology, I'm not at all surprised that you write below \"The longer I go, the more I'm convinced...\" - as discussions with you consistently involve you ignoring a point and restating your own, I could see how that could prevent you from changing your mind. \n But because it fits rather nicely here, allow me to repost the end of one of our earlier discussions: \n \n What you have demonstrated here, and demonstrated well, is that essentially anything can be  described  as teleological. However, that does not grant teleology validity. It's an artifact of language, not a trait of the universe. Or, more appropriately, it lacks all nature of special or supernatural connotation. It's not really relevant that we have the  easiest  time to describe the world in - surprise, surprise - human terms. It's somewhat akin claiming that \"stuff\" is a valid measure of existence, because everything is quite easily described as \"stuff\". Not the best analogy, of course, but I'm hoping you see my point. \n There seems to be a problem with the way you are struggling against naturalism - essentially, your main point is \"teleology exists, so naturalism is false because it rejects teleology\". The trouble is that you haven't actually demonstrated that. Naturalism has never debated the fact that we can  describe  this process or that event in teleological terms; it rejects teleology as a valid method of description because teleology is unable to differentiate between different \"causes\" or \"goals\", and can make no measure (as you mention) - this is due to the fact that as a pure anthropomorphization, teleology is entirely subjective, and has no objective merit. It would be akin to claiming that a person's emotional reaction to something is a valid description of that something on an objective level; while such an opinion or observations of such opinions may have merit to certain fields (psychology, mayhaps), how one emotionally reacts to, say, the color of a chemical reaction is not a good measure of anything outside themselves, and certainly not a sign that there is a universal trait of \"emotionality\" that every object has. \n The irony here, of course, is that as something that is entirely subjective or language-based, teleology - or specifically the ability to describe something as teleological - is a direct product of the brain, which is a direct product of (as discussed) complex biochemistry. Using it to try to disprove naturalism isn't just wrong, it's downright backwards as it's a (by)product of a naturalistic system. \n If you want to show that your line of argument here is valid, you are going to have to demonstrate that teleology exists in an objective manner, not merely you or I having the ability to phrase things theologically. Or perhaps to address it another way, teleology in the way you have described it is not actually opposed to naturalism, but is instead a shoddy and irrelevant description of naturalistic phenomena, which is rejected not because it can't be ascribed or asserted, but because it lacks either meaning or predictive power and is entirely subjective. You'd need to demonstrate it is something supernatural, and that what you claim is teleological can't arise naturally.": "DebateReligion"

            "Not even bothering with a throwaway, I don't care who knows any more. \n Long story short, I've had an addiction to online sexual roleplaying since I was 17 or so. I was first introduced to visual porn when I was 12. I'm 32 now. I did my best to fight it once she and I started dating, and did it a lot less. When we got married, I committed to not doing it, but had 'slips' a handful of times. \n She caught me once about a year into our marriage. Of course she was very upset and hurt but we were able to move forward. I installed something on our network that should have prevented me from being able to get my fix. \n Unfortunately, I work in IT and from home at that,  and with some effort got around it when I needed my fix next. It's happened less than 5 times total in our marriage of 3+ years, and each time I took steps with self-discipline, online support groups, and talking it over with my Pastor in Confession, and progress was being made. I never intended to slip, but I did, and when I did that time between slips was greater and greater. \n I slipped again the other day. We'd both been sick and working weird hours so we hadn't made love in over 3 weeks. Not an excuse, just background. I knew even as I was doing it that this wasn't working, there is something wrong with me, I don't want to do this any more but I keep doing it anyway. I needed to get into whatever the sex equivalent of AA was and/or see a therapist in addition to other steps. \n She caught me. \n She's beyond livid. She thinks she never really knew me, can't believe she ever trusted me, and that the only reason I'm seeking help or that I ever went to Confession is because I'm sorry I got caught, not truly sorry. If I was truly sorry I wouldn't have done it  AGAIN. \n I can't fault her conclusions from her standpoint,  but she doesn't understand how addiction and compulsion affect one's capacity to make rational decisions. She doesn't have that problem, closest she has is a druggie/alcohol uncle she doesn't know very well who AFAIK is in recovery as of right now. I'm not going to try and explain it to her at this point because she's tired of excuses and understandably so. \n Today is day 3 since it happened. Shit got worse on day 2, when she asked how long it had been since I did it last.  I answered her truthfully. \n My addiction is the only thing I've ever lied to her about out of shame and fear. Apart from that we are completely honest with each other. I told her it had been about 8 months. She got even more upset because she now knew this wasn't the second time I'd done it, I'd done it at least one other time that she didn't know about and then lied by omission about it. I didn't need to tell her how many times, it didn't matter. \n After she realized that, she became even more irate and hurt than she had when she first found out. After yelling at me, she left and is staying at her aunt's house \"for a while.\" \n I spent an hour in Confession with our parish priest. As a former alcoholic himself and a married man (Anglican Use Catholic parish) he understood the addiction aspect of what I was going through. Going forward, he's going to help arbitrate as best he's able as well as help hold me accountable. \n Divorce and annulment are off the table as far as I'm aware as there aren't really grounds for either. She said \"I  will  leave you [emphasis hers] if you don't treat me with the respect I deserve,\" which seems to imply she's not considering divorce. Priest said there are no grounds for annulment since I am and have been actively addressing the problem and seeking to repent and be forgiven. \n But it will never be the same again. I don't know what to do. Pray, of course. Demonstrate trustworthiness. Apart from that...I don't know what to expect our marriage will become. We had been planning on having a baby in the next year or so. That's off the table. \n She's the only person I've ever loved. We've known each other since we were 13. I was going to say \"I don't want to lose her,\" but I realized after the thought ran through my head that I've already lost her. \n I'm calling the Sexaholics Anonymous hotline after I post this and going to a meeting tomorrow night. \n Fortunately I have Mass and a social gathering that I'm going to force myself to go to tomorrow during the day. \n I guess this is as much venting as anything else, but any insights would be appreciated.": "REDDITORSINRECOVERY",

I really don't give two shits about what the government defines as marriage. Marriage is a Sacrament witnessed by the Church. \n Other Christian sects believe that it's a secular institution and the ceremony in, say, an Episcopal church, is just a formality. To many non-Catholic Christians, non-Christians, atheists, and 'spiritual but not religious' folks, this is the core of the argument. \n We are different (isn't that an understatement!) than the above. Ultimately, I don't care what the government says as they've repeatedly proved themselves to be corrupt, selfish, immoral, unrepentedly sinful greed mongers. Tax benefits, medical visitation privileges, next of kin, etc. can all be dealt with via private contract, so there's no real need for the US gov't to continue to involve itself with marriage by the secular definition.

            "About 30-40 people. I went to a high school way across from town from the one I was zoned for to attend their Engineering, Science and Technology Magnet program. Was a kinda big deal, I guess, had to have X GPA and write an essay to apply, and there were only a limited number of spaces, etc. \n So our giant final semester project was a 'decades' project.

Before I even parked my car this little terror(about 8 years old?) was already a menace.  He was standing in the middle of the single lane dirt road as I was approaching the house.  He didn't feel the urge to move and I practically brought the car to a full stop before he got out of the way.  As soon as I parked the car and stepped out to greet the family, the kid immediately jumps in the front seat and starts honking the horn.  The parents say \"yeah, you'll have to pull him out of there\".  Keep in mind Im meeting these people(my friend's brother's family) for the first time at this very moment.  I hesitated for a second before it soaked in that they were expecting ME to correct their child.  Eventually they pulled him out on their own.  Later, after we get done eating some BBQ I go back to my car to retrieve my firearms and I noticed that during the time we were eating he must have thrown a few handfuls of gravel on my car.  Nice.  The parents see all of this and just simply encourage him to occupy himself with some other activity.  Things only escalate from there.  We bring out the rifles and I set mine(unloaded) next to my friend on a bench, inside its case(closed).  I start to walk about 30 feet away to retrieve the ammo and I turn around to just double check that my friend is keeping an eye on the gun I set next to him.  He's looking the other way and sure enough the kid has the case open and is trying to pick it up.  I yell at my friend and he disarms the child.  Here comes the worst part.  The father comes over and tells him that he better not catch him touching a gun again.  Before the dad even finishes his sentence the kid immediately reaches his hand out to touch the gun to show open defiance to the dad's authority.  Once this happens the Dad picks the child up and is taking him inside to his room.  Im thinking \"good, the kid's finally going to get disciplined.\"  But no, the kid starts crying as they get closer to the door so the father responds with \"ok, but you have to be good then\".

I end up having to sit on the box to get him to stop.  Its pretty ridiculous.  He begins to cry then finally his mom reacts, but not in the way I would have liked.

Today, I bought a tiny piece, about the size of a dime (it's expensive, yo!) at the local place with stones. When I first held it, I got a strong vibe from it, but nothing too amazing. (I've been kind of off today & am still kinda new to all this stuff.) However, I had brought my boyfriend, who's a lot more sensitive to stones with me. I handed it to him without telling him what it was & it made him uncomfortable & he was like, \"Man this is weird, what is that (feeling/vibe)??? Is that algae?\" Then, I told him it was a Tektite & he started talking about \"space eels\" coming from it & he didn't want to be around it at all. He doesn't trust it because it's not from Earth. :/  Has anybody else experienced/ worked with this stone? How did it affect you? Any suggestions for how to use it?": "occult",
            "When I didn't find a post out here on this subject right away, I thought: \" WTF, dudes/ladies? How has astral sex not been brought up here yet???\" Then, after doing some research, I found out why. It's because it's complicated as hell. :P You're combining 3 subjects alone that are complicated enough by themselves: 1) Astral Projection  2) Sex/Relationships & 3)Personal Morals/Values. ~No wonder it's hard to find anything on this. \n So, I've been trying to figure out my opinion on this topic for quite a while. It's hard for me because I've never experienced astral sex. I've never even astrally traveled.  However, my SO has astral sex with one particular spirit (from another realm-further complicating things) on a regular basis. He says he's in love with her.  It's been on my mind since I've found out about it & trying to talk with him about it hasn't exactly gone over well. (Except, maybe once.) Hence, here I am. \n Searching the internet, I've come across a couple of different opinions, but there's really not that much out there on the topic. :/ Here's what I did find: \n First, there's the \"What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas! :D It's actually great for everyone! ;-)\" sort of philosophy. The following quotes kinda sum-up what appeared to be one blogger's educated opinion: \n>\"Since this person is in spirit and you are in the physical, there should be no guilt even though you may be presently in a relationship. In fact, your astral lover will encourage you to form physical relationships and may even guide you to the right person. The astral lover will do all in her/his power to help you have a happy, fulfilling life in all ways.\" \"Loving on the astral is not a betrayal of your physical mate or\ncompanion. If anything, it will enhance your physical love-making.\" \n Found that here: \n Then, on the other hand, there's kind of the opposite opinion, that the astral\\spirit sex has the potential to down-play or hurt relationships on the physical plane. I ran into this kind of idea a couple of times on reddit. One person said, \n> \"Its [spirit sex is] beyond awesome but I think I made too good of friends with this spirit because anytime I get a real girlfriend I don't find them interesting sexually compared to the spirits. Once I break-up with the woman the spirits have seem to come back full-force... the feeling from the divine is hard to get from another human.\" \n Then, another said,\n> \"The spirit spoils you, with that perfect sensed reflection of untrammeled, sweet deep fiery love, the love of the divine that penetrates deeper than doubting, hesitant material love seems able to. It redefines the concept in a way that makes it incongruent with how 'real' physical love develops. I've lost the two lovers I even tried to take to childish dissatisfaction and disappointment, and now I just think it's kinder to be the waiting widow or widower than to make someone earnest feel like s/he's not good enough in the face of such a rival. In the end at best they only think you're off your head, and maybe that's best. It's a confusing way to go.\" \n You can go to the sub-reddit these came from here: \n And that's all I got. :/  To say that I'm left confused at this point is a bit of an understatement.  Questions that have been bothering me are: \n \n Is astral/spirit sex with another being while in a monogamous relationship on this plane morally correct? Or is it cheating? \n \n Is astral/spirit sex with others bad for one's relationship with their SO? Or, could it actually be beneficial, as suggested by one person's opinion above? \n \n Does/should monogamy only apply to the realm one's SO resides in? \n \n \n I'm very torn & confused on this topic. It's been eating at me, badly. My boyfriend thinks I've become a bit obsessed with it, & perhaps that's true. To me, fidelity, honesty, & loyalty are integral to relationships. Not knowing if these things are being honored in mine is going to continue bothering me until I can figure this out.  I just want to be able to let it go , but in order to do that, I have to know what it is that I'm coming to terms with... if that makes since. :/ \n Any opinions/ comments/ answers to the questions above are greatly appreciated! :)": "AstralProjection",
            "Yes, a literal \"fairy\" (in his mind). In my opinion, \"she's\" either a demon of some kind or something he created from too much past shroom usage. He's an occultist. \n I'm depressed as hell. It's been over 2 weeks & I'm still completely useless. I've got so many things I should be doing to restart my life, but I'm just so fucking depressed. \n It's completely irrational. He was insane & problematic, & not because of the \"fairy\". He would \"curse\" random strangers that pissed him off somehow. He was socially awkward. He couldn't have a serious discussion without losing it & literally screaming & snarling. He doesn't own a car or have a license by choice, which is abnormal for the city he lives in. He rarely washed his clothes & the last time he did, I had to bribe him with Taco Bell to get him to come to my apartment to wash them for free. He had no friends left & bad relationships with his family. My therapist told me he sounded like he had the emotional intelligence of a 13 year old boy. (My ex & I are both 31, btw.) \n He also treated me like shit. He would cook for himself while I was over & suggest I make peanut butter toast if I was hungry. He spent all his time I was around on his computer or doing magic-related stuff while I waited for the occasional 1-minute \"cuddle break.\" \n Then, about 3 months ago, he bragged about his fairy-fucking online (how I found out about it) & when I asked him about it, he told me it had been going on for several months & he was more in love with the fairy than he was with me. He had sex with her at least every other day. He said I should be okay with it. I was crushed. He said if I had a problem with it, I should \"FUCK OFF AND DIE.\" I was confused because he said fidelity was something that was supposed to be limited to earth/ this realm. (He completely came up with that himself.) So, I went to reddit, on here & asked what other \"occultists\" thought about what he was doing. I submitted lots of interesting threads starting with [this]( The only people who thought it was okay were self-described polyamorists. That's it. And even they said he'd cheated by hiding it from me. I was really confused. When I tried talking with him about my findings & that I was hurt, he just lost it every time. This went on for somewhere between 2 or 3 months. \n About 2 weeks ago, I had put up a thread on /r/shamanism because he had recently decided to enlighten me that \"she's\" his supposed spirit-guide. So, I wanted to ask if it was normal to fuck your spirit guide when your in a relationship. Well, he saw my post, & even though he had previously told me it was okay to post stuff about it online, he said he wasn't okay with it anymore. He \"no longer liked me as a person\" & didn't want to be around me anymore. Iow, he broke up with me so he could fuck his fairy in peace. \n Why am I upset?? He behaved like a crazy person & treated me like crap. But he could be sweet. He was extremely loving when we would cuddle & be intimate. There was chemistry there that I'd never had with anyone before & don't know if I ever will again. It was just as painful as it was pleasant in the end though. When he said, \"I love you,\" all I heard was, \"I love you, but I love her more.\" And that shit hurt. When I was away from him, I'd think about him, the way people do when they're in love. But, when he was away from me, he was fucking his fairy. That shit hurt. \n So, why am I still broken now?? Shouldn't I be relieved?? Shouldn't I be glad I don't have to deal with his insanity every day??\nThis is irrational! I just want to stop hurting so I can move on & feel the relief I'm supposed to from exiting an emotionally abusive relationship.": "relationships",

I also went off pharmaceutical anti-depressants around the same time, which had been curbing my libido, switching to natural meds. Something notable is that, a bit later, Jo showed me the spell, & it said for her to \"long for his bed each night.\" He said he hadn't meant it in a sexual context, but rather to just mean that she was to want to be around him, at his place in the evenings.\nHowever, I've had an issue with a deep longing/aching feeling in  my lower stomach, where my second/sacral chakra would be, when I think about him/am around him. It's unlike anything I've felt before. At first, it didn't happen all the time, but often enough to be a little bothersome. The only thing that made it go away was to have sex with him. This wasn't too much of an issue at first because there was enough passion in the relationship to satisfy me.  However, a few months in, he started getting less interested in sex than I was. Jo rarely initiated it, he would only last a few minutes & he wasn't as \"present\" or enthusiastic as before. He would say, \"You know we don't have to have sex all the time.\" & \"I'm not a  dildo.\" However, I still had the same longing/ache. This was causing friction in the relationship. Then, about a month ago, I found out that he had started having regular, about ever-other-day astral sexual relations with, & had fallen in love with, a being from another realm, several months previous, around the same time he had started behaving differently towards me. I wrote about that here:  He said that it did not affect the relationship between him & me & that \"'she' really, really liked\" me. I tried to accept/deal with this new information. I even brought it up with my therapist, who said Jo sounded self-absorbed & emotionally immature. However, the longing/aching ended up getting more frequent/intense & unpleasant, especially when I would think about him with \"her.\" It was almost unbearable at times.

We had had the usual brief sex earlier that evening, but I was getting the longing/ache again. We had also talked about his spirit \"companion\", so it was very intense. I tried asking for sex & he said no. I was upset because I knew I was going to have to deal with it the entire weekend away from him. Jo could tell I was upset & he got very, very angry, because he was already very stressed about something else. He called me a monster who wanted to use him as a human dildo. I just wanted to talk about what was happening, but he said it stressed him out too much. Then, I left & he broke up with me VIA TEXT MESSAGE. Jo said he wanted me to  stay away from him. He's a fairly accomplished witch, & not at all a sympathetic/empathetic person. He was only ever interested in what was going on in my life if there was magic he could practice to  try fixing it. Jo's only likely concern towards me now is to keep me away, regardless of his claims to have loved me before.  He has a tendency to push people away like that. It's possible he's going to do spells to \"block\" me to encourage my staying away from him, which he does to people he doesn't like. So, I don't expect him to be any help towards my situation/undoing the spell. The situation is further complicated by the fact that I know zero magic.

            "I have a boyfriend, of about 8 months, who calls himself a shaman. He has a few Gods and several \"familiars\". One of them is a woman with green skin, a tree fairy, whom he's recently informed me is his spirit-guide. \n A couple of months ago, I found out he's been having sex with his green \"sexy, sexy tree fairy\" spirit almost the whole time we've been dating (about 6 months). I only found out about it bc of something I ran into that he posted on reddit. (I know his name & we frequent the same subs. He didn't think I'd notice it.) \n He said he didn't tell me about his sexual astral relations because he wouldn't ever admit it to anyone unless it was anonymously. He says he did a spell for her that made her free so no one could bind her. But she will be around forever, as his spirit-guide. She also heals him, among other things, but according to him, since she will be around, he will have to be screwing her because he's in love with her.  He admits to being more in love with her than me.  They used to have sex about every other day before I found out about it. He claims they do it less frequently now because my finding out about it has made it a little awkward. \n I've read online about how nothing between two humans compares to what happens when one is intimate with a spirit. What I've read stated that sex between spirits is often a form of tantric sex that creates a soul-bond that enhances & permeates the connection between the two spirits. I've also read that shamans have been known to have sex with their spirit guides in the past, along with witches with their familiars. \n Now I'm frustrated because I don't know how to feel. This is unlike any situation I've ever been in.  Is it rational to be jealous of someone's relationship with a being from another dimension?  He left his wife for being unfaithful to him, but that was with a human person. He says infidelity only counts between those in the flesh, on the same plane. \n I've tried talking with him about it (him & the fairy) & how it relates to/affects our relationship several times. However, 4 out of 5 times it ends with him throwing a tantrum, screaming about how he's a free-spirit, how I don't own him & that what he does with his spirit, mind, or imagination is his business alone. \n When I've asked him to tell me how it's not cheating, he's said: \"1) It's a dream 2) Because the only way to properly understand is to experience this yourself.\" Then he said, \"Well, Mud Girl [that's what he calls me when he's extra angry] i'm not entirely sure where these places are but that's the common answer that we give to ignorant shits. but if it will finally shut you up, sure. that's about as close to an explanation as I have been able to get.\"  Yes, I'm aware that the way that he speaks to me sometimes is incredibly degrading. That's not what I'd like to focus on though, if y'all wouldn't mind. \n I was wondering if, from anyone's experience here, they might have any insight or suggestions as to what I might do, or suggest a different perspective to look at this situation from. \n If at all possible, I want to find a way to be okay with it.

It's idiotic. There's much more legitimate forms of persecution going on around the world, and we really have to complain that the privileged Christian elite can say their prayers in public?

Conversions happened, yes. Religions are not race-locked, no. But they,  by necessity,  are bound to certain cultures. Christianity has its own culture entirely and it functions very poorly when operating outside of it. Likewise, heathenry functions very poorly if one doesn't learn to sift out as much Christian culture as possible. \n From my observation, though, most native groups  heavily  discourage non-tribe members co-opting their practices.

            "but  refused  Jesus and will burn for it \n This is the key point in my opinion. If I have understood that Jesus is the truth and then STILL REJECT him out of MERE ARROGANCE then I too think I'll end up in hell. \n This may sound contradictory to my previous statement at a superficial level, but if you dig a bit deeper you will see that it's not. \n Why is good conduct important? I feel it's because it's a PURER state compared to bad conduct. Let's understand this using two examples \n 1) You are at work and you DESPERATELY need a promotion, you don't even mind stepping on your friend/co-worker and go behind his back to please your boss and get a promotion. You undo his work, defame him, backbite about him and in the end you get your promotion. Let' say you decide not to do that and you chose to be good and let go your greed or in other words your ARROGANCE where you thought you were more deserving for the promotion than him. This is a good conduct which emerged out by letting go a form of arrogance. \n 2) You REALLY like someone and you want to marry her, you create a lie and show her an Image of you which you aren't. This betrayal for love is another form of ARROGANCE where you think she doesn't deserve to know the truth. But, you have every right to not do this and be true to her and let go the arrogance, good conduct. \n Good conduct is good because you are choosing not to have an arrogant attitude towards fellow human, but that of empathy. Now, this humble attitude should not just be in your conduct but also in your thought. For example, if you are convinced that 2+2 = 4, you can't stay I still REJECT this because my parents/culture/religion/country thought me otherwise. This is not just rejection but a display of arrogance. \n Now, the question comes as to what form of ARROGANCE is bad and can not be forgiven. To this the Abrahamic God says, they are two forms which if done will completely undo any good deeds one has. They are \n 1) Rejecting a God sent prophet ( or son in Christian terminology ), once it's completely established that he is a God sent and the person is completely certain and has no doubts about the fact. Rejection then out of mere arrogance or prejudice is unforgivable. \n 2) Killing someone without any just cause. This is another grave sin, which has the power of undoing all your good deeds.": "DebateReligion",

I am about 99% a cessationist, meaning I don't believe prophecy continues, but I have gone to and had fellowship with churches (Sovereign Grace Ministries) that think the command to prophesy overrides the command for women to be silent.  I don't have a huge problem with that.  I certainly don't have the gift of prophecy, hehe, so I am not needing to puzzle it out too much. :) \n That said, the supernatural moving of God for a woman to speak in a service (prophecy) is still different from a woman offering her own opinion.  I find the greatest indicator of what Paul is trying to say is 14:35, that if women have  questions  -- not even observations or statements! -- they are to ask at home. \n I agree Paul sounds snarky in v 36, but I read it as referring back to the beginning of the discussion about orderliness in church, not just the most recent part, and v 37-38 sounds really dire (\"if anyone doesn't recognize this is the Lord's command... he is not recognized\") if Paul had just been quoting an  invalid  argument.

It is not AT ALL parallel to infant baptism in terms of theology or occurrence (i.e., this is not a defining mark of Baptists).  I've gone to ARBCA, SBC, IFB, and evangelical Baptist churches in my life, and only  one  of those (the evangelical one) practiced dedications at all, and even then it was quite controversial there and the vast majority of people did not participate.  It is certainly not a universal or necessary feature of Baptist church \"culture.\"  Even Baptists who dedicate freely acknowledge that it's not a biblical ceremony. \n \n Dedication is not \"rather than\" baptizing them.  When it's done, the theology there is totally different.  Dedicating babies is more akin to a church dedicating the building when they break ground on a new sanctuary.  They correctly note that it has nothing to do with covenant theology, but then make a connection that depends on covenant theology.  It's just, utterly not true and misleading.  Baptists dedicate their children as a statement that no matter what, they give the child and its eternal destiny over to God.  It is not in hope of their future salvation, it has nothing to do with salvation.  It's saying, \"no matter what You do with this child, I will praise You; s/he's not mine to hold on to.\" \n \n While I agree that infant dedication is incorrect, it  does  have at least a singular basis in Scripture -- Hannah dedicated Samuel.   Samuel 1:27:  \"I now give the boy to the Lord. For as long as he lives, he is given to the Lord.\"  That's exactly what Baptists who dedicate infants are doing and what they claim to be doing and the biblical basis for which they do it.  Also, this is more biblical warrant than there is for paedobaptism.  ;) \n \n This \"apparently instinctively reflecting their desire that their children belong to the Lord\" is very condescending and again, inaccurate.  Infant dedications are a statement of recognition that our children  do  belong to the Lord.  Again, this is imposing a covenant theology justification (wherein \"belong to the Lord\" means in a salvific sense, or else there is no \"instinctive reflection\" going on) on something that has nothing to do with covenant theology ( all  things belong to the Lord, including our children, but not at all in a salvific way; the vessels of destruction likewise belong to the Maker).": "Reformed",

            "Hmm.  I cook for a family (mine) of seven, and our grocery budget runs a bit higher than $125.35 per head, a month.  And five of my seven people are children, and that's cooking in bulk.  I don't buy organic, gluten-free, or any of that stuff.  Just basic food.  And I'm spending our own money, of course, so I have good motivation not to waste it -- rice and beans are a regular on our table.  I make bread, sauces, etc. from scratch.  Pizza from scratch.  We buy vegetables from farm stands (cheaper), frozen, etc.  The vast majority of our meat is dark meat chicken, which is the cheapest, and I buy it at warehouse clubs, where it is the cheapest, or on sale at grocery stores almost-expired, and freeze it.  In other words, I'm not a very pricey shopper.  And yet I still spend about $160/mo per person on food.  (Admittedly, this is highly dependent on area, and could easily be $125 in other parts of the country... another problem.) \n Now,  could  I do it for $125?  For sure.  Especially since we have so many people, and cooking in bulk is real savings.  But we'd slip significantly below the edge of health that we teeter on--or eat food that made us miserable.  I admit you could eat rice and beans every night for $125.  Plain oatmeal for breakfast.  Maybe afford a generous peanut butter sandwich for lunch.  You COULD make it healthy.  But it takes time, which many poor people don't have the luxury of when they're waiting for buses all day so they can make it to their minimum-wage job.  And it creates misery--do you want to eat rice and beans every night?  I don't.  Poor people are still  people , with the same needs for basic enjoyment as the rest of us.  Even worse, how many people who are struggling to make ends meet that you know of have the fundamental education in food management, cooking, and nutrition in order to even begin to be able to compile a healthy menu for $125?   I  know how to cook, how to budget, how to balance a meal--because my upbringing made sure I knew all those things.  But I talk to people all the time who have no idea how to even begin to use a cookbook, or that HFCS is bad for you, or that beans are a great, fairly nutritious, cheap staple.  It amazes me how many people have no idea that dried beans are even a thing.  How many people have never been taught to pay off their credit card bill, or how to balance a checkbook.  Much less how to read a nutrition facts label and make good decisions based on accumulating all the data from their food and making sure they're hitting all the necessary portions. \n If I was only one person, it would take a lot of very careful planning--and planning more than a month at a time--in order to make $125/mo feasible.  Buying tiny packages of things is very pricey, but investing in the larger packages takes cashflow that the impoverished person doesn't have.  Buying a giant 36-pack of toilet paper is a luxury.  Buying it for $1/roll at the dollar store is much more expensive, but actually doable, for the person who never has enough room in their budget for the 36 pack.  Buying diapers is very expensive.  Using cloth diapers is cheap, but often forbidden by daycares, and, even worse, the start-up cost for cloth diapering is, oh, $150 or so.  For the cheaper kind, not the cadillac diapers.  So the person who can never come up with $150 spare in a month is stuck paying $40/mo for tiny packages of diapers, month after month, for three years.

            "Bah, I can't believe I'm even answering this.  If you read it, you will see.  If you know anything about the family at all. \n Okay, to begin, if you read the whole thing, there are two scripts to the interview which the investigator follows with little variation.  One script, is just information.  She doesn't ask if the child was touched, or if they feel safe.  She DOES talk about what is consider appropriate touching in the family.  For instance, there is an interview on p. 27 of someone, an older child, who was clearly NOT suspected to have been molested.  The investigator didn't do the little anatomical drawing that she did with every single molested child, and didn't ask if the child felt safe, as she did with every single molested child.  Second, there is an enormous amount of information here, recall--this is not the interview of a four-year-old. \n But the NEXT interview, p. 28-29, the investigator DOES follow the pattern for the for determining if the interviewee is molested or not.   She started out by drawing  with  the child, then producing a pre-done set of anatomical drawings, establishing the location of the \"Pee pee holder\" (remember, if this isn't the youngest daughter, then it's the interview of a teenager...), and then asking the same questions asked of the older molested children--did anyone touch  you  and do you feel safe now? \n There are five interviews of suspected molestation, and this is the one that ends with the child having no idea why they were even there, saying no one ever touched her, except for spankings, and the investigator being satisfied and ending the interview.  Your argument depends on the idea that the investigator chose to draw pictures with an older child and talk about \"pee pee holders.\"  This is the only child the investigator drew with, and the only time they use such childlike language.

The measure of religiosity/spirituality used was chosen because it measures a number of domains and therefore facilitates an analysis of this kind.

One more versed in Hebrew can explain its meaning better, but it is the word most commonly (exclusively?) translated as \"soul.\"  (It's also noteworthy that we read that Adam \"became\" a living soul.\") \n A similar story is Ezekiel 37 and the vision of the valley of the dry bones.  Now, I'm wary to take literally prophetic imagery, just as I'm wary to take literally verses found in Psalms and poetic imagery.  However, I think this is worth investigating: \n >The hand of the Lord was upon me, and He brought me out by the Spirit of the Lord and set me down in the middle of the valley; and it was full of bones.  He caused me to pass among them round about, and behold, there were very many on the surface of the valley; and lo, they were very dry.  He said to me, \u201cSon of man, can these bones live?\u201d And I answered, \u201cO Lord God, You know.\u201d  Again He said to me, \u201cProphesy over these bones and say to them, \u2018O dry bones, hear the word of the Lord.\u2019  Thus says the Lord God to these bones,  \u2018Behold, I will cause breath to enter you that you may come to life.   I will put sinews on you, make flesh grow back on you, cover you with skin and  put breath in you that you may come alive;  and you will know that I am the Lord.\u2019\u201d \n >So I prophesied as I was commanded; and as I prophesied, there was a noise, and behold, a rattling; and the bones came together, bone to its bone.  And I looked, and behold, sinews were on them, and flesh grew and skin covered them; but there was no breath in them.  Then He said to me, \u201cProphesy to the breath, prophesy, son of man, and say to the breath, \u2018Thus says the Lord God, \u201cCome from the four winds, O breath, and  breathe on these slain, that they come to life. \u201d\u2019\u201d So I prophesied as He commanded me, and  the breath came into them, and they came to life  and stood on their feet, an exceedingly great army. \n Emphasis added.  Again, this is a prophetic literature, so take it with a grain of salt.  For example, I'm not sure if Ezekiel was actually witnessing this happen, or if it was just in a vision.  That being said, what we see in this story is that the bones became bodies, but they were not alive.  They did not have breath in them. \n The Hebrew word that is used here is  ruach.   I'm not a Hebrew scholar so someone can better clarify, but from what I understand, this word is also translated as \"spirit.\"  This is a concept we also see in the Greek (which I am more familiar with).

Hs writes: \n >One may conclude \"This psalm does not concern me, because I have never been that angry.\" Such a response may be spoken as though it were a virtue, but I suggest it reflects someone who is only half living.

Who is justified in praying that way today?

It could be the voice of a black in South Africa (or here?) who has yet again been brutalized or humiliated by the system. Or it could be a Palestinian peasant weary of war, resentful of displacement. \n Lastly, imprecation also gives our anger over to God.  It is God's to avenge.

            "You're somewhat incorrect on both counts. \n This article is about natural helium. Natural He is about 1.4ppm 3He, the balance 4He. 3He is necessary for all extremely-low-temperature work using dilution refrigerators, and the fact that helium is rare in the first place (3He is functionally 5ppt in the atmosphere), combined with the fact that 3He is not chemically separable from 4He (since helium is the most unreactive element and forms no compounds by any reasonable definition), means that it is not economically sensible to separate 3He from 'commercial' natural He (which itself comes from the radioactive decay chain of U and Th in the earth's mantle, and is concentrated with other natural gas pockets). Furthermore, He is a light enough molecule that when it is released into the atmosphere, it disappears forever, off into space. If our radioactive elements hadn't been producing it for the history of the earth, we simply wouldn't have any on our planet. \n Natural helium is in a weird in-between zone between renewable and declining resources, which also puts it in a weird in-between zone for normal human economic considerations. It isn't like petroleum, that is a constantly decreasing resource but with large known and large theorized reserves that are accessible with some very slight changes in economics. It isn't like precious/rare metals, that are rare but both recyclable and available to be mined more of (both of these, again, given the proper economic incentive). It isn't like any other raw material that government and industry are used to regulating jointly, and that has led to some very odd behavior with America's National Helium Reserve, etc. \n To make a long story short, we are in 'short' supply of natural helium because it has many potential uses but has been sold at an artificially low price due to government mandate for a long time, but that's changing, so there is a perceived scarcity as the price is showing signs of heading in the direction of an actual free market rate (i.e.: up). \nIn addition, 3He is not realistically or economically separable from natural helium, so we actually produce it in 'breeder' nuclear reactors specifically and solely designed for the purpose, for example at the Mound site operated by Monsanto. In recent years, our main 3He source has been nuclear warhead disassembly- the isotopes specifically used in warhead construction produce a lot of 3He as a byproduct, so we harvest that. However, 3He is finding more extensive use in medical imaging technology and cold temperature research, and our need to disassemble warheads is slacking off, so without a huge investment in 3He production by high flux neutron bombardment in purpose-designed reactors, the price is likely to continue climbing. At it's current commercial price of somewhere around $2,000,000(!!!) per kilogram, the world's most expensive raw material (in my view), it is no wonder that dilution refrigerators have closed 3He recovery/recirculation systems built-in, losing only a small amount of the gas per use/unit time.

In a 2001 study at McGill University, researchers Anne Blood and Robert Zatorre recruited ten individuals who had at least some formal music training. Each participant selected a song that, they claimed, consistently gave them chills. The researchers played a 90-second excerpt of their chosen song while the subject laid in a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machine, a device that measures brain activity by detecting changes in blood flow. \n >Compared to control (neutral) sounds, music that elicits physical and emotional changes resulted in activation of limbic, paralimbic, and midbrain regions. These areas are implicated in pleasure and reward, not unlike the neural pathways that recognize yummy food, addictive drugs, and sex. \n Sure, this \"explains\" why people like music in the same way that a physiologist might explain why people run based on their increased heart rate. Yes, those things \"explain\" how the behaviors of liking music or running are possible, but when people say things like \"This explains why you like music!\" they don't mean \"Find out how the body is capable of being able to like music!\". \n The point being that people don't like music because areas of their brain are activated. That has the order of causality completely reversed. The activation of reward centres in the brain is the physical representation of the enjoyment we feel whilst listening to music we like. \n Neuroskeptic wrote on a similar topic a while ago (\"[Brain Scans Prove that the Brain Does Stuff]( and he came up with a brilliant description of the problem. If you're out in the woods and you suddenly become fearful, it's not because of activation in some part of your brain like your amygdala. It's because there is an angry looking bear charging towards you. \n It's basically a problem of conflating the psychological with the physical (not that the psychological is independent of the physical but it is undeniably not identical to it, in the sense that it's emergent from it), and confusing different levels of analysis/explanation.": "psychology",

You're right in that patriarchal systems are a result of a society dominated by men but it doesn't really make sense to say that men are to 'blame'. \n To describe it another way, 'patriarchy' is just the name for the type of society we currently live in.

In a discussion on neuroscience you claim that he's leaning on metaphysics and to support this you link to an article where he correctly debunks Hawking's ridiculous claim that physics makes metaphysics redundant. \n Importantly, he doesn't even make any metaphysical claims in that article, he just makes the basic point that science can't replace philosophy and metaphysics (which is obviously true). \n >He then goes on to bash on science quite a bit: \n >>Endeavours to unite them, such as string theory, are mathematically ingenious but incomprehensible even to many who work with them. \n How is that \"bashing\" science? \n >I'd think that you would appreciate this one, as you're pretty much telling me the incomprehensibility of this mans articles is my issue not his.

How much philosophy have you read up on? \n Rejecting materialism is  not  to suggest that there is anything other than the material in the world. \n >Clearly if we fail at \"identifying it with activity in the brain\", it doesn't fit in the material world eh? \n It's more that identifying it with the brain contradicts everything we know about neuroscience and psychology, meaning that it can't be true. \n >Matter \"reveals itself\"?

Not only am I not sure what this means, I have no idea what relevance it is that \"physics does not allow it\". \n He's referring to the fact that reducing levels of analysis down to physics and physical interactions ignores complex relations in higher order phenomena. \n >At best accepting this premise, all that means is that we have more to learn about physics, and I doubt anyone is going to deny that. \n No, you're still missing the point.

            "The trick to a planet having an atmosphere is that it must have a source of gas larger than its gas loss. \n To be clear, this can be either an outside source - captured from the surrounding gas cloud when the planet formed, as was the case for the gas giants like Jupiter - or an internal source - outgassing from volcanoes, as occurred for Venus and to some extent Earth. \n There are a few atmospheric loss mechanisms, but the most important is Jeans escape. At a given temperature, gas molecules that make up the atmosphere are constantly moving around. Some move a little faster, some move a little slower, but their speeds are distributed about some average speed. \n As you start to heat things up, these speeds start increasing. If it's hot enough, the fastest moving gas molecules will have a speed greater than the escape velocity of the planet, and so they can fly off into space, never to return. Eventually this effect will start eroding away at the planet's atmosphere as slow molecules starting moving faster, redistributing their speeds to compensate for the loss of the previous fastest ones. \n So, cold planets can hold on to their atmosphere more easily than hot planets. Additionally, the escape velocity is determined by the amount of gravity at the surface - so massive planets can hold onto their atmospheres more easily than less massive planets. \n A final important aspect of Jeans escape is that these molecular speeds go as the inverse square root of the mass of the molecule. In other words, at the same temperature, oxygen will move 4 times slower than hydrogen because oxygen is 16 times heavier than hydrogen. \n So if we put this all together, we can see why the planets have the atmospheres they do: \n \n Mercury: It's small (low surface gravity) and very close to the Sun (it's hot), so Jeans escape acts very strongly. There are no volcanoes to replenish the atmosphere. As a result, there's very little atmosphere - just a few sodium molecules that if you added them up, would have about the same mass as a Volkswagen Beetle. \n \n Venus: It's medium-sized (medium gravity) and close to the Sun (it's hot), so Jeans escape acts strongly. However, Venus has crazy volcanoes all over its surface...even though the atmospheric mass loss is big, the replenishment from volcanoes is really big. As a result, it has a very thick carbon dioxide atmosphere. Carbon dioxide is a heavy molecule (22 times heavier than hydrogen), so it has a difficult time escaping from the planet in spite of Venus' high temperature. \n \n Earth: It's medium-sized (medium gravity) and a medium distance to the Sun (it's temperate), so Jeans escape acts a fair amount. We have a good deal of volcanoes - but not as many as Venus - so we have a reasonably thick atmosphere. Note that there's good evidence that when the Earth was very young we used to have a hydrogen-rich atmosphere. Because the hydrogen molecule is so light, though, it quickly escaped into space, leaving behind the heavier nitrogen molecules. \n \n Mars: It's small (low surface gravity), but somewhat far from the Sun (it's somewhat cold), so again Jeans escape acts a fair amount. Mars almost certainly used to have a significant atmosphere - it had to for liquid water to exist, and we're fairly certain there were oceans at one time. The source was probably the many volcanoes we see on the surface...but they all went dormant a couple billion years ago. With no source for replenishment, Mars has lost almost all of its atmosphere, leaving a fossil atmosphere with only 1/200th the pressure of Earth's. It's mostly carbon dioxide with a a little argon - both heavy molecules, so the last to escape. \n \n Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune:  They're large (medium-to-high surface gravity), and very far from the Sun (it's very cold), so Jeans escape is very weak on these planets. Their replenishing gas source is also most of their mass - hydrogen and helium. They can hold onto these light molecules so well because Jeans escape is so weak. \n \n \n To answer your final question - a surface covered in water ice shouldn't matter too much, so long as there's something (such as volcanoes popping though ice sheet every so often) to replenish the atmosphere. There's good evidence that 700 million years ago Earth was [covered in ice sheets over the entire surface]( yet our atmosphere persisted.": "askscience",
            "Good question. This is because all the radioactive material (save, perhaps, a bit of tritium and radioactive lithium) was not made in the Big Bang, but in massive stars. \n All stars start out fusing hydrogen into helium using one or two different fusion reactions. As a massive star nears the end of its life, as it runs out of hydrogen it begins fusing heavier and heavier elements. Helium is fused to make carbon and oxygen. This is then fused to make silicon, and eventually fused into iron. Nothing heavier than iron can be fused to sustain the star's luminosity, because past this fusion becomes an endothermic reaction - it takes more energy than it produces. \n All of these steps can potentially produce radioactive elements along the way, but the mother-lode comes when the star finally goes supernova. Enough energy is released that in a matter of seconds every element past iron can be fused, including all the heavy radioactive elements we're familiar with (uranium, radon, thorium, etc), and dispersed across the universe to eventually wind up in planets and dogs and toaster-ovens. \n Furthermore, radioactive elements can be generated by interactions with cosmic rays. This happens here on Earth - a cosmic ray will interact with an atom in the atmosphere to produce carbon-14. This is actually how carbon-14 dating works...living things that are on the surface and interacting with atmosphere (e.g. breathing) will naturally have some carbon-14 in their composition. Once they're buried, the carbon-14 decays and is not replenished - thus we can tell how long ago it was buried.": "askscience",
            "Yes, it's totally feasible, provided that you are motivated enough. I had the advantage of already having a B.A. in the Natural Sciences (essentially a physics degree from a philosophy school) at 21, but I took a lot of time off to work in the corporate world, then started grad school at 28. I'm 36, and earned my PhD in astronomy last year. \n Here's my advice: \n \n Take as many Science/Math courses at a community college now. Get very good grades. \n \n As early as is possible, transfer to a reputable 4-year undergrad college. Most astronomy graduate departments won't give you a second glance if you apply to grad school straight from community college. \n \n Build meaningful relationships with your astronomy teachers early: come to office hours, discuss your plans with them, get good grades. After a semester or two, see if they have any research projects they would be willing to have you help with. This allows you to get both solid recommendations for grad school, as well as considerable research experience. \n \n As you are finishing up undergrad, do well on the Physics GRE and apply to grad schools. Bear in mind that your unconventional background may disqualify you from getting in to the top-top tier schools (Caltech, Harvard, etc.) - they already have a very specific idea of the sort of student they want to admit. That said, there are still plenty of very good astronomy grad departments out there...and to be honest, going to a not-quite-top grad school can often be better, as they tend to treat their grad students with more respect and not just TA fodder. \n \n \n Remember, you're at a slight disadvantage because of your background, not to mention the shock from a sudden drop in your income provided you've been gainfully employed these past several years. However, being slightly older gives you both the advantage that you know exactly why you're in school, as well as the motivation to achieve it. A lot of kids in undergrad and even grad school are there because they're not sure what else they would do.": "astrophysics",
            "Even without resolved pictures of it, we can state with certainty that Sedna is  not  a brown dwarf. \n We know from tracking Sedna's orbit how far away it is, and from photometry we know exactly how bright it is. Given these pieces of information and a reasonable estimate of its albedo (how reflective it is), we can make a reasonable estimate of its size. Our best estimate is that it's around 1500 km in diameter. \n If it turns out to have a higher albedo (more reflective) then it doesn't require as much surface area to produce the total amount of light we see, and so it's probably a bit smaller. Similarly, if it turns out to have a lower albedo (less reflective) then it requires a larger surface area to produce the total amount of light we see, and so it's probably a bit bigger. \n For Sedna to \"actually\" be the size of brown dwarf, it would have to be 10,000 times less reflective than we think it is...so pretty unlikely. Moreover, brown dwarfs emit a lot of infra-red light, which we definitely don't see from Sedna, and also don't have things like hydrocarbon ice, which we definitely do see from spectroscopic analyses of Sedna. Finally, if Sedna were a brown dwarf, it would be large enough that we would already be able to see it as more than just a point of light. \n To get an idea of what kind of telescopes could get pictures of Sedna, we need to think about resolving limits. If Sedna is 1500 km across, and its distance is 13 billion km, then its angular size from Earth is 0.02 arc-seconds. (There are 3600 arc-seconds in one degree of angle.)  In other words, we'd need a telescope with a resolving power of better than 0.02 arc-seconds in order to make Sedna look like more than just a single pixel. Ideally we want significantly more than this...a telescope with 0.01 arc-second resolving power would see Sedna as only 2x2 pixels, which is not a whole lot better. \n The absolute theoretical limit of resolving power for the Hubble Space Telescope is about 0.05 arc-seconds. If/when the James Webb Space Telescope launches, its theoretical limit of resolving power will be right around the 0.02 arc-second limit in visible wavelengths (though it won't observe very far into the visible, and resolution only gets worse as you go into infra-red). \n Although we can build larger telescopes on the ground, there we have the problem of dealing with the atmosphere mucking up our images...but adaptive optics can alleviate this problem somewhat. The proposed Thirty Meter Telescope (planned to be built in 2018, though that will probably slip) is aiming for a 0.01 arc-second resolution, so that's probably the first time that we'd be able to directly resolve Sedna, though just barely.": "askscience",
            "Right, this is a tough one. Jupiter has no \"surface\" to land on the way the terrestrial planets do. The atmosphere keeps getting thicker and thicker as one descends further. At some point, hydrogen gets dense enough that it starts acting more like a liquid than a gas (technically, it's a supercritical fluid at this point), eventually getting ever thicker until it becomes a solid. This isn't anything you could land a rover on, though, since the pressures are much too large for any machinery to work. \n While entering orbit around Jupiter, the Galileo spacecraft dropped a probe into the atmosphere, taking measurements as it fell. It kept returning data until it reached a pressure 22 times that which we experience here on Earth. That said, that really wasn't any kind of \"extended mission\" like the kind you're asking about. \n The recent proposals I've heard at conferences for long-term probes on gas giant planets are usually some kind of very advanced weather balloon. With proper design, we could drop a probe into the the planet's atmosphere that would then inflate a balloon, using its buoyancy to allow it to linger in the atmosphere wherever we chose. I've also heard the idea for an airplane thrown about, but that's a lot tougher, engineering-wise. \n Obviously a manned version of either balloon or airplane would be much more difficult. We'd have to provide life support for over a decade (it takes at least 5 years to get to Jupiter, and then there's the return trip), which adds a great deal of mass to the spacecraft. It's also somewhat questionable what a manned mission could do on the planet that couldn't be accomplished by a robotic mission.": "askscience",
            "Okay, there's a good deal of speculation here presented as fact. Please allow me set the record straight. \n From the most widely held theory, we  think  there should be a rocky core at the center of gas giant planets, but we currently have no observational evidence to back this up. This all depends on how you assume these planets form. \n The most popular theory of gas giant formation is that dust grains in the disc surrounding the primordial Sun began to stick and form \"planetesimals\", small rocky bodies the size of asteroids. These began to grow in size by clumping together due to gravity, eventually forming decently-sized rocky planets. If you have a rocky planet that's ~5 Earth-masses and in a part of the disc that has a lot of gas, the planet can begin accreting a lot of gas that cannot escape the planet's relatively strong gravitational pull. This process would eventually form a gas giant with a rocky core. \n The alternate theory here is \"gas collapse\" - it's possible that the gas itself in the primordial disc (and not the dust) is slightly clumpy and will begin to collapse from its own self-gravity with no need for planetesimals as seeds. This would form gas giants without cores. \n Although there are some reasons to prefer the planetesimal theory, we really don't have enough evidence to rule out the gas collapse theory at this time. Moreover, we have very little idea about how big that core actually is - I've seen theories ranging anywhere from 5 to 40 Earth-masses for Jupiter's core mass. \n We'll know a lot more about this in 2015 when the Juno spacecraft arrives at Jupiter. It will begin a series of very tight orbits around the planet, picking up very tiny gravitational changes that should allow us to probe deep density variations. It should not only be able to confirm the presence of a core, but also how massive it is.": "askscience",
            "Note that H2O has a smaller molecular weight than O2 and is relatively more concentrated at the surface. \n You're looking at the right graph, but you're interpreting it wrong. The reason for H2O's higher concentration near the surface has nothing to do with molecular weight. It's simply because the water saturation pressure is lower for colder air - in colloquial terms, cold air can \"hold\" less water than warm air. \n With the reservoir for water at the surface, water vapor will saturate the air above it as a function of that air's temperature. Since the temperature decreases with altitude (at least for the lower atmosphere), that saturation drops with height, so any excess upwelling water vapor will form clouds and rain out. \n If our atmosphere were the same temperature at all heights, water vapor would be evenly mixed up to a height of ~90 km, just like O2 and CO2. This is because that's where the [homopause]( is found - where the eddy diffusion coefficient is the same as the molecular diffusion coefficient - and is the same reason that CO2 and O2 are evenly mixed to roughly that same height. \n In plain English, the answer to OP's question - the reason CO2 and O2 are evenly mixed, at least up to 90km - is simply that the force of different density gases trying to separate out is just much weaker than effect of atmospheric turbulence keeping them evenly mixed. This is the case up until you get to the upper atmosphere, at which point turbulence starts getting very weak, and gases will separate by density above that height. \n Of course, in very localized conditions when a gas is very dense and the air is very still, you can still get density gradients...this is why you can potentially get a build-up of radon gas in your basement.": "askscience"

            "First, it's a little unclear which type of revolution you're talking about: the Earth's orbital motion around the Sun, or the revolution of the planet about it's access. Since you mention a day/night cycle, and because it's more interesting, I'll assume you're talking about the former. The short answer is: very bad things. The long answer follows, and was fun to explore. I'll present this in the style of an xkcd what if, but without all the citations. Numbers are from Google, random comparisons from Wolfram-Alpha. \n To begin, the Earth's orbital motion about the sun is suddenly halted. I will not ask how you found the prerequisite 2.664*10^27 Megajoules of energy needed to cancel out the Earth's kinetic energy around the sun. (Note: this is approximately 1/5 the sun's annual energy output, or the energy output of a mass of TNT approximately 1% the size of the sun!) I will also, out of respect, not ask how you did this without destroying everything on the planet, or asking where the energy left. I'll assume no changes to the Earth. \n Initially, there would be little change. All people and buildings on the Earth stay bound to it, and I'll assume don't notice whatever change stopped the Earth's motion, and are unaffected by the acceleration. The first thing that would get noticed is all of our satellites are now moving at their original orbital speed, plus the almost 30 km/sec velocity of the Earth around the sun (relative to us). All satellites that were behind the Earth smack into it almost instantly, while others fly off into the void. Geosynchronous satellites form a nice line of meteors about 20 minutes later, landing across the equator. \n The next major change is that the moon is now moving well past it's needed escape velocity, and begins to leave the Earth's sphere of influence and orbit the sun as an independent body. It's final orbit around the sun will depend on where it was in it's orbit when the Earth stopped moving, and I don't want to calculate what it's final orbit looks like, so I won't. It's possible, if this happened at the wrong time (or maybe the best time) that the moon could impact the Earth, but I'll assume that doesn't happen. This would, needless to say, be a bad thing. \n While the Earth has stopped, it is still under the same force of gravity as before. It will begin to fall towards the sun. Because it is going to travel a long distance (I'll round to 150 million kilometers), the gravitational acceleration will change significantly from start to finish, so we can't use generic kinematic equations that assume constant acceleration. Instead, I solved the differential velocity equation in matlab, and found some interesting results. \n When the Earth begins it's decent, it starts accelerating at the rapid pace of almost 6 cm/second (note: sarcasm). The sun is very far away, and gravity isn't really that strong of a force. After one minute, the Earth has fallen just over 100 meters, and is falling at a rate slightly higher than 3.5 meters per second. Very exciting. \n But, things do move pretty quickly. After 30 minutes of falling, the Earth has moved 100 km, and is moving at around 100 m/s, around the speed of a Ferrari. After 12 hours, Earth has fallen around 55000 km, and is moving over 2.5 km/s. \n By the time Earth reaches Venus' orbit, during day 13 of the fall, it is moving around 83 km/s. The sun appears much brighter in the sky, and the planet will probably begin to warm several degrees per day. Things move quickly from here on out. The shape of the radiation environment around Earth is beginning to change due to a much larger impact from the solar wind. \n When we pass Mercury, barely 5 days (!) later, we are moving at over 167 km/s. By now, aurora are visible across the planet, as highly energetic particles from the solar wind punch through the magnetosphere and impact on the upper atmosphere. These effects also begin to strip off parts of our atmosphere, which will form a very beautiful, comet like trail behind us. These are nice backdrops for the inevitable complete destruction of Earth. \n By around 20 and 1/2 days, less than 72 hours after passing Mercury, the planet reaches the sun's corona (which I assume to be extend around 1.5 solar radii above the sun's surface). Earth is moving at the decidedly brisk pace of 1,228 km/sec. Highly energetic ionized gasses tear into the planet, destroying any vestige of the atmosphere and water that may remain. Some of the rock begins to boil off as well. The magnetosphere, if it remains, will be ripped apart, as the field lines are consumed by those of the sun. The planet is now essentially a very large asteroid. \n As it plunges further down into the atmosphere of the sun, the crust facing the sun will begin to liquefy, turning molten. Assuming there is negligible drag on the planet during this part of the fall (a very bad assumption), Earth will reach final velocities nearing 2000 km/s, or around .5% the speed of light, before finally plunging into the sun's chromosphere and being completely destroyed. This occurs after only a few dozen minutes after entering the corona. The effects of dropping an Earth size body on the sun are not completely understood, or particularly widely studied for some reason. My guess would be a well sized sunspot would appear, probably for several weeks. The tail of material blown off from the Earth continues to fall towards the sun, and is eventually engulfed as well.": "askscience",
            "Imagine you have a jet of water shooting out of a hose. If you shoot it down, or otherwise ignore gravity, it will move in a straight line away from the faucet. If you hold it at an angle, it will move along that same path. If you then rotate it, in a conical manner around a central axis, what sort of pattern will you get? \n The water won't form a cone. It can't, because it's coming from a single point source. Instead, it will 'spiral' around the cone; each piece of water moves in a straight line away from it's source, but the source rotates around a central axis. It's important to note that none of the water will move in a classical vortex, or have circular motion. The only thing making the pattern is the linear motion of water leaving the spout, and rotational motion provided by the spout itself. If you were rotating with the source, you would see a straight line flow with no rotation. It's sort of the foil of a barber's spiral, where every piece is only rotating, but the cumulative effect is (purely visual) linear motion. Instead, we have purely linear motion from each bit of water that accumulates into a (purely visual) spiral pattern. \n Now, imagine that the point of water represents magnetic north, and the empty side opposite the spout on the imaginary cone is magnetic south. Add a gradient between the two, and you've made a spiral magnetotail. It's not that the field is spiraling around like a vortex; it's that it is being pushed out by the solar wind in a linear fashion from a source that's rotating. See [the picture here](  The central axis of the spiral is determined by a mix of the effects of the planet's rotation, the oncoming solar wind, and the offset of the magnetic field. The speed the spiral is rushing away from the planet at is determined by 'friction' between it and the solar wind, and it's period is determined by the period of the planet. \n This is of course a highly simplified view, planetary magnetohydrodynamics being a fairly vigorous subject to approach on an internet forum. If we try and approach the problem from a theory or modelling standpoint, we get bogged down pretty quickly just setting up the dynamics, which happens just as soon as we finish coupling Maxwell's equations with the fluid dynamics problem of the solar wind. For obvious reasons, I'll just leave a fairly interesting [source]( and move on. If you get overwhelmed like I did, just skip to the conclusion for all the fun bits.": "askscience",
            "Edit : Wow, this turned pretty long. Didn't mean to do that going in, but I got sidetracked thinking about the specifics of designing this system. \n First off, it's great that you're working on this. It's some really cool tech. But as someone from the space industry, the implementation of this sort of technology has a huge number of probably unexpected problems that I think deserve to be brought up. \n Let's look at what this technology gets you. As the article mentions, the biggest benefit is the reduction in food consumption. But that doesn't mean you get rid of the need for food entirely. You'll still need food, water, clothing, etc. for the six month stay on Mars, for anyone living on the ship in orbit (the crew will absolutely need a week or two of in space time awake before each planetary arrival/departure), and so on. So you don't lose the need for ECLSS, food facilities, hygiene, or exercise equipment. \n In addition, if there is an emergency, and the crews need to be awake for some or all of the journey,  they will still need all of their food . What if the astronauts encounter a problem entering tupor after their sojourn on Mars? What if there is a leak of saline, and one or more of the astronauts needs to be brought out of stasis? There are now a string of single point failures available that require standard life support equipment as mitigation. \n Does it help with the biggest life support issue of all: radiation? I don't see why it would. Perhaps the effects won't be as dramatic, but it certainly won't remove the need for radiation protection entirely. So, in general, all of the crew life support systems will need to be at least provisionally in place if there were a failure in the system. \n Now, let's look at the other costs of this system. On top of doing the R&D for this (not negligible), you now have a huge added technological trial on the critical path towards full Mars mission capabilities. You need to design and test a version of this system that can be operated by the intended patients, fly demonstration units in space and test they work appropriately, and have astronauts operate it effectively themselves outside of most Earthly influence. Can this be done? Yes. Is it easy or quick? Absolutely not. \n What are the added risks of operating this system in space? Is gravity used to help feed any of the intravenous liquids into the human body? If so, you need a working fluid to pressurize the system that won't kill the astronauts if it leaks into the system and enters their bodies. Now, you need to redesign the feed system with the working fluid, and test that in microgravity. You've also just introduced a highly pressurized liquid into the life support loop, and in direct contact with the human body. And all of the intravenous lines are pressurized. This is an incredibly large engineering struggle to prove safe. I really cannot overstate how much of an issue this is. \n Can patients remove themselves and adequately recover without an attending physician in the course of a few days? If not, a crew member will need to remain awake the whole trip, completely neglecting some of the potential benefits. If it is the case, then crews will have to test the system by remaining in stasis (probably in the ISS) for many weeks, awaking sans issues, and returning to flight ready status on their own. \n Time in space is not cheap. These astronauts could be performing life saving medical research, or scientific frontier expanding technical research during the trip. Or during the test runs on the ISS. This is a huge, huge loss to the scientific community. Every hour in space is precious. Think of the loss if an entire ISS expedition slept the whole time. Now, double that, because the Mars crews will spend twice that amount of time in space. \n As others have pointed out, atrophy is a huge issue. But no one's pointed out the full extent of the problem. Not only are you suffering microgravity induced bone loss, muscle atrophy, and intracranial pressure, you now have to deal with the inability of your astronauts to actively fight these problems. Is any solution offered? Artificial gravity is another huge cost; tethers are exceedingly tricky from a stability and dynamics standpoint, and both tethers and spinning wheels add another huge cost and technical hurdle on the critical path. \n What are the inherent costs of the system? Mass? Electricity? You obviously can't turn off the ECLSS system completely while they're in torpor lest any issues arise, so you don't gain too much benefit there. What else is being displaced by these systems physically? Since most of the other equipment on vehicle will still be needed, what will probably need to happen is that scientific equipment will be left on the wayside. This is unfortunate in the extreme, bordering on unacceptable. \n Now, this is pretty negative, so I'll reiterate: this is great, cool work. That's why it was \"explored\" by a technical study. That's what NASA does. It explores options. Is this something that should be looked at for exploration beyond Mars? Yes, in great detail. But don't expect the first astronauts on Mars to go to sleep for the trip.": "EverythingScience",

I'm incredibly lucky to have gotten to where I am. \n But I also ended up with a career that I absolutely love, and working on a project that is really, really cool right out of college. That's the one constant I find with all my friends I went to school with. We all do amazing things, because in the aerospace world, everything is amazing. If you're building unique satellites, testing rockets, developing safer planes, or studying unique aerodynamic or material problems in a lab, you're doing something really cool in my book. \n I would absolutely recommend a career in industry. There's more than one way to get there. I think the people you talked to are well intentioned, and what they meant to say was this: major in something general, and seek out career opportunities in aerospace. There's a lot of merit to this approach, and in many ways it makes you a more flexible engineer and provides safer career opportunities. But if you know that you want to work in aerospace, there's no reason not to go for that degree. \n There's a lot of people who are going to be retiring soon, and there's going to be a lot of opportunity in four or five years to work on some pretty neat stuff.

If you can't vouch for the safety of your product, and if you aren't confident in the quality of the build, why should anyone else be? \n You clearly have some reservation regarding a launch, or you wouldn't have posted. But the post doesn't say what, exactly, you're worried about. I'd think long and hard about what your reservations are, and what you've done to mitigate any likely failures. Basically, if you were to take the rocket up to an RSO, could you justify the decisions you've made throughout the entire process? If the answer is no, then you need to make some serious changes to your rocket. \n On a personal level, I would never fly a home made motor with a rocket I had not already flown at least once with a professionally made motor. In my opinion, you need that flight history to actually validate the rocket's design and flight worthiness. This goes double for a home built (ie, not a kit or professional parts) rocket. \n There are some aspects of your rocket's design that look particularly troublesome, but not having any additional pictures or knowledge of how the rocket's put together, it's hard to say for sure which are deal breakers.

I'm really skeptical of an 5 mile apogee on a 3 pound rocket, no matter how much fuel there is. You're burn profile is almost certainly not constant at max thrust, so that's probably where the problem is. I'd also expect a much higher Cd than 0.5 from a rocket with a nosecone like that. \n While I don't think I'd fly the rocket as is, there's certainly things you could do to improve safety fairly easily.

It limits the freedom you have with the design, creates a lot of headaches for the people who have to build brand new model T doors, and doesn't save much over just building something from scratch. \n There's several major problems with 'just using proven technology'. First off, just because it's been proven to work for a different vehicle doesn't mean it will work for yours. You still need to perform all of the systems verification work (making sure the components will function properly with your system) you would need on a new system, which is not a small amount of work. Second, because you're taking old things and recreating them again, you need to go through all the old parts involved and do a bunch of stuff. You need to make sure it's still manufacturable; this boils down to bringing the standards up to date, which means reperforming all the part level verifications with new standards and passing them through the design chain. In many cases, it's far easier to design a part from scratch than take something old and revalidate it, unless it performs some sort of highly specialized function. \n Next, let's look at what sort of systems there are in a rocket. There's the obvious structural systems, propulsion, and avionics. But those are just the high profile systems. Things like tubing, feedlines, inert gas systems, hazgas purge, bleed lines, fill and drain lines, wiring and sensor equipment, and TPS/thermal shielding will together take up most of your design and verification work. Those systems will all be unique to the vehicle, and will need to be designed from scratch. Then, even if you reuse major hardware, your vehicle will operate in a new environment. All your old hardware will need to be analysed through the new flight envelope, have loads definitions drawn up, and go through the same analysis and verification as your new systems. Since old systems can't be tweaked during this process, getting them to show good if they are subject to a unique or unexpected load they weren't originally designed for can be horribly difficult. \n Moving on, it's never simple to just add new computers, or add new anything, to a rocket. Everything about the computers will need to be analyzed. Can the interface with the control equipment? Do they have the right mass and material properties? Do they have the right attachment fittings, or will a new shelf need to be designed? Any new equipment will need to be reanalyzed completely, then the surrounding components and the vehicle will need to go through the same work to make sure there's no changes to the environment.": "explainlikeimfive"

            "The best way to reduce Auger recombination is to reduce electron density in the junction.  It is possible to add more junctions in parallel but that increases die cost and doesn't solve the issue.  This droop phenomena occurs 'too soon' or at an unexpectedly low current based on our experience.  It would be nice to be able to increase current and light emission without increasing area.  Another way to reduce electron density in the junction is to widen the junction.  Herein lies the rub with III-N materials. \n The interesting thing about GaN (used in this work) is the way it is grown.  GaN is typically grown on a polar face of the crystal.  This is just a side effect of the growth physics of GaN in MOCVD.  Think of the semiconductor like layers of gallium alternating with layers of nitrogen.  In this toy model, the electronegativity difference between gallium and nitrogen means one pulls the electron more strongly.  As a consequence, the electron wants to be more on one side so it creates an electric field.  Such an electric field bends the bands in the quantum well and effectively shrinks the available junction width.  Some groups (including those at UCSB and Soraa) are using semi-polar and non-polar faces of the crystal to try and reduce this effect.  If the crystal polarization were eliminated, the QW could be made thicker and current density reduced.  On the other hand, a big contributor to QW  bending is strain.  There isn't an affordable native substrate for III-N materials so tricky growth techniques are employed to try and reduce strain.  Good silicon epitaxy has ~10-100 defects per square centimeter while good GaN epitaxy has 10^6 - 10^8 defects per square centimeter.

            "I started typing out a really long story but realized I could summarize it briefly:  Silicon is good enough and affordable enough already.  That means it's just a  scaling  issue more for manufacturing engineers than materials and electrical engineers.  Expect silicon panel prices to come back up and level off around $0.50/Watt as Chinese subsidies are discontinued and polysilicon prices return to stability. \n The rest of the price is the Balance Of System (BOS) costs.  That means shipping, wiring, labor, tracking, inverting, structural supports etc.  These items typically are around 50% of the installed costs.  It is very tough for an alternative material to match the low price and decent performance of silicon.  There is also a  LOT  of silicon around so producing a metric butt-ton (butt-ton == 100,000 tons) annually is totally reasonable. \n It comes down to a value proposition for the other materials and other players.  CdTe isn't as available as silicon and the costs/efficiency don't match up.  CIGS is in a similar boat with companies like NanoSolar recently going under.  Even the most expensive materials like GaAs (think Alta Devices) aren't cost competitive.  The additional performance is nice but they have a big challenge ahead of them to make their substrates reusable 1000X.  Otherwise, it's just going to go away. \n Lastly, progress is always being made in silicon to make it cheaper or more efficient.  You probably won't get to the SQ limit with silicon but you can do pretty well AND do it affordably.  One of the most interesting contributors to that is really big silicon furnaces that grow big poly-Si such that any one piece is mostly single crystal.  A neat trick for cost reduction.

Regardless of the exact amount of light, it is impossible to get more power out of a system than is put into it.  The main purpose of solar concentration is to reduce the required area of a photovoltaic cell.  There is a slight boost in efficiency under concentrated illumination but let's ignore that for now. \n Here's the roughest (read: simple) version of a solar cell and why it is limited to 33% efficiency... The incident white light is a blackbody spectrum over a broad range of energies from infrared to UV.  The solar cell typically has one bandgap energy.  That means you shine a broadband source onto a fixed bandgap cell.  When a photon hits a solar cell, it can produce an exciton pair at its own energy.  UV photons have more energy (~3eV) than infrared (~1eV or less).  If the bandgap of a cell is 1eV, all photons with energy less than 1eV will pass through.  All photons with energy over 1eV can create an electron hole pair.  If a 3eV photon hits the cell, that extra 2eV is wasted as 'heat'.  That means a cell is only optimized for a single wavelength.  Infrared photons pass right through and the excess energy of blue photons is wasted.  These are the main reasons a cell is limited to around 33%. \n There are other limitations to high concentration cells that I'd be happy to discuss for others interested in the semiconductor physics but this should hit the basics.  There are good reasons we don't use silicon in concentrator cells but those are best left for another topic.": "askscience",

            "There are two main types of uncooled infrared imagers.  Let's refer to them as  green  and  white .  The  green  imagers directly amplify near infrared photons and is what we typically think of when we think of soldiers wearing infrared.  The  white  imager is an array of temperature sensitive resistors instead of a direct imager.  This  white  image is what we think of when a helicopter chases down a fugitive on Cops. \n Of the two main types of uncooled infrared detectors, I am most familiar with  white  or those used for mid wave infrared (MWIR).  This ~10um wavelength is important because it is the wavelength of light a 300K blackbody emits.  Essentially, it is very suited to imaging humans.  My experience is in process development of the active material, vanadium oxide or VOx, used in these detectors. \n The  white  imager detectors are called microbolometers and you can imagine this as an array of pixels.  Each pixel is a little bridge coated with a temperature sensitive material.  When infrared light hits the material, it heats up and changes resistance.  A read-out circuit then converts those changes in resistance to an image.  These detectors are expensive because the material is 'hard' to grow and the its use is restricted under ITAR (International Traffic in Arms Regulations).  They also need to be packaged in a vacuum which adds cost. \n The  green  imager detectors are usually a variation of an image intensifier tube.  Essentially, photons are converted into electrons on one end and accelerated down a tube biased to high voltage.  When electrons hit the side walls, they knock off additional electrons that cascade to create a much larger signal.  Those amplified electrons are then converted into an image.  Modern military gear uses a micro-channel plate which looks like a very thin piece of honeycomb.  Each channel is analogous to an image intensifier tube.  These are expensive because of the active coating on the tube and the machining to make the tube.  Lots of active research is going into improving their performance with different coatings to prevent solar persistence etc. \n Ultimately, to answer your earlier question, these active detectors are only a part in a big system.  They require optics in front to focus the incoming photons onto the small detector, electronics to process the image, and a display to create the image.  All these devices are also planar so any curved display like snowboarding goggles would require an array of detectors.  The science is all there to make a bulky solution with wide FOV but it would be VERY expensive.": "askscience",
            "There are actually only a few places and a small group of people in the entire world that know how to grow the active materials for these infrared detectors.  This will probably get buried since the post disappeared but those involved will at least get more of the picture.  As one of those people who developed the technological process (not a FLIR employee), I can tell you some of the reasons why thermal is expensive. \n Most of the MWIR sensors that are available for government use are made of vanadium oxide.  This has been a government requirement for uncooled detectors that are sensitive around the 10um range.  The technique for growing good VOx was developed by a guy named Woods whose data has never quite been replicated.  That is, no one has matched the high temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR) that the original work did.  That work has been licensed out to several defense contractors and there are a few labs and small companies continuing that tradition. \n Why is it expensive?  VOx is actually quite toxic when inhaled so the vacuum chambers have to be maintained carefully.  Conventional VOx is deposited with a VERY expensive deposition technique that is more commonly used for read/write heads in hard drives.  This Ion Beam Sputtering technique creates very dense films but it is very slow and the process control isn't particularly good.  It could definitely be made better and cheaper so if someone with money wants to know how... \n Anyways, the other major alternative material is amorphous silicon (a-Si).  Amorphous silicon can be produced in a conventional fab and processed more easily without secondary partners or exotic tooling like VOx.  The two materials have different TCR as well as different Noise Equivalent Temperature Dependence (NETD).  These are the figures of merit and matching the performance of VOx with a-Si is tough.  It's certainly possible that a-Si can improve to match that of VOx and FLIR has been doing a good job doing that.": "askscience",

            "There's no need for them to be orthogonal, but there is an associated convenience that you already mentioned: that when you move along one coordinate axis, you're not moving along any of the others. \n But this isn't really the key to what orthogonality means, as it turns out. If you're familiar with the dot product, you know that any orthogonal vectors have a vanishing dot product. More generally, we can define [inner products]( on spaces, and then  define  orthogonality to mean that the inner product vanishes. \n This definition of orthogonality is neat because it allows you to express vectors in orthogonal bases with ease: each component is just the inner product of the vector with the unit vector corresponding to that component. For example, with the dot product, you can find the  x -coordinate of any vector by dotting it with (1,0,0), which is the unit vector corresponding to the  x -component. \n Let's formalize. In general, if  e^i  is the  i th unit vector, and  v  is some vector in the space, then  i th component of  v  is given by \n v^i  = ( e^i ,  v ) \n where ( a , b ) is the inner product of  a  and  b . This only works if all of the  e^i  are mutually orthogonal; we can talk about why if you like. \n This more abstract statement is applicable to much more than just the dot product. For instance, you might be familiar with Fourier series, where you can break up any function into a sum of sines and cosines. This seems like a crazy idea at first, but what makes it all tick is an inner product on the space of functions, together with the fact that the sines and cosines form a basis in that space. Under this inner product, all of the sines and cosines are mutually orthogonal, so to find the coefficient for each term in the series, all you have to do is to take the inner product of your \"vector\" (function) with each of the sine and cosine functions. That's what a Fourier series / transform actually  is \u2014rewriting a function in the basis of sines and cosines using the inner product to find the components.": "AskScienceDiscussion",
            "You've gotten some good answers already, and I want to emphasize the point that one can't really think of science as an endeavor to benefit society. In fact, there are those who would argue that science has done more harm than good. While some subfields of science are closely tied to practical application, they universally rely heavily on fields that were developed with no direct application in mind. The same can be said for much of modern mathematics: there's just a long delay between developing something fundamental and finding an everyday purpose for it. \n But to answer your question directly: \n > Are there any practical reasons for studying the origin of the universe? Will studying the universe and its origin aid in the advancement of science/man? Are the theories about the origin of the universe beneficial to science? \n Some say that we need to understand the universe around us to prepare for the long-term survival and propagation of the human species. They might be right, but there's a much more immediate reason to study the universe: it's a unique laboratory. \n Let me put it this way. The advancement of human society is inextricably tied to our understanding of physics. Figure out fire, and we're kept warm. Figure out electrons, and we have electricity. Figure out radiation, and we have radio communication. Figure out the quantum mechanical behavior of particles, and we have modern computers. You get the idea. \n But our understanding of such physics is tied completely to the  energy scales  we can attain to study these phenomena. You would never discover fire if you didn't have a way to get tinder hot; you would never figure out electrons if you didn't have a cathode of sufficient energy; you would never understand radiation if you didn't have sufficiently strong current sources; you wouldn't be able to test quantum theories without a particle accelerator. \n We keep pushing the limits of the energy scales we can probe, and that's what leads to advancements in fundamental physics. For example, we recently discovered the Higgs because the LHC probed a new energy scale. We have  no idea  what we might discover at higher energy scales. (Actually, we have lots of ideas, but they need to be tested.) \n So here's the problem: if we want to understand fundamental physics, and discover the next electron, we need incredibly high energy scales. We need energy scales higher than you could get by turning the whole planet into a particle accelerator. So I guess we'll just never understand these things. Bummer. \n But wait! There are lots of objects in the universe (including the structure of the universe itself) that are tightly connected to such energy scales. In particular, the early universe is absolutely unique: we'll never get energy scales like that ever again. If we can look back and understand what the universe was like in the first moments after the big bang,  we can learn things about fundamental physics . \n As it turns out, we don't even have to look to the early universe to see completely new phenomena.

            "You've gotten some good answers here, but I want to devote a few more words to the expansion of space, just to give an introduction to some of the concepts. The expansion of space is [metric expansion]( and is thus described with [general relativity]( \n Before we go into that, though, let's briefly review [special relativity]( In special relativity, all inertial frames are equivalent, so the speed of light is the same as measured by every inertial observer. This has certain consequences for the structure of spacetime: in particular, spacetime in special relativity must have a [Minkowskian]( rather than Euclidean geometry. This can be thought of as the core content of special relativity\u2014if you postulate that spacetime is Minkowskian, you can derive all the rest. \n Next, before we make the jump to general relativity, let's familiarize ourselves with the basic picture of a [manifold]( A manifold is a generalization of a surface that relies on one important property: wherever you are on the manifold, if you look at a very small neighborhood around you, it will look very nearly Euclidean. For example, even though the earth's surface is curved, it looks flat when we look at the small areas in our field of view. If you like, you can imagine a flat plane that just touches a manifold at one point; then very near that point, the manifold and the plane will look almost the same. Thus, it's like you have a different Euclidean space centered at each point. This is related to the concept of a [tangent space]( we'll come back to that later. \n Okay, now we're ready for general relativity! In GR, we model the universe as a manifold, with one twist: instead of having a  Euclidean  space at each point, we have a  Minkowskian  space at each point. What this means is that if you only look in a very small neighborhood around yourself, the universe will look like it obeys special relativity! That includes the usual limitations on the speed of light. Thus, special relativity still works in a  local  sense: you'll never see anything run right past you faster than light. \n But what we also learn from this is that it's very difficult to compare observations at different points. Remember, different points have different Minkowskian spaces\u2014different tangent spaces. That means that observers at different points have different notions of time and space. How do you add or subtract velocities between observers who are displaced on the manifold? Somewhat frustratingly, the answer is that you can't. Strictly speaking, quantities like velocity are only defined as elements of the tangent space, which means they are only defined  locally . My velocity is only defined where I am, and not where you are. \n Now, there's a whole lot of complication about ways to transport vectors between different points on the manifold, but the takeaway point is that it's not even trivial to define your distance to another point in a curved space, let alone your relative velocity. Such things are really only defined locally. When we say that things are moving away from us faster than the speed of light, we're taking some liberties with language. We're really selecting a particular definition of relative velocity and saying that  for that definition,  the velocity calculated exceeds the velocity that one would locally measure for light. An actual ray of light passing by such an object would travel even \"faster\". \n Thus, the meaning of the speed-of-light limit becomes much more complicated in GR. One of the more well-defined aspects of this question regards the existence of  closed timelike curves  The possible existence of CTCs is incompletely understood; while the equations of GR allow them in principle, we do not know whether these solutions are realizable or observable.

First is P(reject|real), which we call the  power  of the test, and the second is P(reject|false), the rate of false positives, or type 1 errors.  Let's assume that the author is assuming that the P=.01 is being used as the probability of making a type 1 error.  Then, we have: \n .30= .05\u2022P(reject|real)/[.05\u2022P(reject|real) + .95\u2022.01] \n Solving for the Power of the test gives me .0814.  That is a pretty weak test!": "statistics",
            "Most> Economists argue that the value of something is what people are  willing  to pay for it. Don't get that confused with what the market price is: I might be  willing  to spend $2,000 for someone to write some computer code for me.  The fact that someone has already done it and posted it on their website for free does not make it valueless. If we simply assume that the labor theory of value says that the value of something is a function of the amount of labor it takes to create it (and even when you go deeper than that, the theory doesn't get any better), let me give you a few counter examples to show you how the amount of labor that goes into something is largely irrelevant to the value. \n 1) Suppose there is a piece of wood sitting on the ground.  If we just leave it there for 3 years, perhaps it changes color, and people think it is more beautiful, and willing to pay more for it.  Therefore, its value has increased, and no one did anything. \n 2) Suppose this artist you refer to has this $1,000 piece you refer to.  But next week, that art either a) Gets more fashionable and is now worth $2,000, or b) Goes out of fashion, and is now worthless.  Labor has nothing to do with the change in value. \n 3) How much do you value clean air?  Or beautiful scenery in a forest?  How much do you value the quality of life of a Polar Bear, and value that he shouldn't have to see oil wells in ANWAR?  How much would you value NOT having a wind turbine whooshing over your house? Again, labor has nothing to do with these things, and yet we value them, and are willing to pay (or give up things) to see that nature, the air, and the environment are preserved. \n 4) Last point: Think of all of the things that labor does that has no value, or negative value.  The student's argument on a math problem: \"But I worked so HARD on it!\" Well, it is still wrong. I often spend many months on a research question, to run into a dead end.  No one values that.

Gosset used the divisor n, not the modern (n - 1), when he estimated s and his z is proportional to t with t = z \ufffd(n - 1). Fisher introduced the t form for it fitted in with his theory of degrees of freedom. Fisher's treatment of the distributions based on the normal distribution and the role of degrees of freedom was given in \"On a Distribution Yielding the Error Functions of Several well Known Statistics,\" Proceedings of the International Congress of Mathematics, Toronto, 2, 805-813. The t symbol appears in this paper but although the paper was presented in 1924, it was not published until 1928 (Tankard, page 103; David, 1995).

            "I hope I'm not too late to the party but I feel like there needs to be a few things cleared up here. \n First, anthropologists already know that pre-hominid  homo  species made tools.  Homo habilis  was named the 'handy man'. [Check the wiki link]( \n Seriously guys, this is anthro 100. After Habilis' came and went, there were still more stone tools. Check out some of the [Acheulean technology]( Those things lasted from 1.7 million to about 100,000 years ago. \n So why is this article interesting? \n The title is misleading (not that OP meant to, of course)- the skills the researchers are talking about are about  projectile tools . There has long been a debate about when hominid species learned to tie pointy rocks to sticks and throw them. This is some seriously, ridiculously old evidence of hominids doing just that. \n It could be that archaic homo sapiens were making them, though that pushes the time frame back about 80,000 years, like the title says- that would be cool. Or maybe it was another Homo species-  Erectus  was kicking around back then, and Neanderthals were in Europe somewhat close to this time period, presumably stabbing things and eating them.... hell, there is even some [evidence]( suggesting that  heidelbergensis  was using spears, and those guys are like 500,000 years old. \n Also, the dating on this was stratigraphic, not direct- [check out the actual article, its free]( and while useful, this isn't exact direct dating. The youngest layer was still 180,000 years old... and these things were found well below that. So I'm guessing they're pretty damn old. It's cool, because until now we've only had evidence of pre-humans using thrusting spears, not throwing spears. Throwing your weapon, rather then thrusting is a huge step forward in the quest to kill things easily without getting gorged by some angry, hurt wild animal. \n Basically, the": "science",
            "Hold on there Cowboy. You're all over the place. Let's see what we can do here. \n First, are we talking about City-states, Chiefdoms, or Empires? The first part of your questions seems to want to talk about Civilizations, like Mesopotamia, Egypt, Mesoamerica, etc.  But the second part seems to want to focus on when humans first started living a sedentary life-style. These are two incredibly different things. \n Let's clear up the second part first. \nYou section about \"when we started having permanent residences\" is a giant question in archaeology. We don't know everything about it, but we do know it doesn't happen in \"a few generations\". \n The movement from a nomadic lifestyle to one of permanent, multi-year long settlements is not a quick one. Frank and Bill don't decide one day to stay put and start making babies with Marge and Roma.\n In a very ( very, very, very ) generalized sense, this change happens over a couple of thousand years. In some cases, this transition may go faster (say a couple of hundred years) but in both cases the combination of environmental stability (i.e. food sources), demographics (i.e. population size), and social factors (i.e. social organization) have to come together in a certain way that either forces or allows people to stay put. \n Just how much one of these factors is responsible for people starting to stay where they are is a source of thousands of research articles, books, dissertations, etc. We know that it takes a certain coming together of these factors- but we don't know exactly how they need to come together. \n Still with me? Good. Moving on to warfare. \n As people start to settle down, they don't need as huge an area around them to occupy. Nomadic groups, with seasonal camps, require a much large area to play in-- but as you settle down (and start living off more predictable and renewable foods), you don't have to move as far. \n If a bunch of groups do this-- and they tend to as local conditions allow-- they start forming territories. When one of these territories pump into another, then conflict starts. Warfare is one way of resolving these conflicts-- and not always the default. \n Again- I'm being incredibly simplistic here-- this story plays out differently every time it's reenacted-- but I'm giving you the abstract. \n The thing is, these sedentary villages- they haven't reached Civilization levels yet. Hell, mostly they're not even at Chiefdoms by the time this starts: they have a level of social-political organization we like to call \"transegalitarian\". Because we like big words. \n If those three factors I mentioned above (environment, demography, and social organization) interact in certain ways, we get chiefdoms. Now this isn't the inevitable outcome of the march of time. It's a specific response to specific factors. I mention this because it's an important fact people often over look. We don't move from Tribes, to Chiefdoms, to Civilizations if we have enough time. We only do it if the situations are ideal for it to happen. Civilizations are not \"more evolved\" or \"more advanced\" then nomadic hunter-gatherers. No more than a sparrow is \"more evolved\" than a mongoose. They are two different things-- the result of separate historical, geographical, and environmental factors. I mention this because when ever I taught about Early Civs, this 'more advanced' nonsense came up and it bugged the crap out of me. \n Now we can get to your first question, What happen to these people when there social structure 'fell'? \n In some cases they're taken over by new leadership. The fall of Rome was probably not that noticeable to the average Roman. It happened over a long time, and was really just a switch from one kind of leader to another. Why we call it a \"Fall\" is because during this time Roman influence over the larger world lessened significantly. Which allowed other rulers to take the place of Roman Governors. Though that's how it worked in Rome. \n In the Maya area, the \"Fall\" also took a couple of hundred years, but the collapse was a movement away from centralized control, to one of more regional control. Mayan leaders didn't quite disappear, they just had more local control, and less regional power. Which translate into less wealth. In the Mayan case, it was likely a combination of social factors (they were a little top-heavy towards the end) and environmental factors (it's hard to be the king when your people are not growing enough food) \n One more time ( say it with me people! )-- this is not the full answer! Simplifying the causes of a collapse into generalities means that you're missing the real complexity of the situation. Like saying America went to war with Iraq for oil. You, me, and most other people know that's not the  whole  truth. But it's a big part of the story. \n The best way to think about culture change is this: \n Cultures have a variety of adaptive options, and when they form larger communities you get the multitude of different types of chiefdoms, civilizations, etc. that we see. When they are forced by a variety of factors to change again, they have the same plethora of options. Which is why studying human cultural change on a global level is so damn hard,l and why the answers--even simplified like I did here-- are so damn complicated. And fun.": "Anthropology",

I'm going to assume you mean Indigenous groups, referring to culturally distinct groups that had been affected by the processes of colonization [(See this)]( Second, I'm going to assume you meant Western Culture by 'our culture'. Third, your word 'forced' is apt. It's going to come into play later. \n Okay, on to my answer: \n It has nothing to do with an introduction of alcohol. Humans everywhere like to get messed up. We almost always find a way to do it. In the Americas I can think of a few off the top of my head. The Apache drank a fermented corn 'beer' called [Tiswin]( [Chicha]( was big in the Andes. First Nations people on the East Coast had a drink called the ['Black Drink']( while not alcoholic, it certainly was a powerful narcotic. \nThere are many other [examples]( \n These drinks were not distiled however, meaning that they had less bang for their buck. But that's not the issue. \n The issue is that substance abuse, in ALL forms, is directly correlated with poverty, poor living conditions, a lack of family structure, etc., etc. Basically everything that comes from being Indigenous people under Western Colonialism. The history of colonialism, with residential schools, forced education, disease, and general not-being-nice, resulted in living conditions that are ripe for substance abuse. It doesn't matter what the substance is, its the symptom, not the cause. \n Have you ever read about the  Rat Park  don't get addicted to drugs. I believe it's kind of the same thing.

            "Well good Redditor, it's a great question. I think you've inspired me to write about it in an upcoming blog post. I'll post the link when I'm done, but off the top of my head: \n People like feeling like they are part of something bigger than themselves. This feeling can be inspirational. Virantiquus had incredibly good points about social change and illumination from the past and I can speak to this from an experiential level. \nI am currently working on a small research project as a follow up to a rather large excavation I was part of. Rather than focusing on the data from the artifacts, my partner and I are focusing on the community wide benefits that archaeology has brought. \nWithout going in to too much detail, the responses we have got from collaborating with local First Nations have been amazing. There is a tangible connection to the past, and a feeling that some connection to a larger part of their heritage is available to them. \n Athardude mentioned the ability for archaeology to inform modern sustainability and resource use-- this is huge where I work. Shell middens on the West Coast provided a length and depth of data on fish populations, run times, seasonality, and sustainability that otherwise wouldn't be available. \n Archaeology has the ability to inform us about the complexities of our lives. When someone simplifies an historical narrative in an attempt to justify a current ambition or goal (either good or bad), we can provide the context to those who want to listen with a larger more complete picture, and hopefully an understanding that things are, and have always been, more complicated that they first seem. \n And finally I offer a simpler, less tangible--but just as valid--rationale: Archaeology helps us paint a bigger, more complete picture of the world we live in. Not for any particular goal- just because its cool to understand things. I love physics and biology--not because of what they have produced FOR me, but because of the wonder and amazement they have produced IN me. We don't need to take pictures of far away galaxies-- but we should-- because it helps us understand the bigger picture. Just like physicist looking out into space, we look back in time to understand our universe. As  HaveAMap pointed out: this stuff is just plain cool. \n I have walked my mom around one of the largest village sites in Ontario, shown her 40m wide pithouses in British Columbia, let her pick up and hold 5000 year old knives from shell middens, had her place her thumb in the preserved thumb print of a 600 year old potter.The connection she felt to other people, to the whole of humanity, made all the ours of artifact washing and data gathering worth it. I have shown young children how their ancestors made tools and fished, spoke to Elders about the stories their ancestors bones can tell, and I have learned throughout it all a little bit more about what it means to be a human in this world. I am incredibly privileged that I live in a world that supports these kind of experiences, and I see it as our responsibility to share this with as many people as we possibly can. Being human is awesome. We do ridiculously amazing stuff. We should all feel proud that we're part of something as cool as being human. And archaeology can help us feel that way. \n I'm sorry.

The first question is: whose year?  Because if we go by the ship's clock, that will actually be 10 earth years! \n Or, we could say that everyone agrees beforehand that the ship's destination is 1 lightyear away from earth  when measured from the earth's frame of reference . In this case, once the ship got up to speed, they see this distance contracted to only 0.1 lightyears, and they would take them a bit more than a month (by the ship's clock) to get there. \n Of course, mission control would still think that it takes the ship 1/0.99 = 1.0101 years to traverse this distance, and they would  also  be right. \n Now, the ship hangs out there for a year, because, why not. \n (Fun sidenote: if the ship sends out a radio signal that says 'i made it!', it takes one year for that signal to return to the earth at the speed of light.  So even though the ship can make it there in a touch over a year, the earth still won't receive confirmation until more than two years have passed.) \n Okay, fine, ready to come home.  Same thing happens - the return journey takes 1.0101 years by the earth clock, and .01 years by the ships clock. \n (Come back to the sidenote though. If the ship sends out a 'coming home now' radio message, it will get back to earth in an earth year. But the ship only takes 1.0101 years to get back right?  So the earth sees the ship return only 0.0101 years ~ 3 days after they are informed that its on its way back!) \n Long story short: how much time has passed by earth's estimation?  1.0101 years + 1.0 years + 1.0101 years = 3.0202 years.  How much time has passed by the ship's estimation? 0.1 years + 1.0 years + 0.1 years = 2.2 years.   And it is perfectly okay that they disagree. \n We do not all experience time in the same way.

I think that, instead, the closest answer to your question comes from relativity.  And not black holes, but fast-moving objects. \n You may or may not know about time dilation - the phenomenon whereby fast moving clocks slow down.  So, for instance, there are energetic particles called muons, which are produced when cosmic rays hit the upper atmosphere. (Super short  wiki discussion here   But because, from our perspective, these things are produced with very high velocities - comparable to the speed of light - they survive for a much longer time.  That's time dilation. \n From the perspective of the muon, something else happens, called length contraction.  (You can still use  the same wiki article   Because, from its perspective, the earth is rushing towards it at something like the speed of light, the distance between the upper atmosphere (where it was created) and the surface of the earth (where we detect it) is, for lack of a better word, contracted. \n So far so good.  But there's another relativistic effect that happens for things that move close to the speed of light.  Not only is there time dilation, and length contraction, but there is also something called the relativistic mass increase.  (Imperfectly pitched wiki entry [here]( \n The upshot is that, as the speed of something gets closer and closer to the speed of light, its inertial mass increases faster and faster.  What do i mean by inertial mass?  Well, you know that its harder to accelerate something that's heavier than something that's lighter.  You can open a screen door with a finger, but you've got to work to open a bank vault.  That's what i mean by inertial mass: the ratio between how hard you push, and how much something accelerates. \n So as you get something up closer and closer to the speed of light, the greater and greater its inertial mass becomes.  And as it approaches the speed of light, its inertial mass becomes infinite.  This is, by the way, why nothing with mass can travel at the speed of light, because even if the thing is so close to the speed of light that you can taste it, its inertial mass is essentially infinite, and you essentially have to push on in infinitely hard to get it to go any faster, which means that its acceleration will always be infinitesimal.": "askscience",

The bigger the crosse, the more likely that point is 'bad'.  I've plotted the crosses under the grey points, so that they don't visually dominate. \n Then, starting from the top of the plot, i divide the data into bins in mass (which is what is plotted on the y axis).

            "Information as a technical term is related to entropy.  (I don't know anywhere where knowledge is a technical term.)  The problem is that entropy in an information theory context is similar, but not the same as, entropy in a physics context. \n In physics, i think that the best way to think about entropy is like this.  (But before i start, i have to say that this is not how it's usually introduced in an undergrad course!)  Think about a water wheel.  Water comes in, falls through some height, and turns a wheel as it goes.  Now shift your thinking from a water 'engine' to a heat engine: at the start, you have some stuff at a higher temperature, which 'falls' down to a lower temperature, and in the course of doing so, it does some work.  Or, to go one level of abstraction further, you have some stuff at a higher energy, and some other stuff at a lower energy: work can be done when energy flows from one to the other. \n Note that if the two bits of stuff are at the same height/temperature/energy, then there can be no net flow between them, and no work can be done.  The amount of work that you can do depends on the size of the height/temperature/energy gap between your two bits of stuff.  But it doesn't depend on the actual heights/temperatures/energies of the bits of stuff.  You could have two things both at a temperature of a bajillion Kelvin, but you can't get any work from either of them unless you get something else with a temperature of more or less than a bajillion K. \n This is what entropy quantifies in physics: the amount of energy that is available to do work.  Actually, it's the inverse of this - by which i mean that entropy = 1 / 'free' energy - which makes things confusing.  But this is why entropy always increases: any time energy flows from one place to another, the amount of 'free' energy decreases, so the entropy goes up. \n Here, energy and mass are the same thing.  But entropy is a  quality  of the system: entropy does not really  exist  in the same way as mass. \n Usually in undergrad physics, you are taught to think about the statistical definition of entropy, which boils down to how many different ways (microstates) you can assemble a system without changing its global properties (macrostate).  But this way of thinking skips over all of the awesome early history of thermodynamics, and obscures a lot of the really very sensible parts of thermodynamics, which is why everything thinks its shit and non-intuitive. \n In any case, this is where the analogy to information theory is strongest, because you can ask the same question about a chain of letters or numbers or whatever.  Here, entropy is defined as the inverse of the information content of that chain.  (Although it is also sometimes defined as the inverse of the  randomness  in the chain, which is deeply confusing!)  Information theorists sometimes do talk as though information is a real thing that exists, but i don't agree with that.

            "I disagree with most of the posts in this thread. There are aspects of evolution that can happen quickly and predictably. I predict humans will evolve in the following ways in the next 100 years. \n 1) Increased admixture. With increasing globalization and relaxation of sociocultural attitudes, populations will continue to become less differentiated, and more people will be born of mixed population ancestry. Heterozygosity will increase, which ironically will decrease the prevalence of homozygotic traits. (We may see less red-heads). \n 2) Migration/Gene Flow. Pretty obvious. Related to admixture. Also influenced by globalization. \n 3) Host-disease evolutionary dynamics. Epidemics such as AIDS and Ebola have in the past few decades have selected for and will continue to select for disease resistance. Chances are there will be a few more such diseases this century, as long as there's still impoverished areas of the world without access to modern epidemiology. \n 4) Selective neutrality of previously deleterious diseases. As biomedicine improves, previously traits that were deleterious but persist in the population due to e.g. recessiveness, will become treatable and therefore neutral. The relaxation of selective pressure would allow such now treatable disorders to drift more freely in the population and increase. An example of this that is already happening is the observed increase in near-sightedness. \n 5) Genetic screening. Expansion of prenatal screening and women's reproductive rights will reduce the prevalence of very deleterious disorders. An example of this that is already happening is Down's syndrome, and there's no reason to not expect it won't happen with much more genetically influenced disorders such as Huntington's. This effectively removes these alleles from the gamete pool, and homozygous genotypes from the genotype pool. \n 6) Sexual selection, small selective coefficients, and genetic drift, will always exist to a limited extent. \n 7) Genetic engineering and gene therapy. There's a very real possibility that this will become a reality in the next century. CRISPR in humans may become a thing. \n 8) One demographic aspect of human evolution is that our population has grown tremendously in the past 200 years. As the rest of the world completes their demographic transition, the world population will eventually stabilize in population and actually start to decline somewhat (people in developed nations consistently reproduce at below replacement fertility). Exponential population growth has immediate effects on evolution, and this will shift as the world population enters a new regime of population stabilization and decline. One example effect of exponential population growth is that it introduces a lot of very rare variants quickly into the population, that is, many very rare familial diseases, which may soon go to extinction. It also means genetic diversity will increase as our effective population size catches up to census size (though this will happen over longer time scales than a century). \n 9) By demographic corollary, since African and to a lesser extent Asia will shoulder the brunt of the population growth in the next century (since most of the West has already stabilized in population), there will be a shift in gene frequencies at the global level. Africa in particular has always had the most genetic diversity of any human population, so we'll see a great expansion in the frequency of very diverged alleles that up until recently have only been found in isolated African populations. \n 10) Unexplored dynamics between an aging world population, longer reproductive spans, and selection.": "evolution",
            "Intro: Seeing the list (link below) of top 10 most torrented shows of 2014 (8.1m for GoT at 1st place, and 2.4m for South Park at 10th place), I decided to see how Korra compares. \n Methods: I looked through KickAT, using the search term \"Korra\", looking through the first 4 pages of results ordered by seeds (by then, the number of seeds had dropped from over 2000 to about 200), and summed the number of episode torrents for Book 4 and Book 3 separately. \n Results: Book 4 had at least 1.8m episode torrents. Book 3 had at least 450k episode torrents. Assuming I only looked at about 80% of all the downloads (a conservatively high number), I estimate at least 2.2m torrents for Book 4, and 560k torrents for Book 3. \n Discussion: My guess is that my Book 3 estimate is actually much too low, since more time has passed since Book 3, and seed number has decayed, it's probably at least 1m if not more, as I can believe it being lower than Book 4 but not by such a huge amount (though being on tv for most of its run probably reduced torrents). Both estimates are probably too low, but I assumed a conservative yield. Regardless, it is very possible that Korra has been torrented more in 2014 than 10th place South Park, though a proper comparison would require applying the above method to those shows as well, and seeing how well the numbers recovered match those given in the article (since I can't reproduce the article's methodology itself). Though it is somewhat an unfair comparison since Book 4 alone had 30% more episodes than South Park, and Book 3 and 4 together had 26 episodes all together, which is many more than most shows air in a year. Nonetheless, my guess is that Korra episodes have been torrented at least 3 million times in the past 6 months since Book 3 aired, which should make it one of the 10 most popular episodes in terms of illegal downloads of 2014, possibly higher than Suits, Vikings, Grey's Anatomy, and Arrow. This is pretty good considering that Korra is freely available to view online without a network or cable subscription on Nick (for most people), and also doesn't include non-torrent illegal streaming, and legal paid streaming distributors like Amazon and iTunes.

But it doesn't need to be a direct relationship, there merely needs to be some kind of statistical measure of fitness that we can attribute to different genetic variants, which we can. \n Proteins don't fit any of those axioms. The only one it really fits is fitness differences, and only in one sense, that if organism A has protein A and organism B has protein B, and organism A has higher fitness than organism B, we can say protein A has higher fitness than protein B.

            "An interesting question to consider is why HIV became so widespread in just the past century while viruses such as smallpox, polio, and many others have been documented in ancient texts? \n Well the answer is right there. History. \n Viruses need to spread from host to host in order to \"live\". This is easily achieved when you have a large concentration of people living together, and when that happens people get starter and write things down. So now we have ancient Egyptians writing about Polio. \n Let's look at HIV. It spreads from host to host using the bloodstream. It's not like polio which uses a fecal oral route, which is undoubtedly much easier to transmit. Now lets look at the geography, the dense forests of subSaharan Africa. The areas in which humans had contact with higher apes such as the chimpanzee remained relatively sparsely populated until Western colonization. Thus it's quite reasonable to assume that a SIV spread from a chimpanzee or other ape into a human by means of hunting and subsequent butchering. But because the virus needed to adapt to the human host, then spread to other humans, and then continue spreading the probability of having an endemic HIV was nearly impossible until cities began to flourish. \n Thus continued contact with apes, plus a more dense population, plus the introduction of intravenous drug use and prostitution (locals and foreigners using the same prostitutes) from \"sailor culture\" led to a sustainable HIV.": "biology",

            "Evening all -  wall of text inbound. \n I had the great pleasure of taking part in two separate tournaments over the weekend; one in Parramatta NSW and the other up the coast in Newcastle. Massive shout out to both  The Games Cube . \n Saturday - The Games Cube Parramatta (400pts) \n The Games Cube decided to run an XL-sized tournament using a non-FFG scoring system (due to their being no official MoV for 400pt games as of yet). A margin of 30pts or less was a draw and scored both players 3pts, a margin beyond this was 4-2, and if the victor doubled their opponents score it became 5-1. In all results 1 bonus point was on offer to either player if they managed to kill their opponent's flagship. \n As a filthy rebel at heart, as well as a sucker for squadrons, I took what became affectionately referred to as ['The Whale Pod']( - 3 Guppies with Luke, Wedge, Dutch, and 4 Y-Wings. \n Having taken Dangerous Territory to another tournament I had found that the benefit for losing initiative was minimal (for my fleet at any rate). Deciding to shake things up I opted to try and play on the perception of Minefields' ineffectiveness and find a way to make it support my list.  In the end, while I would find it wasn't perfect, a mine layout similar to  this . \n The Games Cube had a full prize pack on offer so I was really hoping to pick up an alternate art Guppy or, if I was lucky, the coveted medal. With 6 players in the tournament my basic mindset was 'don't make any glaringly stupid mistakes and you should go alright'. \n Game 1 \n My first catch of the day was against Courtney, a fantastic dude new-ish to the game. His list was 2 VSDs with a smattering of upgrades (one was a carrier VSD, the other a direct damage dealer) and Demolisher with I believe Motti as his Admiral. Also a bucket load of fighters and bombers. \n Courtney took the initiative and elected to take Minefields. The deployment really threw him, and he swung wide around to the right. This strung his fleet out and in the end his carrier VSD did not do anything of use the entire game. The fighter balls engaged without any decisive victor - although Luke and 2 Y's broke off to deal solid damage to Demolisher. Demolisher after this snub-fighter foray got focused down as a result of flying to close to the Whale Pod; however with the loss of some hero squadrons, points were tilted barely in my favour. His Motti VSD having turned in to meet my Guppies copped an Asteroid and a Mine on the same turn, and then before it could move received the full brunt of Paragon. \n Paragon managed to score a critical, Comm Noise, which led to the no-brainer decision of dropping his speed to 0. Without defence tokens Motti dropped hard in the final turn sealing me a 6-1. \n Game 2 \n Game two was against Dan, a player who I had taken on once before in an earlier foray. To summarise, I don't know if Dan just hates my occasionally lucky rolls or me personally but that is the atmosphere we have. \n Dan's list was two VSD's (one I and one II) with a butt load of squadrons (4 or 5 Bombers, Vader, Howlrunner, 2 Tie Advanced, 2-3 Interceptors). Dan opted to make me go first and I took Dangerous Territory. I will say that this game was easily the worst that I played the entire weekend - I made lots of strategically poor decisions and moves that, barring a single good roll, should have probably cost me the game. \n As it was we deployed basically facing each other, with an obstacle / objective in front of each of our ships (with the 6th far off to the side). My plan was to nab my 3 objectives and then swing hard right to leave one VSD high and dry. Which, in the end, was basically what happened, but it was a close run thing. The VSD-II with Dominator and Tarkin traded front arcs with Paragon's side as the fly by occurred and this left both ships pretty beat up. Dominator stripping it's shields came back to haunt it however as Paragon's rear arc on Turn 5 managed to score exactly enough damage (with H9's securing the accuracy to lock down brace) off a concentrated shot to slay the behemoth. \n Dan was not impressed. His bomber wing chased afterwards and left Paragon limping along with 2HP left, but in the end it was not enough and the score was again 6-1. \n Game 3 \n After two big wins I was seeded top table for the final game of the day. My opponent Damien was the only other Rebel in attendance, running a Guppy, two corvettes (1 Red, 1 Blue), Neb-B with Salvation, Wedge, 3 Y-Wings, and 4 A-Wings. This game was the first time I had ever faced another Rebel using Mon Mothma, and I must stress how much I hate that troll of a woman when it's not me using her. \n Having heard Courtney's lamentations over taking Minefields, Damien opted to take Hyperspace Assault after I elected to play second. Paragon jumped into Hyperspace with two Y-Wings as the remaining guppies prepared to limp along the corner edge at Speed 1. Damien on the other hand flew in from all angles at maximum speed. This overeagerness cost him his blue corvette at the bottom of turn 2, however, as he overextended the ship into close range double arcs. \n This  was a huge early blow that was soon compounded by Paragon jumping in behind his Assault Frigate. In the end, despite Salvation's best efforts I traded my carrier Guppy for the rest of his ships. \n This game, much like the second and first, was far closer than points would have suggested, but once again it ended 6-1 in my favour. With a clean sweep I had secured my first ever tournament victory and the coveted [medal]( Fucking stoked! \n The weekend however was only half way done. \n Sunday - Good Games Newcastle (300pts) \n Making the drive up from Sydney with /u/irokenics, we were back to the Wave 1 standard 300pts. Without the extra 100pts my [Newcastle list]( dropped a guppy in favour of Jaina and parsed the squadrons down heavily while opting to keep the same objectives. \n Newcastle is meant to be the best meta currently in Australia, and with six of the top 8 placings at Nationals (including first) coming from Newcastle it was going to be a tough day out. Reflecting how good the community up there is though player turnout was excellent with 16 players turning up (absolute madness!). You can  see most of us . \n Game 1 \n Game one was against a great player by the name of (I believe) Jason, who had placed 8th at Australian Nationals. This was without question my toughest game of the weekend - Jason flew a mean game and it proved to be a real nail biter. \n Jason's list was an Assault Frigate with Mon Mothma, A Blue Corvette with Dodonna's Pride, an EA Red Corvette, and Salvation. Jason opted for the Minefields assuming, correctly, that it was his best bet. This was one of the few games where [I have a photo]( of ships on the field. Here you can see us heading into turn 2. I deployed roughly centre of the board while Jason spread his ships the full breadth. My plan was to accelerate and hook left to try and take on his corvettes - leaving behind his guppy and Salvation. \n As it happened though my Mon Mothma guppy got jammed up on his red corvette in the centre of the field - trading 3 separate rams before Paragon collided to finish the ship off. Meanwhile Jaina and Salvation traded blows as his Guppy looped in menancingly behind. The real danger though was his blue corvette, who swung into range of Mon Mothma with double arcs. As it was I managed to avoid taking two critcals (praise be to evade), or being rammed, leaving Mon Mothma hurt badly (but alive) on 2HP. Some well timed nav commands allowed her to slip by the asteroids and just out of mine range to survive the battle. \n In the meantime a limping Salvation rolled hot to take out a Jaina which had double arcs ready to fire. At this point I was very concerned as I was down by about 2pts. Thankfully Dutch and his boys lay in wait and put some serious hurt on Salvation before Jason made a poor call on the final turn and activated his Guppy first, allowing Paragon to wipe out Salvation before it could reply. In the end I sneaked out a 7-3 victory with a MoV of 69pts by the skin of my teeth to take me into the second round. \n Against the Australian National Champ. \n Welp. \n Game 2 \n Game 2 was against Andrew (the reigning Australian champ and like all the Novocastrians a top dude). Like my first round match up Andrew was also running a 4 ship Rebel list. This time though it consisted of 2 x Mark A Guppies both with Gunnery Teams,  Salvation, and Dodonnas Pride, led by Dodonna himself. Again I elected to go second and Andrew picked Hyperspace Assault, which Paragon happily jumped into. \n Out-shipped and acting second every turn my plan was fairly simple, to keep his fleet at arm's length and not allow him to utilise those deadly broadsides. Executing this I deployed at low speed near the centre of the deployment zone angled to my right. Andrew deployed both his Guppies at maximum speed roughly parallel to my own but angled to my left (I figured to try and get behind my ships). Meanwhile both Salvation and Dodonna's Pride were on the left of his Assault Frigates with a fair space in between and angling diagonally across the board. \n My first few turns consisted of navigating for the extra clicks and to bump both Jaina and Mon Mothma to Speed 3. Both ships hooked hard to my right angling around asteroids and debris fields. As his ships turned in to face them they got bunched up on each other and were left with only frontal arcs for the majority of the game. \n Turn 3 I Squadron commanded Dutch into the heart of his fleet and stripped a fair chunk of Salvation's shields, while my ships continued to kite away from his fleet. Turn 4 saw Paragon arrive behind his fleet ready to unleash some pain. In the end his Dodonna's Pride caught up to Jaina and dealt some solid damage before flying off the board. Although I felt Jaina with double arcs had it covered it was nice not to have to leave it to chance. His Guppies were unable to get into firing position onto my fleet and spent most of the game plinking away at Y-Wings. Salvation was brought low on the final turn through a combination of Paragon and the Dutch Crew. \n All told I lost a single Y-Wing for his Dodonna's Pride and Salvation, netting me a 8-2 with a 103pt margin. \n Game 3 \n The final game of the weekend had me seeded on the third table against the lovely Dean (or so I recall). Dean was running Screed on a naked VSD-I, a VSD-II with Warlord and I believe H9s, and Demolisher with ACMs, Wulf, and Engine Techs. Dean had the initiative bid and elected to go first. Extremely fortuitously Dean decided to play Advanced Gunnery. This was fortuitous because only one other player had ever willingly given my Paragon an  advanced advanced gunnery team. ^tm In all honesty it was always going to be an uphill battle for him from there, a fact he noted on Turn 2 when Paragon off a round of shooting left his VSD-I with its single rear shield remaining. \n Paragon did all the heavy lifting here, melting his VSD-I and touching up Screed (who ended up flying off the board as it was chased by Dutch and co.) and finally nabbing Demolisher after it had munched on Jaina. The game ended 10-0 in my favour, leaving me on 25pts for the day, taking out second behind a a great fellow named Andrew. \n Unsurprisingly, I had a phenomenal weekend but really what was fantastic was seeing the fledgling Australian Armada community turn out for some choice tournaments. \n Can't wait for the next one. \n **": "StarWarsArmada",
            "Funnily enough what prompted this thread was my experience with Typhus today. \n My Chapter Master and his bloodied retinue of Assault Marines jumped into combat with Typhus and some attending plague zombies. The zombies were crushed into the dirt by the force of the landing, leaving the two behemoths to duke it out.  Though he fought valiantly and left Typhus near dead my Chapter Master was brought low. All bar one of the Assault Marines was then killed the following turn, the lone survivor breaking. \n Typhus chased in earnest and charged the poor marine again as he fled. Turning, he found a gap in the Nurgle Lord's armour with his chainsword and redeemed his honour.": "Warhammer",

With this in mind I probably would not run the double HQ normally if I had access to more troops. \n I played a full game against a semi drop wolves list, and a speed run 2/3rds game against /u/stressfulsebby's tournament Imperial Fist list. \n The drop wolves were 4, 10 man, units of Grey Hunters (3 in Drop Pods) and a Storm Eagle filled to the brim with a 9 or 10 man Wolf Guard Terminator Squad and a Wolf Lord. We played the Relic with Hammer and Anvil deployment on a pretty urban map. I managed to secure the relic early on, but the meltas off the drop pod hunters managed to take out the Razorback, costing me first blood and leaving them stranded. \n From there I actually weathered the drop pod assault fairly well, taking the main brunt of casualties in my Vanguard but managing to wipe out his troops. My issues came when the Storm Eagle arrived and unloaded the Wolf Guard onto my tacticals. The rest of the game saw my tacticals whittled down by his Storm Eagle and his Wolf Guard standing on the Relic. Going down 2-1 (Slay the Warlord, First Blood vs Line Breaker). \n The second game against Seb's balanced list (Devastators, 20+ Tacticals, Command Squad, 10 Terminators, 5 Assault Squad, Predator, Storm Talon, Captain, Librarian) was the Scouring with a Vanguard Strike Deployment, and it was truly horrendous to start off with. I have honestly never had a worse first turn. Seb stole the initiative and it really cost me. He threw a lot of firepower at my infiltrated Vanguard and I rolled poorly leaving only 3 of them standing (Oh Shrike I'm so sorry, you were ready to wreck things I know). Adding to this a blown Razorback and I was down 2-0 at the midway point of the first turn. Even worse the objectives on Seb's side ended up being high point ones (4,3,2) so I was really on the back foot. \n Despite this, I actually some how clawed my way back into the game. The surviving Vanguard took out nearly an Assault Squad and two small tactical squads before biting the bullet. The Predator and Tacticals destroyed his Terminators, the Drop Pod did its thing landing behind his Predator and wrecking it from behind. It was actually starting to look pretty ominous for Seb with my Terminators and Storm Raven in the midfield rapidly clearing out his scoring units, without much really to take them on. \n Unfortunately for me we ended up having to call the game at the bottom of the 3rd turn with Seb in a big lead of 8-5 (Slay the Warlord, First Blood, 4pt and 3pt Objective vs 3pts and 2pt Objective). \n Both games were fantastic and really taught me a lot about how Raven Guard needs to be played. I think the big weakness at the moment are the Razorbacks (that damn first blood), but honestly that's something I have to learn to work around by bettering my deployment/movement. The big positive was how the army seems to just eat away at larger armies and can really turn a bad situation around.": "Warhammer",
            "Fuck so many of these options are sweet as if you work it right. As Tau (irrespective of caste) you would enjoy the burgeoning prosperity and the purpose/relative enjoyment of the Greater Good. As a Daemon your immortal, fucked up in the head from our perspective, but essentially living an endless life that you would enjoy (Necrons pretty much fall under this as well). Dark Eldar would be great if you were into kinky shit. Eldar would be beautiful but tragic at the same time.

            "My knee jerk reaction to this reveal was one in which my urge to kill was distinctly, and quite immediately, rising. Honestly though, now that I have actually sat and thought about the changes 7E will bring, I genuinely believe it is a positive move. \n My main issue at first glance was with the whole idea of 'Unbound' armies, but honestly I think most tournaments worth their salt will simply impose 'Battle-Forged Only' rules in a similar vein to how they handled Escalation and so on. \n For friendly games, I think if you have a good group the limitations of what is considered sporting will rule the day just like they do now with cheese lists. Personally, you could also stipulate where you draw the line on what you feel is an abuse of the system, and just refuse to play with people who are in disagreement with you (and this could work both ways honestly). \n As a bonus though I think there is a huge potential with Unbound armies for both the creation of really fluffy armies and for just stupidly fun games in a friendly setting. For example, my main force is Raven Guard and when I sat there and started thinking about all the possibilities I had available to just try something ridiculous it was really quite liberating (50+ Assault Marines anyone?). This is something I think would also work really well for narrative campaigns or even just for one off games. \n Also while it remains to be seen how well they have implemented it, I am quietly excited for the new Psychic phase. I think given the place of Psykers in the lore they have been let down for some time in terms of their role in the game system. Now they are quite a large part of the game which I think will lead to a lot interesting changes.": "Warhammer",
            "Of the three you have said I would go  Surburbia . It's a great game and does a great job of hitting that balance of having strategic decision making without out staying its welcome. Plus (whether or not this applies to you) I love games where you have progression and expansion (in this case that of building and extending your city). However it is easy to get shut out of Surburbia early on if you make a few bad calls, so keep that in mind. \n Dominant Species  is an awesome game, but its quite heavy, and is also a long game if you play the full game without reducing the turns (but you can do this when setting up the game!). I love heavy Euro's and I think the theme is really cool, but it could be a tough sell. \n I haven't played  King of New York  but if you already have  King of Tokyo  then I would say to branch out and pick up a game that fills a different niche in your group's collection. \n Other suggestions! There is a substantial core of games to fall back on that tend to always come up in these threads (and deservedly so they are all awesome!).  Carcassone, Dominion, Agricola, Terra Mystica, and Ticket to Ride  all spring to mind as games that could slot into most gaming groups quite comfortably. \n My pick of these would be the last three.  Ticket to Ride  is a game I always have time for, it is one of the easiest games to learn but is always fun to come back to (and has serious longevity through the wealth of map packs available). Your first game of  Terra Mystica  will confuse you. Your second should have you hooked, [let people far more capable than me tell you why its amazing]( Lastly  Agricola , it's my flair. It's about building a rural farm just prior to the Enlightenment. It has animeeples and the real chance of starving and failing. I love it.": "boardgames",

            "Ok. In addition, to make things interesting, let's loosen your narrative ban and say that Link is the herald of Naga or some such thing, so that he can receive her protection and not literally be insta-killed in the final chapter. \n All of the early chapters are literally no problem; no quantity of faceless bandits can take down the uber-link you've outlined above. Even once unit diversity and numbers begin to increase later in the game, he's still fine. Epona, the hook shot, and the bow give him absurd maneuverability and reach within any environment. Fliers and slow magic wielders fall to his arrows, and he can use epona and the hook shot to keep himself from ever being surrounded / running out of stamina. Projectiles get reflected back, and his tanking ability is considerable with all the half dmg tunic + potion. All this, along with your dark magic ruling, leads me to the following conclusion: \n Link's only threatened by swift and/or somehow protected dark magic users, when talking about the usual FE cannon fodder. Dark FE mages are usually very slow though, so Link gets the benefit of the doubt here too. Since dark magic is the only magic he can't reflect/parry/tank effectively, it's the only attack type that demands to be dodged, and will therefore wear out his stamina quickly if he can't dispose of the threat. \n Therefore, I'm going to claim that Link is at serious risk of dying on chapter 21, \"Five Gemstones\". He starts out in a winding dungeon that constantly spawns new enemies until he escapes. There are dark mages using super-long range \"Mire\" Magic hidden in locked rooms and behind the very walls that he flat out cannot access, and thus cannot kill. He has to dodge every mire attack while simultaneously fending off high level ground forces; his worst nightmare. If he runs out of stamina he's dead. \n The chapter after that pits him against 6 Deadlords w/ holy weapons + Aversa. I have little doubt he could take out the Dreadlords, even taking on 2-3 at a time, but Aversa complicates things. She's a fast, flying dark Mage. This is another series death risk. \n The chapter after that against Validar, despite him being a strong dark Mage, should be cake, since he gets to 1v1 Validar first before taking on a bunch of rabble. When Validar returns w/ dragon skin and reinforcements, it's less of a problem than it appears because Link has a much greater advantage verses a tough slow target than he does an agile one. \n The Final Chaper is the last one where Link could fail. Endless spawns until he kills Grima, whose attacks must be dodged instead of reflected/dodged/tanked, just like Dark Magic. Though Grima's \"body\" never moves, his health is so high that he may be able out Tank Link directly.": "whowouldwin",
            "I am not ok with proxies in the vast majority of circumstances. I'm not vehement on the subject (if your groups prefers, fine; this is a leisure activity). \n There's a reason WotC doesn't sell playsets of each new set alongside other complete board games like Monopoly, Catan, Risk, etc, and it's not solely profit motivated. Playing the game isn't the only thing about Magic I enjoy, the act of collecting itself is enjoyable. There's a correspondence present in players' minds between a card's rarity and a card's power; a correspondence that actually serves to improve your experience. \n Think back to your early days of play, when a stable income and internet marketplaces didn't make acquisition of cards trivial. When you were a kid, and you opened that Darksteel Colossus, you felt fantastic. A distinct part of that feeling was the illusion that these cards really were hard to acquire, and that you were lucky enough to get your hands on one. You would play it at the end if your long, durdly kid games and people would go \"Holy fish tits, Ryan's got a Darksteel Colossus!\" It made you feel special, and it make that Darksteel Colossus seem that much cooler. It made the experience better for you. Now that card acquisition is so easy, monetary value is really the last thing (outside of alters and signed cards) that preserves that sense of rarity. Or, more specifically, I should say that cards that cost a ton cost that much BECAUSE people value them. They are the adult \"Wow!\" cards. \n When someone plays an obvious proxy Sword of Fire and Ice, for example, that illusion breaks. I'm no longer at a table of people flinging these (literally!)rare and powerful spells at one another, I become distinctly aware that I am at a table of people carefully organizing colored cardboard based on a series of premeditated rules--- and I don't like that. My immersion, bolstered by the art and my percieved value of the cards we're playing with, is gone. Someone else playing a proxy made my experience measurably worse.": "EDH",
            "I beat  Fire Emblem: Awakening . \n As a longtime fan, I can confidently say that this is the most polished entry the franchise has ever produced, and is  the only FE game I'd recommend to everyone . The 3 difficulty levels and the ability to turn off perma-death give the game far more appeal to casual players who don't want to restart the same level over and over again to keep all your units alive. For long time fans, you'll be happy to know that Awakening synthesizes positive elements from every modern FE game and improves on all of them. It has: \n \n The overworld map from Sacred Stones, but without the infinite grinding that made SS easy on higher difficulties. \n \n The branching class options from SS, personalizing unit development. \n \n Weapon Forges from Path of Radiance/Radiant Dawn, but with total improvement caps that turn forging into a strategic decision (should this sword be stronger or have a higher hit chance?) instead of just a question of \"how much money can I put into this weapon?\" \n \n The Skill system from PoR/RD, but with over twice the number of options and a flexible, simplified equip method. Acquire skills as you level, pick five, switch them out before battle. No more points and pie charts. \n \n \n On top of that, every new mechanic is spot on. \n \n A customizable, playable avatar unit is equally appealing to new and old FE players; it gently instills a sense of personal involvement in the former who may be turned off by what they interpret at first glance to be a \"standard fantasy plot\", and gives the latter a feature they've dreamed about for years. \n \n The ability to foster relationships between units to the point of marriage and (recruitable!) children adds tremendous replay value and even more narrative depth to a series that's capitalized on its stellar localization and writing for years. \n \n Replacing the Rescue command (which allows one unit to save another at the cost of stat penalties) with \"Pairing Up\" (combining two units into one super unit) was a choice I'll admit I was dubious of at first. The former existed to penalize moving units without thinking, the latter appears to promote the same activity by creating invulnerable hulks. However, by limiting the stat boosts gained and by only allowing units to pair \"behind\" one another, the lead unit is still placed in considerable danger. In essence, they've removed the ability to rescue things entirely, prompting even more thoughtful choices. (I could talk about this mechanic for hours, it's implemented so well on so many levels and there's so much more I haven't touched.) \n \n A mix of weekly paid and free(!) DLC, on a handheld title. We all know why DLC is good and why DLC is bad, so I won't reiterate that for you here. The paid packages will run you 6-7$ for 3 maps, 3 characters, and some new skills, weapons, and items. None of it is required to enjoy the game, though one of the packs can be faulted for being essentially \"infinite EXP, infinite money, and infinite super weapons\". You have to work of all 3 (you have to work  hard  for the third), but that's still what that particular pack boils down to. Additionally, while it's cool to be able to use characters from old FE games (the vast majority of these are free), the lack of support conversations and voice acting makes them lackluster in comparison to the main cast. However, because the main experience suffers in no way from the existence of this DLC, the game can't be faulted for extra content. If you don't want it, don't buy it. \n \n \n The only big fault in the game I could point to, in comparison to other localized FE titles, is a comparatively weak story. I'd place it as the second worst, above Shadow Dragon. The difficulties come from having to deal with so many variables. Your avatar and all of the dozen or so child characters could have completely different qualities and relationships based on player choices. This conflicts with what I've already mentioned as one of FE's greatest strengths, character development. The only game I've ever played that's managed to pull off a wide, branching array of character choices while simultaneously keeping an epic narrative is Mass Effect (accomplished via intricate world building). In particular, most of the \"big choices\" you run into during the story feel forced and unsubstantial. \n Beyond that single flaw, Fire Emblem has never been this good.

            "I'm very glad none of my friends stalk me on reddit. (In case I'm wrong somehow,  turn around you fucks! ) \n To try to summarize, the overall narrative goal I'm heading toward with the setting is a commentary on how remarkably messed up the DM-Player relationship can be and how odd it is that we, as players, desire this bloody war game in the first place. I need a character that's capable of fostering a positive relationship with the party who is later revealed to be manipulating them toward selfish ends. A Fi-like character seemed good for this. This character, by acting as central antagonist, is thus central to my proposed game. \n Now I'll speak in universe and thus summarize a lot less. I'm just including this in case you still feel like you need more info, if you don't feel free to stop now. I know it must get tiring to hear DMs wax about their settings lol. \n The antagonist of my setting is a 10 year old girl accidentally given Pseudo-God powers. She's an average well meaning person, but because of her age fundamentally misunderstands a lot about ethics. Her goal is to literally rapture the population of the earth and give each person their own personal doll-house style utopia of her design. From her perspective, people dying isn't a big deal because she can keep their souls safe in her own little world. Thus, she starts viewing the real world as a playground without consequences. She's also young and thus iffy about assuming that much responsibility. \n That's where the party comes in. Before assuming \"God\" duties, she wants to go on a last grand big fun adventure; re-enact her favorite heroic childhood stories.

            "I'm glad I could be of help. In addition, I'd like to give you a word of advice that I've found most former Yu-Gi-Oh players need when transitioning to Magic. \n By and large, synergies in MtG are nowhere near as obvious as they are in YGO. Though tribal cards like I mentioned above do exist, they're the minority not the majority. When deckbuilding, it's up to you to figure out for yourself how your deck is going to win; the decks usually won't build themselves. \n Take a look at [this.]( The left side of the page lists the most commonly seen cards in Arcanis EDH decks. As you can see, the #1 most used card is [Counterspell.]( The question you should take a second and ask yourself is  why ? It's such a simple effect and it doesn't do a great deal in the long run, so why is it so popular? \n First, think about Arcanis. His purpose is to draw you tons and tons of cards. 3 per turn. When making an Arcanis deck, you've got to think about the best way to turn drawing a bunch of cards into winning the game. Second, think about counterspell. It's essentially a 1 for 1; you loose one card and an opponent looses one card. It slows the game down by keeping the board locked up. The reason both are played together is because Arcanis gives you far, far more cards than your opponent. A 1 for 1 becomes great; your opponent will run out of cards long before you do. Additionally, countering your opponent's removal spells will keep Arcanis alive to net you more cards in the future! The opponent will run out of steam and you'll keep going. This is a classic blue control strategy. \n As you can see, this requires a lot more forethought than just finding cards that say \"Wizards get stronger\" or \"If Dark Magician is in play, X happens.\" You've got to build your own strategies. Find your own synergies. It's one of the many reasons I find Magic more enjoyable; it's just more intellectually engaging.": "EDH",
            "My thread was removed, so per Mod request I'm reposting this here. \n Before moving into my own thoughts, I'm going to start off by assuming general familiarity with the controversy and summarizing current pro and con arguments for the tuck rule. I'm only including a small subset of the arguments I see as legitimate, and this admittedly excludes some of the justifications given by the rules committee itself. If you wish to debate the validity of the arguments presented or omitted in this summary we can debate them in the half-dozen other active threads on this topic. Feel free to skip this if you've been reading every comment thread. \n \n --PRO-- \n \n EDH is a format designed around having consistent access to your commander. Playing a format built on that premise and then having consistent access denied to you is unfun and antithetical to the goals of the format. \n \n The tuck mechanic was a loophole that became accepted as common practice when Wizards began printing cards designed with the loophole in mind (Spell Crumple, Chaos Warp, Derevi). It created undesirable rules complications. \n \n \n --CON-- \n \n Tuck was the only semi-permanent answer to many powerful and/or difficult to interact with generals. Those generals become format warping without the presence of tuck effects. Banning those generals means banning them from the game entirely since the \"Banned as a Commander\" list no longer exists. It is undesirable and/or unnecessary to add numerous new cards to the banned list just to remove the tuck mechanic, and If the rules committee does not ban problem generals, the format will become untenable. \n \n Tucking promoted interaction with the commander mechanic, and in its absence games will become repetitive/boring/undesirable since no removal spell can be considered more than a tempo loss. \n \n \n \n Given these arguments, I think an underlying problem is at work here. And I think it's rooted in the very core of our format. \n Everyone agrees that EDH is defined in part by having special access to the commander, which PRO both arguments are leaning on. Further, I take it for granted that nobody would be in favor of a rule that removed the commander tax for the sake of promoting general access. This would undeniably lead to the kind of boring repetition CON players seem to be worried about. The debate is not over either of these tenents, the debate is over the proper balance between them. However, in order for CON #1 to be valid, an implicit assumption must be present and I believe that it has yet to be broadly voiced. Namely: \n The Commander Tax is not effective enough at deterring access to one's commander \n This is argument I'm here to defend. \n Part of the appeal of EDH is the format's ability to make countless cards uniquely viable. This viability to due to the format's ability to support very mana inefficient cards, which in turn is due to two things: its multiplayer nature (because players can team up to take down the player who is ahead AND because the games last much longer) and possessing 40 starting life w/ the commander damage rule (which neuters aggro strategies not based exclusively on the commander). When every player is playing mana inefficient cards and never has to worry about being aggro'd out of the game, this makes strategies centered around high mana costs and card draw powerful. The power/mana cost ratio of cards is not linear. There's a big jump from 1cmc to 2cmc for example, and the jumps get farther and farther forward in power once you pass 6-7 mana. This is why here and only here you get to play Clone Legion and Insurrection. The fact that we have plenty of time, mana, and life to spend on card draw is what allows strategies based on synergy and engines to thrive despite this being a singleton format. \n When players recognize this nonlinearity in power/mana ratios, this makes ramp extremely powerful. Players start devoting resources in the early game to the late game, since the big cards become the only things strong enough to take on 3 other players. This, too, is seen as a positive feature of the format to many. Sol Ring is legal in this format. The justification for the existence of fast, big mana of this type is (as i understand it) that getting a mana advantage is not as big of deal when getting in 1st place paints a big target on your head. But, of course, this doesn't keep players from running Sol ring. Nobody here would deny the power of EDH ramp. \n So, now that I've established that big mana strategies are not just popular but are actively incentivized by the rules of the game, I'd like to return to the Commander Tax. The goal of the tax is to reduce access to the commander on a non-permanent basis; a compromise between deck consistency and player interaction that we're currently debating in light of the removal of tucking. Nobody wants the extremes on either end, where generals are either unstoppable or never given the opportunity to shine. \n So, given the goals of the Commander Tax, I think it's nonsensical to claim that adding +2cmc to the cost of a card significantly reduces its power or access in an EDH environment. Every deck is incentivized to have ramp which nullifies the increased mana cost, and card draw which allows players to access that ramp. It's a hurdle that doesn't require careful deckbuilding to cross; every competent deck already possesses the means to quickly overcome it turn after turn. Part of what makes EDH unique is the format's ability to mitigate mana inefficiency, so trying to punish players by making their key strategy mana inefficient will necessarily produce only a mitigated punishment. \n \n If tucking remains banned, the punishment for having your general removed needs to be greater. If the goal of the commander tax is to delay, but not prevent, access to the commander, then why not make that delay an explicit part of the rules? I suggest, and am fully open to discussion about, a new house rule in light of the tuck ban that replaces the commander tax entirely. \n The \"Recovery Counter\" Rule \n \"Whenever you Commander is placed in the Command Zone, put a recovery counter on it for each time it has been cast this game. At the beginning of your end step during non-extra turns, remove a recovery counter. A Commander may only be cast from the Command Zone when it has no recovery counters on it.\" \n This rule mandates the kind of delayed access the Command Tax was intended to provide. The End step was chosen over Upkeep for the same reason the non-extra turn clause exists: to keep blue from being able to circumnavigate the system (in this case, with Paradox Haze). There are other interesting implications of this rule (timing of removal matters, flash matters, etc), but this post is long enough so I'll leave that for comment discussion.": "EDH",
            "People here seem to be criticizing Pearl Lake Ancient rather harshly; it doesn't have evasion and thus isn't a good control finisher, prowess on a leviathan is anti-flavor, etc. But I think PLA is evidence of an interesting switch in Wizard's design philosophy for control finishers. \n The most interesting decision points you encounter while using Aetherling are encountered  before you cast it . You consider if your opponent has a counterspell, if he doesn't have another threat in his hand you need mana open for, etc. But once Aetherling is on the field, most of the time the die has been cast already. You'll win if you timed it right, and you'll loose if you played him too soon. His abilities generally allow him to ignore every permenant on the field, so long as you have mana open. \n PLA is the opposite. He has flash and can't be countered, so you don't have to decide in advance whether the time is right, you'll just play him whenever you can. Even if they have the doom blade you can just bounce him and loose a bit of tempo. The biggest decisions related to PLA come when he's in play. You have to interact with your opponent's creatures.

            "Severely \n Seriously though, I can see both sides of the argument- on one hand, it feels like your friend is copying you, and he may be, which isn't cool and takes away some of the fun of the game (in some people's opinions). On the other hand, you inspired your friend to make another deck, a potentially better deck, and now he's exploring new deck ideas and growing as a player from that- something that you can- and should- take at least some pride in. And besides, you should take it as a compliment, as he's sort of \"netdecking\" off of you. A lot of competitive players play netdecks as they are typically the strongest possible decks of any given format. In this case, your friend probably saw that your deck was effective, and wanted to mimic it in some way. The only reason that I personally would get angry at this friend would be if he copied your deck exactly- that requires no thinking on his part and is quite simply not at all cool. The netdeck debate is one I won't go into here because you can find a lot of stuff on it on here and other sites. \n Another factor that I haven't really considered is who you typically play against. For example, over the school year, my playgroup consists of one or two people- that's it. If we all played the same deck, it would get incredibly boring, and nobody would enjoy playing. However, if you have a playgroup, or play at FNM or at an LGS on a regular basis, his copying isn't nearly as bad, as you will be playing each other less often. In fact, in this case it can actually  help  you- he may see that some cards tend to not work, or he may find a sweet combo through playtesting that you missed, and both of your decks will grow stronger because of that.": "magicTCG",

            "I ran a campaign for two players once. However, I had limited time to prepare so I decided to use the campaign I already had prepared (geared for a party of 4-5). I figured that between me scaling a few things back and the players being experienced, they would do fine. \n I was wrong. They decided they wanted to forego all notions of optimizing (we've never really been minmaxers but they went seriously suboptimal) and focus on roleplaying pretty heavily. It was a great time - these two guys are fantastic roleplayers - but when we got to a serious combat session they both died pretty quickly. \n Here's where the roleplaying saved my ass. One of the characters was a wood elf ranger. He was exiled from his tribe for being clumsy (seriously, his character was basically Jar Jar, but actually funny), and spent some time in the woods on his own. While a hermit, he discovered a magical device. When he picked it up for the first time, he instantly learned Celestial (his justification for his background giving him a language) and also gained a small voice in his head that he dubbed \"Preston\". He had no idea what the magical device did, but he said that Preston always told him that he would keep him safe. \n So I made it a Groundhog's Day device, without him knowing. The rule was that as long as it was on his person when he died, it would  reverse time by 24 hours. To avoid the campaign totally breaking, I said it could only do this every 1d12 months. \n So here's what happened: they died in combat, we ended the session. I told them not to worry about making characters, I had a fun thing planned for new character reroll. Come the next session, I put their old character sheets in front of them. We start the session exactly like the last session, except I tell the ranger that he remembers dying and remembers all the things they're doing. The other party member doesn't. He caught on immediately, and roleplayed it like a fucking genius. That was one of the most fun sessions I've ever run.": "dndnext",

But then I decided to go for 100% completion on achievements, so I made a more balanced character and did the Thieve's Guild questline- which I loved.

            "Before I launch into my post, some background: \nI\u2019ve played Modern in some form since its inception. I started with a janky Groundbreaker stompy deck, then quickly shifted over to Burn to play an actual competitive deck that I could afford all of. I played Burn for a long time and in several variations- mono red, red/black, RBW, and RBWg. After Deathrite Shaman was banned, I tested a bit (even trying out UR Burn), then decided it wasn\u2019t worth it and sought to play UWR Twin because I had most of the cards (primarily, the fetches). So, read the following knowing that I\u2019ve only been playing UWR Twin for a few months. \n In that time, I\u2019ve found that the namesake of the deck- Splinter Twin - is, in fact,  the worst card in the deck . Here\u2019s my reasoning: \n \n Creatures can be removed in response for card disadvantage, as with any aura. Now, this seems like the \u201cdies to doom blade\u201d argument- as in, not a very strong one- but for a control/combo deck, this is actually devastating. They spend one card, you lose two. This is the weakest point of the argument, as the upside of them  not  removing the creature is pretty insane (as in, you win). \n \n It creates issues with the combo. Now, this may sound incredibly dumb considering the combo is literally named after it, but hear me out. The All-In Twin lists run the classic 8/8 combo: they can run up to 8 of each piece if they want: \n \n \n 4 Deceiver Exarch \n 4 Pestermite \n 4 Splinter Twin \n 4 Kiki-Jiki, Mirror Breaker \n All you need to do to win is pair one of the blue cards with one of the red cards, and if it resolves you have an infinite combo. Now, for UWR Twin, this is slightly different. Some decks run Village Bell-Ringer (more on this later), but for the purposes of this post I am referring to the lists that run Restoration Angel for the infinite combo. For simplicity, assume we want to run 8/8 in UWR Twin: \n 4 Deceiver Exarch \n 4 Restoration Angel \n 4 Splinter Twin \n 4 Kiki-Jiki, Mirror Breaker \n See the problem? You can pair Exarch with any of the red cards for your combo just the same as before. Restoration Angel, on the other hand, only combos with Kiki-Jiki. You can put Splinter Twin on your angel, but it won\u2019t give you an infinite combo unless you also have a Deceiver Exarch on the field (blink Exarch, untap angel, etc, but this is messy and not a great play in most circumstances). This means that half of one piece of your combo does not actually combo with half of another piece. This problem only becomes worse once you look at what most UWR Twin lists actually run, where they only run two copies of Kiki-Jiki, Mirror Breaker. \n What this means, then, is that Splinter Twin is a dead card in a lot of situations. Sometimes you don\u2019t draw Deceiver Exarch. Sometimes your opponent plays Pithing Needle naming Deceiver Exarch. Sure, you can put Splinter Twin on your Wall of Omens \u2013 this is a sweet play that feels great every time you draw two cards a turn \u2013 but what this means is that once again, you\u2019re setting yourself up to get 2 for 1ed, and you also force yourself to draw another copy of Splinter Twin. \n After a few months of testing, this problem manifested itself in various ways, but I was never really able to pinpoint what exactly the problem was. Was it me? Was it the deck? Was it bad luck, or bad matchups? Then Grand Prix Minneapolis came along, and I saw Shaun McClaren\u2019s \u201cKiki Control\u201d [list](  This is UWR Twin, without the Splinter Twin. It\u2019s UWR Control, with an infinite combo built in. It ditches Deceiver Exarch and Splinter Twin for control cards, and it can still combo off. \n From my understanding, UWR Twin was designed because it was the Twin combo- super powerful, popular, and good in the Modern metagame- but with a good control backup plan. You can win with Celestial Colonnade or Restoration Angel beatdown, and you have some of the best removal and sideboard tech to back it up. But why water down the deck with Splinter Twin when you can have a stronger control deck with a combo that\u2019s just as game-ending? In my time with UWR Twin, I found the deck to be less a control deck and more a combo deck with better removal. This is good for Modern, to be sure, and the backup plan of Restoration Angel and Celestial Colonnade won me many games- but these games I was usually left with a Splinter Twin stranded in my hand. Why not turn this into a card that\u2019s actually useful? \n In short, I think UWR Twin is best without the Twin. I\u2019ve been testing for a few weeks with a slightly modified version of McClaren\u2019s list, and my testing has shown it to be far more consistent and powerful. There aren\u2019t any awkward draws as far as the combo goes, because we\u2019ve streamlined the combo down to seven cards (4/3 split). Ditching Splinter Twin for actual spells also has the side benefit of making Snapcaster Mage more powerful by giving him more potential targets. \n A few final words: My lack of substantial time with the deck may be making a huge difference, so feel free to disagree and discuss this further. I hope you do disagree, actually- seeing other people\u2019s points of view is one of the best ways to grow as a player, as I see it. \n There is also the question of Village Bell-Ringer. This combos with both Splinter Twin and Kiki-Jiki, Mirror Breaker. I briefly toyed with replacing Restoration Angel with this, and looked at Cifka\u2019s WR Twin list found  here . Now, I haven\u2019t tested with Village Bell-Ringer yet, and he might be bonkers. The way I see it, however, is that he\u2019s little more than a worse version of Deceiver Exarch. Deceiver Exarch is great because he can tap down a threat (or a Tron land in the upkeep, if you get desperate), or untap your own threat or land for removal/countermagic. Village Bell-Ringer does not do these things, and his effect isn't really that great unless you're comboing. By replacing Restoration Angel with Village Bell-Ringer, the deck gets even less control focused, and loses a fantastic backup wincon. It just isn\u2019t as good. There may still be room for dedicated UWR Twin without Angel as a more combo focused list with better removal, but for now I think Kiki-Control is just a better choice for power and consistency. \n Thanks for reading.": "ModernMagic",

            "I've got a few mildly interesting factoids to share. This is gonna be kinda long. \n \n I have three sisters; two are older, one is younger. Because my father was something of a workaholic (or maybe just afraid of being at home), I was usually the only male in the house at any given time. As such, I've never been a \"manly\" man, which I'm totally okay with. My oldest sister is 7 years older than me. My middle sister is 2.5 years older than me. My little sister is 6 years younger. Many of us didn't have much in common. \n \n When I was in high school learning biology, I asked my blonde, green-eyed father and my blonde, hazel-eyed mother how my oldest sister had brown hair and brown eyes. Apparently, she got them from her father, who was not my father. Who knew? It turns out, none of my sisters realized anything was wrong on their own and instead they were told at an arbitrary age. My older sister freaked out significantly more than any of the rest of us, including the eldest who had just found her dad wasn't her father. I was more bothered by the fact that my parents' marriage is older than my sister. Apparently they were separated at the time. What's more, there's a pattern of this in my family. My father, my grandfather, and my uncle have all adopted their wives children. When my fiance and I get married, I'll be carrying on that tradition. \n \n My older sisters have both been divorced twice. Their respective first husbands were cousins. Both of their second marriages were ended within months for basically the same reasons. My eldest sister is now in a stable, committed relationship with a guy who isn't a horrible person. My older sister just got married again to the first person she's dated in years that wasn't a total jackwad. We're hoping these two'll be the last. \n \n My middle sister and my younger sister joined the Army a few months apart. There's a funny story about push-ups in here somewhere. Both of them got stationed at the same base for basic training (which incidentally is where my fiance went to basic). Both of them were medically discharged before basic was over due to massive fractures. Both of them tried to fight it and finish despite the pain. I like to tell people the Army broke my sisters. My maternal grandfather also got medically discharged from the Army almost immediately after basic training. \n \n On the subject, my father was a Marine and almost saw combat in Vietnam, except the forces were pulled out right before he'd have deployed. His older brother served in the Army, but wasn't deployed to Vietnam (he's later became a Methodist minister, did some missionary work in Russia, and is a published author of religious fiction). His younger brother joined the Air Force where he worked for many years as a doctor (he is, far as I know, still working for NASA where he used to give physicals to astronauts to make sure they were space-worthy. He said it was incredibly boring, as half of them are doctors themselves and incredibly healthy.) My paternal grandfather served in the Navy during Korea. One of my cousins joined the Coast Guard recently, meaning that within those three generations, they hit each of the service branches. \n \n \n And a few shorties: \n \n I found out last night at age 28 what my aunt's name is. Apparently she goes by her middle name. \n \n An unspecifiable member of my family may or may not have been involved with the government in ways that I'm not allowed to talk about. Honestly, I don't know. All I have are rumour and speculation and people who \"don't want to talk about it.\" \n \n Between my mother's and father's families, I have ancestors who are  moderately famous politicians, judges, outlaws, thieves, and at least one folk hero.": "Random_Acts_Of_Amazon",
            "So I've never really looked into the familiar rules because I find familiars generally pretty cumbersome and don't use them if I can avoid it, but I have a new wizard being built in a game I'm DMing and something I was unaware of has been brought to my attention. I want to make sure that my new understanding of it is correct. \n Anything with an intelligence of three or more gets a feat at its first HD, and another feat every two after that, according to the monster manual. Familiars have a HD equal to the base creature or the wizard, whichever is higher. So my players new 6th-level wizard has a hedgehog familiar with HP equal to half the wizard's HP and 6HD for all other purposes. So the hedgehog should have the feat it starts out with plus two more, and another one next level? The whole \"more feats with more HD\" thing makes sense when prebuilt into the monster manual, and it makes sense when advancing a monster, but the thought never occurred to me to apply it to familiars. If that's the case, does the player pick the feats? Does the DM pick the feats? What about creatures that get \"bonus\" feats in their stat block? Familiars with feats? Really?": "Pathfinder_RPG",
            "I use it a lot for half a dozen different games. The only real weakness to speak of for me is the generally crappy tokens they offer you. Fortunately, this is offset by the ability to upload your own, but if the characters throw you for a loop midsession, it can be difficult to pull something out that looks or feels right. Still, that's my only complaint. \n The list of things made easier by Roll20 is pretty extensive though. Like a lot of people, none of my groups use it for voice or video. It's not that it's terrible, it's just that skype/vent/whatever else is better. The freedom that characters have over their sheets, tokens, and macros, however, make it playable in any format I've tried so far. The level of control the GM has over all of that stuff plus maps, npcs, journals, forums, music... it makes DMing more fun online than in person for me, because I can get the ambiance and visual depth of a game without lots of time and money spent collecting minis and building terrain I may only need once. What's more, because I can draw (even if the draw tool takes a little getting used to), I can come up with stuff on the fly when I need to and still have it adequately represented. \n My biggest tip would be to make sure you've got a character sheet set up. Not only does it allow you to talk in character, as /u/mitovmeio mentioned, but it allows macro customization based on stats put into the character sheet itself, so that changing one number on the sheet automatically changes all of the rolls that use that stat. The games can be run without macros, but I've found that the more time you spend macrocrafting beforehand, the less time you spend looking up numbers and figuring out rolls during play. \n I would definitely, especially if you're going to be GMing, recommend creating a blank campaign for testing purposes. Go in, look at how things work, read and watch the tutorials to figure out how to put things together. It's also incredibly useful if you want to test macros in other games without showing them on the chat screen for whatever reason. Even if you're not GMing, it's a good idea just to see have an idea what the GM sees and what he or she is capable of within the system. \n Last, but not least, if you want to run a campaign with a lot of tension,  dungeon delving, horror, or the like, it's worth giving them that $5 a month for the extra options it gives you. Dynamic Lighting is a lot of fun to play around with and can really add something to the game.

Whether he is ifrit himself or something more is unclear (the description leans toward him being an actual efreet, but that would make her half-genie instead of ifrit). He has, at the very least, high intelligence and charisma, and a high level of arcane power (though the source of that power could be anything) with a focus on fire and mind-affecting spells. He is also fond of fighting with two whips (which is what makes the build so much more difficult). \n My initial build was a level of Aristocrat, followed by 7 levels of Efreeti-bloodline Sorcerer and 9 levels of Eldritch Knight.

            "When working in religion, I tried to approach it from an old-timey angle. Considering five of the seven divine beings in my setting are direct manifestations of Greco-Roman gods, it made sense that they're worship was also Greco-Roman, meaning constant and never ending. Religion is a very large part of society. When you take into account that six of the gods are \"elemental\" and directly contribute to the magic that permeates the world, they become an even bigger deal. Metaphysically speaking, the gods exist only because they are worshipped, which means it is in their best interest to keep themselves in the forefront of society's collective consciousness. \n Of course, this creates a few \"problems.\" While they certainly don't need to be in constant communication with anyone in particular, and while they don't need to be \"aware\" to grant spells or anything like that, they have plenty of reason to appear to mortals. However, they prefer not to. Given the choice, they prefer a hands-off method, because continuously striking fear and/or awe into the entire world is exhausting. Due to heavy campaigning in the past, knowledge and understanding of the divine is something the people take for granted. They know the gods exist even if they've never directly interacted with one, or even know of anyone who has. There's always the rumour that this or that god appeared to bless a large ceremony held in their honor a few kingdoms over. \n Certain things do require the direct intervention of the gods. Avid non-believers and blasphemers tend to be put in their place, out of a necessary divine survival instinct. Happenings of global and historical importance often garner a visit from a divine or two, although usually not in front of a large crowd. The sudden manifestation of a war diety telling you to cool your jets is often enough to stop any would-be conqueror in their tracks. These kinds of ploys are only brought out, however, if there is great need. \n To help reinforce belief, various phenomenon are attributed to the gods. Visions and prophecies are considered divine. Significant natural phenomena are seen as god-sent omens. All manner of fortune tellers read cards and bones and what have you to divine the will of the gods. In reality, the gods have nothing to do with any of that. They allow the belief to continue, though, because it reinforces their existence. \n Like their Greek inspirations, the gods are not all-powerful. They are not all-knowing. They are in many ways as human as their followers, but immortal and possessing power far beyond that of the greatest of mortals. They have enough power to rule the world, or destroy it outright. Many have wondered why the don't. What the mortal population is unaware of (and what the gods themselves aren't fully aware of) is that there are limitations on godhood. Mortals answer to the divine and the divine answers to an even higher authority they are only marginally aware of, an authority the mortals know nothing of and would have difficulty comprehending. That authority still answers to the laws of the universe, which in turn answer to the creator of the universe (me), and so on, in a neverending cycle.": "rpg",

The local paladin brigade shows up and demands that I disarm and surrender peacefully to be blah blah blahed. I ignore him.

He smiles, showing his pointed teeth, then throws a mug at each of the two underlings and jumps at the plate-clad head paladin, grappling him.

            "Had a tough time at the only semi-regular (like once ever 2 months) game that I actually get to  play  in. \nOk two things:\n1) Why are all the other players so slow in D&D. I'm playing a ranger and my turn is about 20-30 seconds. There's a wizard, a sorcoress a cleric and a paladin who's turns are like frigging chessmasters. Why can they not plan their go during the other turns? I realise that some things are conditional but seriously. I know some classes are a bit more complex than others but at level 2 there's not that much to choose from. \n 2) I think I've had enough of this campaign and I don't know how to do it without upsetting the DM. He's a cool dude the game is just not engaging and really boring. Initial characters were shot down - we had a rather limited selection of races to choose from which to an extent was fine. He wanted a tonne of backstory and detail, we thought not too crunch driven, but no it's highly crunch driven. With average rolls my min/maxed ranger (+9 to hit at level 2) still would miss the enemies today. The rest of the party weren't too hot.\nEveryone else was bored. We have basically been exploring and apparantly 'not following any hooks' - none of which are given. If there's 2 roads - 1 labelled 'death lies this way' and our objective is to find a safe route WE'RE NOT GOING TO TAKE THE DEATH ROAD. \n No one seems to be enjoying it. I'm bored out of my skull and wasted 5 hours of my life when I could have spent them with my visiting family.

            "Firstly decide on 40k or fantasy. \nGo to a GW and play the demo game.

The skaven half is better but you'll need A LOT more skaven to have a somewhat viable army.\nThe 40k set is a bit better but again unless you want chaos or dark angels I would avoid it. \nReason being you can pick up the mini rulebook on ebay for ~\u00a310, leaving you with the ~\u00a360 towards an army you actually want (eg a battleforce)\nHOWEVER if you  do  want one of the armies in the starter boxes (high elves, skaven, dark angels or chaos) then the starter boxes are a bargain PLUS you can swap one half for another and be doing pretty well! \n Paint wise - it depends on what you'll be painting - there is no point getting 4 different shades of green if you're painting red chaos marines! \n You can get cheaper primer from a hardware shop, vallejho paints are cheaper and you get more volume however GW 'base' paints are great, combine them with some washes and you get a relatively easy to paint but good looking force.": "Warhammer",

The players start out in a crater with no memory of what the hell is going on. The planar system is set up like the malazan book of the fallen. Tieflings have the same backstory as the Twili from Zelda, and Dragonborn don't actually... \"exist\" (they're future dragons that took on a smaller form to survive). \n It turns out the players are sent from the future to save the worlds. Some chaos sorcerer found a way to mitigate his power by designing a \"chaos orb\" which absorbs the chaotic energy and organizes it into manageable magic. Unfortunately over time it's polarity swaps and it starts pumping out chaos. Over the millennia it will be the cause of all the universe's destruction. The god of Past law wants the orb, and Future Law wants it destroyed.

            "I've been running a game of Shadowrun for a few weeks now, set in London in 2062, using a self-made hack of Edge of the Empire. Edge is mostly low-progression, the hack is even lower progression because I'm using a Burning Wheel-esque skill advancement system (basically you advance skills by using them). Accordingly, I've been using a mostly mission-based Karma system. I set a number of objectives, the players set a number of objectives, for each one completed at the end of the mission, they all get one Karma. But for some smaller, session by session progression, I liked the general spirit as well as the Karma output in Teamworker/MVP/Embodiment so decided to use those. \n Essentially, the players vote, I abstain, the only rule is that anyone who nominates themselves is disqualified; this prevents the loudest players from getting all the Karma. I thought it would work well. It doesn't work with my group. I'm not going to directly say it doesn't work without an audience, but essentially, more than once the players have decided \"well, no one really made an important roll this session\" and, \"I think we all worked as a team equally\"; then after the session players come to me privately and say how they thought they deserved the award but they weren't able to voice their case because of my rule. The system is broken, essentially. Bear in mind, this isn't a problem group at all, they're great, it's the mechanic that's causing the problem. \n If you have any recommendations for how to rectify the above problem and make the award system work on a session basis with a small group, I'd really appreciate it. \n In the meantime, I've decided to draw from Burning Wheel again (and, of course, in part, Mirrorshades) with Beliefs, Instincts and Traits. The Players are still trying to feel out who their characters are and I think Beliefs will help to guide them, Instincts are just a mechanic I love and Traits, well. I wasn't going to use Goals from Mirrorshades, because the players already have mission goals, instead I came up with a way to do Traits that kind of melds Burning Wheel Traits and Apocalypse World Highlights. \n At the beginning of each session, each player has a Trait highlighted for their character. This isn't from a list in the book or something on their character sheet, it's simply, a one-word trait of their character another player has noticed. At the end of the sesssion, as per Burning Wheel, if it caused negative consequences, they gain one Karma. \n I think this will help other players to engage with the personality of the other characters, tell them what they like about them and what they'd like to see more of and of course, make things interesting. The details are a bit cloudy, for example: who decides on the Trait for each player? Is it just the other three players? What if they name a Trait that the player feels that their character simply does not have? Should that player just be allowed to veto it? If so, does that mean they don't get a Trait for that session, or the other players name another Trait? \n One more problem I have is that this is now 3 Karma per session each they can get. That's a lot. That's far higher progression than I want. Should I restrict it so they can only score one per session? That seems like a poor solution. \n ...at the end of that wall of text.": "itmejp",
            "The background:  So, I'm currently running a campaign of Shadowrun. After some hijinks, the players have found themselves hired to find and kill cyberpunk Jack the Ripper (long story). They think that he has been using this hotel as a hideout, which they discover is more or less a ghoul den (ghouls are humans infected with this virus that makes them blind, makes their flesh rot and makes them crave human flesh). But they aren't feral, most are perfectly cognizant, they are just trying to keep to themselves because everyone utterly reviles all Infected (ghouls are one example of this). \n The manager is also a ghoul and the players strike up a conversation, taking a number of very strange tacks that I won't go into but suffice to say, the Face kind of views getting an NPC to do what he wants like a square/triangle/circle hole and if one fails he just switches to the next. Essentially, the manager more or less tells them that yes, this guy was/is living here, not in so many words. But he also says that there is no way that he will help them catch them because the guy apparently protects them, supports them and may even own the hotel, it's unclear. He gives them the basement key to go and speak to the ghouls down there though, as that is where the players suspect that Jack has been secretly leaving the hotel from. \n So, they go down into the complete and utter darkness. Low-light vision? No light. Thermographic vision? Too bad ghoul bodies are room temperature. They have a torch though! They kind of fumble through and after trying to get the ghouls to show themselves the Face, for some reason thinking he is in a position to threaten the pack of ghouls in the ghoul den, says, \"perhaps we should start a fire then!\" Terrible mistake. If there's something ghouls are more afraid of than people, it's fire, and when ghouls get afraid, they don't run, they get feral. Needless to say, their attempt to get information out of the ghouls ends with them running out of the basement, but the ghouls don't chase them any further. \n The Face rams his head against the manager some more with some pretty good rolls and the manager basically says, if they go and  stop  this gang that has been harassing ghouls in the sewers, he will help them if it wouldn't compromise the home the ghouls have in any way. \n Here's the problem:  So, because the other characters hate ghouls, only the Face went on a solo mission to do this and at the end of the last session was getting driven into the middle of nowhere in the trunk of a car. He can get out of this, even succeed at his mission! But then he's going to back to the manager who is going to keep up his end of the bargain, help him if it wouldn't compromise the hotel. Funnily enough, helping them kill the guy who the manager thinks is an executive at the corporation that owns the hotel (he is sort of wrong but not completely) will compromise the hotel in his opinion. \n After the Face went to all this trouble, I don't want to just stomp on his dreams. But this ghoul does not care even a little that this guy is Jack the Ripper. All he cares about himself and his ghoul friends. And as far as he is concerned, these shadowrunners are the prime threat to them.": "rpg",
            "For those curious what that acronym meant: Dungeon World-Perilous Wilds-West Marches. You know what Dungeon World is, Perilous Wilds is a supplement published by Lampblack & Brimstone that adds expanded rules for wilderness travel, followers and world creation as well as a wealth of advice for running games based around land traversal. West Marches is a type of campaign which was one of the inspirations for Perilous Wilds based on a blog post by Ben Robbins, which combines a hex-crawl game with a very fluid cast of players. \n I run an open game in a pub. Due to its location and format, it demands that first of all, it be simple and fast, second of all, that it is perfectly content with players dropping in and out from session to session. I've been using Blades in the Dark for about six months, but since then a third demand on the game has appeared: that it function as well with three players per session as it does with upwards of five. Unfortunately, from my experience, Blades in the Dark is best played with 3-4 players per session and gets worse the more players you have. \n So, I turn to this West Marches-style game, using Dungeon World because of its simplicity. \n I'm a big believer in logically justifying the idea of the game; it ruins my sense of immersion if things don't have an internal logical consistency, especially if they're built on a central conceit that simply makes no sense. The base conceit I'd like to stick with is that the player characters are trapped on \"an unknown landmass\" with the ruins of a lost civilisation and strange underground complexes scattered across the landscape. \n The three pillars would be subsistence, the establishment of a \"home base\" and of course, adventuring. Perhaps, in the future, a fourth pillar of conflict with other \"elements\" trapped on this landmass. I intend to hack the game to sustain the first two ideas and don't need help with that right now, what I do need help with, is how to justify the other core elements of Dungeon World while retaining the central conceit. \n \n Towns. There is no imperative to establish their own home on the landscape if there is civilisation they can easily access, not to mention eliminating the concern of subsistence and survival on an antagonistic landscape.  \n Tied to the above, coin. If there is no civilisation, there is no need for coin. My current idea is to replace coin with some sort of \"memory shards\" they can use to mystically repair their home base, which will start off as a ruin just like others on the landscape. \n Followers. I can explain why there are other humans, elves, etc. on this landmass, they likely got there the same way the player characters did. But the vast majority of all \"Costs\" as defined by The Perilous Wilds e.g. debauchery, lucre would be rather hard to come by. I suppose I could just cut these out? \n Rations. Do I force the players to scavenge rations on the landscape? If not, how do I give a cost to them without coin? \n Fighters, Clerics, Rogues...I'd like to explain why all these heroic figures happen to be here.": "DungeonWorld",
            "This may have been entirely inspired by a discussion I had in a similarly titled thread. I'm thinking about running a slightly hacked Stars Without Number game to aid in a campaign resembling that of Dark Heresy. So far I'm just conceptualising changes while I poke at interest for something like this. If you're interested in fighting the grim darkness of the far future as Inquisitorial agents with the sandbox simplicity of the Stars Without Number system, or you know someone who does, please let me know. \n To detail some of the mechanical changes to better suit the setting I'm considering: \n I plan to alter character creation to suit the Dark Heresy 2E flavour of Choose Homeworld, Choose Background, Choose Role. It will  mostly  just prove an aesthetic change. I also plan to rebalance the Psyker class, other than its name, to suit the more deadly nature of psychic powers in the 40K universe. In the spirit of that, I'll add a Sanity-esque system. \n Key differences from a Dark Heresy campaign would be that although you are agents of the Inquisition, you are not allowed to reveal that fact, no Inquisitorial seal either. My concept is that the Sector has been cut off entirely from the Imperium and at the start of The Incision, as it was called, the Inquisition decided to obfuscate the fact that there was ever an Inquisition presence in the Sector, in order to serve their needs of secrecy when rooting out corruption. \n Faction power in this sector is dramatically different from that of the regular Imperium, for example, the Adeptus Mechanicus is the dominant power in the sector while the Adeptus Arbites and Imperial Guard forces who were in the Sector at the time have merged to form the Adeptus Pacifici Unitum; essentially pirates and extortionists who masquerade as peacekeepers. \n Your characters are supposed to just resemble freebooters, traipsing around the sector on your ship. In fact, there may well be long periods where an Inquisitor does not contact you and will very rarely offer you support during these, so you may have to be real freebooters sometimes. Also, clearly distinct from Dark Heresy, the premise is not: you are Inquisitorial agents. The premise is: you are Inquisitorial agents right now. \n You may have  very good  reasons to stay that way, but I'm not going to stop you from abandoning them if you're willing to face the consequences. And they won't be: lol ur dead, consequences. They will be: very powerful people want you dead, consequences. As you may have seen in Swan Song, it's possible to stay alive for a long time in such situations. \n A side note on the science of 40K: due to the strange nature of the Warp in this sector, small ships are capable of Warp jumps. \n The": "skinnyghost"

            "Good evening and thanks for clicking.  Sorry for the long post. \n I've been working on \"Practical Kriegspiel\" for a month or so now.  The original \"Kriegspiel\" was used to train Prussian military officers in the early 1800s and has since been adapted in many forms by modern armies across the world. \n In the original, opposing players play on separate tables and transmit all of their moves through one or more \"confidants.\" The confidants resolve the resultant movement and combat with an incredibly complex set of tables, and then portray and describe the end state on each table while maintaining nigh-perfect fog of war between the players. \n The original takes a long time, but it opens up a whole new realm of wargaming possibility, one in which players are placed much closer to the actual sensation of uncertain, creative, and communicative battlefield command.  From the minute you get \"in the saddle,\" so to speak, as a player, you realize you are experiencing a very different game. \n \"Practical Kriegspiel\" is an attempt to greatly speed up play, bringing the game into a conceivable 1-3 hour time-span, while also reinforcing the core concepts of the original classic.  To accomplish this, the \"Confidants\" of \"Practical Kriegspiel\" are called upon to act a little bit more like rpg game-masters. \n The rpg elements come in when the confidants are resolving action on the battlefield.  Instead of giving themselves over to hundreds of charts, they are given freedom to interpret the scene as they see fit, guided by rolls made on a set of \"Friction\" tables.  Here's a draft of one such table: \n When a unit moves across the battlefield\u2026 \n roll 1D6\nadd 1D6 if the unit is crossing difficult terrain\nadd 1D6 for each \"Disorganized\" Friction the unit currently carries \n 1-no effect\n2-subtract .25 miles from the unit's movement allowance\n3-subtract .25 miles from the unit\u2019s movement allowance\n4-the unit gains the persistent Friction \u201cDisorganized\u201d\n5-the unit gains the persistent Friction \u201cDisheartened\u201d\n6-the unit gains the persistent Friction \"Light Casualties\" \n You might think of the various Friction tables as compendiums of \"partial success\" results as seen in the *World series of games. \n So, as units move around the battlefield, and accumulate the results of Frictions like \"When a unit receives rifle fire...\", the confidant is responsible for ascribing a believable story to the effects of the Frictions and describing the end state to the players. \n Units are described by Tags and Frictions.  Tags come with the unit at start.  Tags like \"Understrength\" and \"Resolute\" describe the limits of the unit's morale and manpower, while other Tags, like \"Assault Veterans\" grant modifiers on the various Friction tables. \n Confidants also have the responsibility of role-playing as the non-player officers surrounding the players.  The officers have their own personality-describing Tags which influence command-related Frictions.  The Confidant resolves those Frictions, but is also called upon to move and fight with the npoffciers' units in a believable way based on player input. \n I think that about sums it up.

To be clear, though, we didn\u2019t ask or suggest that he resign\u2014he decided to when we didn\u2019t approve the new office plan. \n > We wish him the best and we\u2019re thankful for the work he\u2019s done to grow reddit more than 5x. \n > I am delighted to announce the new team we have in place.  Ellen Pao will be stepping up to be interim CEO.  Because of her combination of vision, execution, and leadership, I expect that she\u2019ll do an incredible job. \n > Alexis Ohanian, who cofounded reddit nine and a half years ago, is returning as full-time executive chairman (he will transition to a part-time partner role at Y Combinator).  He will be responsible for marketing, communications, strategy, and community. \n > There is a long history of founders returning to companies and doing great things.  Alexis probably knows the reddit community better than anyone else on the planet.  He had the original product vision for the company and I\u2019m excited he\u2019ll get to finish the job.  Founders are able to set the vision for their companies with an authority no one else can. \n > Dan McComas will become SVP Product.  Dan founded redditgifts, where in addition to building a great product he built a great culture, and has already been an integral part of the reddit team\u2014I look forward to seeing him impact the company more broadly. \n > Although my 8 days as the CEO of reddit have been sort of fun, I am happy they are coming to a close and I am sure the new team will do a far better job and take reddit to great heights.  It\u2019s interesting to note that during my very brief tenure, reddit added more users than Hacker News has in total. \n From Yishan: \n > All of the reasons that Sam Altman has outlined in public are true.  I know it sounds somewhat unbelieveable because it's so weird, but if it was made up, I think any PR person would have come up with a better made-up story. \n > If there is a deeper reason, it is this: \n > The job as CEO of reddit is incredibly stressful and draining.  After two and a half years, I'm basically completely worn out, and it was having significantly detrimental effects on my personal life.  If anything, I probably pushed myself way too far - as a first-time CEO, all I knew was that such jobs are supposed to be stressful, so I never really had a good baseline, i.e. how stressful is too stressful, until multiple outside people and coaches I was working with remarked to me that I looked incredibly worn down for months on end and it wasn't supposed to be this hard. \n > On the office location issue: it's probably something we could have worked out.  I feel the board is a very supportive and friendly one, but we had a strategic disagreement wherein I felt that locating an office in San Francisco proper is an increasingly difficult thing given the strains the city is facing and the high rents it imposes on employees who wish to live close to the office.  On the other hand, many of our current employees live there so the proposal to find an office location just outside the city (Daly City is immediately to the southwest outside of SF) was very unpopular, and there are plenty of startups who locate in SF and are very successful.  If the job had been a energizing one rather than one that had been so draining, this probably wouldn't have been an issue I resigned over.  But it was, and I'd be lying if I said I wasn't relieved to have the burden off my shoulders. \n > I am very optimistic about the new team! When I first took the job, I specifically asked for Alexis to be included on the board and I'm happy he's able to make the time now to be more involved as executive chairman.  I also personally hired Ellen Pao myself.  She is a close friend and one of the most capable executives I've ever worked with, and I hope she'll become the permanent CEO.  I'm also happy that Dan McComas is returning to the Bay Area with his team from Salt Lake City (he and his wife were originally from Alameda when reddit first acquired redditgifts) to lead our new product organization - this was a decision we'd made before my decision to resign.  Finally, Sam Altman and the other investors have been very supportive this whole time even through our disagreement and I think it's a great set of allies that reddit will have going forward. \n > Finally, I look forward to being able to go back to using reddit again as a regular user. \n EDIT:": "OutOfTheLoop",
            "I hope the mods don't consider this to be \"concern trolling.\"  I'm working from a statement made in the posting rules: \"Our discussion is not meant to be just an echo chamber, we absolutely encourage discussion that challenges commonly held beliefs.\" \n My main point of discussion is this: the Red Pill will not generate long-term positive results for individuals or for society. \n The problems that the Red Pill attempts to solve are not really problems. \n A woman's ability to choose her own mate, a.k.a. \"ride the cock carousel\" is not a bad thing.  The rise of womens' agency over the past 100 years or so has coincided with lower birth rates, lower infant mortality rates, lower proportionate deaths due to domestic abuse, and more.  On the other hand, when women outnumber men and men are thus able to pick partners almost at will, i.e. among black populations in East New York, Chicago, and Cincinnati in the 50s and 60s, families break down or never form and whole communities suffer. \n Also, womens' rights and privileges simply do not outpace mens' rights and privileges.  Look around you--that concept fails the basic reasonableness test.  Women are gaining social status in many parts of the globe, sure, but men undoubtedly have it better when it comes to being able to earn money and, perhaps more importantly, walk down the street without fear.  There is no dragon for Red Pillers to slay, only an inchworm. \n And, this one particularly irks me: the alpha/beta dichotomy is overly simplistic.  There is a major lack of scholarship on this as a facet of human behavior.  It describes wolves and hippopotamuses, y'all, and even in that realm scientists are conflicted.  Sure, some elements of human behavior might remind you of your limited understanding of the scientific concept, but that doesn't mean that you should view everything through that same lens.  Humans are different from other animals!  The things that govern attraction in a human society bear little resemblance to the behavior of a pack of timberwolves.  Take humor, empathy, and salary as three obvious differences that would come to you if you considered your framework for more than five seconds. \n Furthermore, there is no indication that a Red Pill world is preferable to a Blue Pill world, or that it is preferable to whatever middle ground we have now.  There is nothing but emotion disguised as rationality, pettiness, and narcissism to justify a Red Pill world. \n Almost all of human history up to this point has been characterized by dominant males and subservient females.  Given the data collected thus far, it is difficult to prove that it's not worth at least trying to bring a more feminine outlook to policy-making and diplomacy. \n Why should men be elevated above women in the first place?  There is no proof that a man's world is better than a woman's world.  There are women out there who are more successful, more rational, more \"alpha\" than any of us.  Men should not jump to the conclusion that they are inherently more valuable than women. \n The Red Pill worldview justifies violence and coercion.  By conceptualizing women as less than men, we permit actions that are offensive to basic human dignity.  Things like threatening to throw someone out of your hotel room if they don't have sex with you, or interpreting \"no\" as \"last minute resistance\" surmountable by escalation, or applauding people who beat girls up, or just run-of-the-mill \"plate spinning\" all violate the ethic of reciprocity that should govern human relationships. \n Finally, on a personal note, swallowing the Red Pill short-circuits deeper understanding and is harmful to \"inner game.\"  It's one framework by which to evaluate human interaction, which is not fully quantifiable by any framework.  If you go through life treating slightly more than half of the world's population \"like children\" (quoting the top post on here today), you absolutely will not acquire the depth and breadth of knowledge, experience, and understanding that makes for a compelling personality.  You personally will only be satisfied with yourself if your brain is small enough to be satisfied with such a deficient diet, and you will struggle to maintain the interest of the people around you. \n The Red Pill framework is based on false and skewed understandings of human relationships.  Don't let it be your polestar. \n Sorry for the wall of text.  I'm more than happy to discuss this further within the comments.": "TheRedPill",
            "Edit 3:  u/grapeban , and in which a false allegation would be burned into a husk in micro-seconds.  My view is changed to agree with the 2-8% rate for false allegations that end up in front of the police.  Thanks so much to Grape and to all who joined the discussion! \n OP below: \n I have been struck by the bloggers and talking heads all repeating the 2% figure, while at the same time I was reading accounts by trial lawyers who all seemed to place the rate much higher.  With no agenda, I grew curious about this statistic and checked into it. \n The overwhelming consensus is that the 2% rate is a fiction.  There is no extant study that comes to a conclusion of 2%.  It was an anecdotal figure, possibly from the 1970s, that got bounced around the academic echo chamber until it gained artificial weight.  Check [here]( for a good overview of the issue. \n The [FBI]( puts the rate of \"unfounded\" allegations at 8%.  It should be remembered, however, that the FBI collects that data by simply polling police departments nationwide, and each department has its own threshold for \"unfounding\" an allegation, which adds a lot of murkiness to the figure. I think the 8% rate tells us more about police procedures than anything concrete about the actual amount of false claims.  Nevertheless, the 8% rate means that rape allegations are deemed unfounded four times more often than allegations of any other crime. \n A [peer-reviewed study]( that I consider quite convincing was performed in 1994 by a Eugene Kanin of Purdue University.  He studied one town from the years of 1978-1987 and two universities from the years of 1985-1988.  In all three of those places, violent felonies were rare and all rape allegations were pursued to closure.  The only basis for unfounding an allegation was the recantation of the accuser.  The false accusation rate was 41% in the town and 50% between the two universities. \n The consensus also seems to be that the overall number of false claims will always be a \"dark,\" i.e. unknowable, figure.  That is certainly true, although I think Kanin's study comes the closest to shedding real light on that figure.  I think we are looking at something closer to Kanin's figures, maybe a little lower generally speaking, as the real rate of false claims.": "changemyview"

(Playing the XCOM drinking game? Take a shot!) The soldier in question was blasted, and became critically wounded. I've been playing the game on \"only one save per battle,\" and I'd managed to capture a live Muton. If that soldier died and going \"well that sucks, shouldn't have relied on a 95% chance to hit, restart,\" I felt I had a bunch of options again. I could spend a bunch of turns getting my medic over to him while covering them. I could take even more risks to end the mission before the soldier bled out, but there's no telling how long it would have taken to find every alien on the map. I decided to get my medic over and stabilize him. \n Once he was put back on active duty, he started to panic more often when he took damage. (I tried to avoid it, but that silly 95%...!) I know that critically wounded soldiers permanently lose will, causing them to panic more, etc. I stopped bringing him on missions, never knowing if his \"near-death experience\" would cause him to panic in a critical situation.

            "One thing to know about this game is that timing and surprises are everything (one of the reason that Growth is considered OP, and Energy is \"UP\"). Growth always has a variety of surprises, and Energy has less. \n Many cards synergize with Great Wolf. Ragged Wolf can add +1 damage in a different row, and boosts Great Wolf on a turn when it has 0 cooldown. Mangy Wolf is like a Rallying for Wolves, and also adds +1 damage to Great Wolf. \n Cards with Haste are powerful, as are cards with 1 cooldown (Kinsfolk Brave/Wildling). \n Rallying is a knock-out surprise that can be used to clear boards, or kill idols one turn quicker. Crimson Bull is the same way. God Hand is the ultimate surprise. \n === \n I think one mistake you might be making is playing scrolls as you get them. Rather than doing that, try sacrificing more scrolls for resources more often. Especially as Growth, you are incredibly threatening at 8 resources with God Hand (if you have them). With 7 resources, you can set up Rallying + Crimson Bull. \n If you have more resources, discarding for two scrolls is almost always the best play. If you only have 4 or 5 resources...you no longer get \"two\" plays a turn, and  instead you're digging for 1 for 1 answers. Instead of trying to survive  this  turn, instead discard an almost-useful tool for resources, and next turn discard that card to draw 2 answers (both of which you might be able to play). \n For instance, if you have 5 resources and no scrolls, and you draw a Crimson Bull (with only 1 or 2 units with CD0), you probably want to hold onto it. But if you discard it for resources, you start to threaten even more cards, bringing you closer to that magical 7-10 resources that let you almost always \"discard for 2 scrolls play both...or play God Hand which is two cards in one.\" And, should you draw two Rallying or Kinsfolk Veteran when you have 8 resources...well you've got a nice card for next turn.": "Scrolls",

            "Hey /r/starwarsarmada, \n Never done a tactica before, figured I'd start now. Also, I don't feel like I'm really coming up with any new thoughts, mostly just codifying knowledge better players already came up with... \n Squadrons suck. \n So the tactica I'm writing today is \"Squadrons Yesterday, Today, and Tomorrow.\" Let's get started! \n Why Do Squadrons Suck? \n Lots of people have been discussing this, let's parrot some of the major points here. \n \n Taking squadrons in your list makes you more vulnerable to being tabled. \n Using squadron commands means less commands for your ships. \n Any resources dedicated to countering squadrons is worthless if your opponent doesn't bring squadrons. \n Squadrons don't do anything better than ships of comparable value. \n \n Reason 1 is easy to understand. By tournament rules, if you have no ships on the table, you lose the game. More points in squadrons means less ships. Less ships means more vulnerable to instantly losing the game. \n Reason 2 is also easy to understand. A squadron command doesn't get any additional work done. It gives squadrons a move and an attack, which is something ships do by default. That command would likely be better as a concentrate fire command, which actually increases your damage output by adding more dice. \n Reason 3, while a meta call/environment call, shifts optimal decisions away from squadrons. If your opponent brings squadrons, but you don't bring anti-squadron tech, what's the worst that happens? You table him more easily and get a blowout 10-0 margin of victory win. Next time, he'll forgo the squadrons and bring more ships, making your little investment in anti-squadron tech not worth even the measly 30-40 points or so you've put in, meaning you cut them for better upgrades or another ship. \n Reason 4 is not a completely factual statement. Squadrons are easier to move. They have their own dice math. Upgrades exist to shepherd them and make them \"awesome.\" However, compounded with the other reasons, taking upgrades to make squadrons more like ships (Yavaris to attack twice, Admiral Chiraneu to make squadrons able to disengage) are probably just better spent taking a ship in the first place. See Reason 1, 2, and 3. \n Mitigating Squadron Problems \n \n Efficient squadrons only need apply. \n Flexible squadrons only. \n Self-sufficient squadrons. \n Bring squadrons that do something ships cannot. \n \n First, we'll want efficient squadrons. For now, expensive and complex combos involving squadrons aren't worth it when someone can take a Glad/Demolisher/ACM combo for the same points and ram it up your ass, table you, and win. \n Next, we want utility squadrons that can do everything, not just air superiority squadrons. Squadrons that are efficient at pinging ships first, and then maybe okay at attacking opposing squadrons second. \n Then we'll want to take self-sufficient squadrons. No need to shepherd them with squadron commands, no need to take upgrades to make them better. Get things done, on their own. \n Lastly, we'll want squadrons that can do something that ships can't. If your points would be better spent on a ship, you should probably put it into a ship. What are your points getting you that you wouldn't get in a ship? \n Rebel Squadrons Today (and How to Use Them) \n Taking all the above into account, there's unfortunately only one Rebel Squadron that works today. There were 3 of them in the second place Gen Con list. \n That's right, the A-Wing is probably the only Rebel squadron worth taking today. And given all the other problems with squadrons, it'll likely be the only Rebel squadron worth taking for a while. \n Let's frame why the A-Wing is worth taking by using the \"Four Problems With Squadrons\" as a baseline. \n \n A-Wings only cost 11 points. \n A-Wings move fast, and deal 1 battery damage at 75% chance. \n A-Wings don't need squadron commands to slingshot into position to attack. \n A-Wings allow you to attack with non-bomber black dice at long range. \n \n 1) A-Wings are efficient. At 11 points, they don't break the bank. The second-cheapest squadron the Rebels have access to, you can probably find room for 3 of them. 33 points is comparable to a naked CR90b at 39 points. \n 2) A-Wings are filled with utility. They have a movement of 5. They can jam other fighter wings during the early turns. They have Counter, to help damage people trying to free themselves from a jam. They have a 75% chance to do 1 battery damage against ships. \n 3) They're self-sufficient. They don't need combo pieces and upgrades to shine, their high move means that you can be where you need to be. Counter means you'll help clear a jam and you can be useful. The long range movement means you don't need a squadron command to pull off an attack on a ship, you can predict where their ship is going and simply move to where you need to be. \n 4) They do something ships don't. A squadron command will let you roll black battery dice at long range, a 75% chance to hit and deal one damage. A ship doing the same thing needs to be in close range, but also gains more damage output and crits. A squadron command for A-Wings brings something that ships don't have; black dice rolled at effective distance 6 of the A-Wings. \n Extra discussion of Rebel Aces. I think most of them are somewhat bad and rarely worth their increased cost, defense dice, or their \"special effects\". Wedge is +6 points cost, for +2 blue dice against activated squadrons; one of the few efficient cost-to-bonus effects. Luke is 20 points, and ignores shields; you are close to halfway to just including a CR90b with the Dodonna's Pride title instead. You should do that instead. And defense tokens? How are your elite squadrons going to die? They're probably going to take scattered hits, either from other anti-squadrons who deal damage in packets of 1, 2, or 3 damage, or point defense fire that deals damage in packets of 1, 2 damage. Your brace tokens reduce that damage to, 1, 1, 2 respectively. On an X wing that has 5 HP, you're likely taking 3 or 4 attacks that will kill you and make your braces worthless. Volume of attacks is going to be what kills your ships, not the high value of damage. While it is a consideration, it's not the main rule, it's the exception. Scatter is the actual useful defense token, and only one Rebel Ace has it; it's Tycho Celchu...in an A-Wing. So that's nice. Still only take A-Wings? \n This isn't anything new: it's why the second place Gen Con tournament list brought A-Wings, and only 3 of them. For 300 point Rebel lists, it's likely the optimal squadron loadout. For 38 points, you could splurge and bring one Tycho Celchu...but you'll probably want to wait until the \"Rebel Squadrons Tomorrow\" section for more details! Spoiler alert; it doesn't look good, with what little we know at this time. \n Imperial Squadrons Today (and How to Use Them) \n So, the combos remain very clear. Rhymer, Bombers, Admiral Chiraneu, and Corrupter. Bomb City. Rhymerball. Bombastic. TIE Bombertown. \n Throw in various other Imperial squadrons, and you at least have some additional flexible choices. Also, you have more points leeway to play with, seeing how the cheapest naked Gladiator is 56 points. You're likely to have more trouble if you have 40 leftover points and need to cut 16 points of upgrades just to get another naked Gladiator. In reality, you'll want GSD1/ACM, which is 63 points. \n There's actually an argument for taking a variety of Imperial Squadrons; at least they fit in the \"cheap small-ship\"-sized hole currently existing in the Imperial ship selection. Let's use the \"Four Problems with Squadrons\" as a baseline again. \n \n Imperial Squadrons are cheap and efficient. \n They lack utility, but make up for it in numbers, and Major Rhymer is an incredible amount of utility. \n They lack self-sufficiency, but Major Rhymer makes most squadrons self-sufficient. \n Major Rhymer makes all squadrons equal to or greater than identical ships. \n \n 1) Efficient? TIE Fighters are 8 points, TIE Bombers are 9 points. Efficiency at its maximum. High move, decent damage, and the ability to use tactics to get additional damage with Swarm. The Imperials get all the good toys, it seems. \n 2) Utility? While TIEs may lack utility, you can't fault them for it; they're cheap. The more of them you have in a dogfight, the more their average damage per roll increases; Swarm is useful. 3 TIE Fighters is 24 points. 2 A-Wings is 22 points. Utility through numbers, I guess. \n 3) Self-sufficiency is one problem where Imperials lack. While their squadrons combo without the help of squadron commands (like Soontir Fel + TIE Advanced, Howlrunner + TIE Fighters), their overall strategy needs some squadron command love. A TIE Bomber that gets intercepted needs support, or it needs a well timed Admiral Chiraneu command to disengage (and then attack). This would almost be a problem, because TIE Bombers normally need to get into distance 1 to Bomb! However... \n 4) Imperial Squadrons get this cool \"Major Rhymer\" guy. For 16 points, he lets all your squadrons attack ships at close-medium range with their battery dice. He turns TIE Fighters into lesser ship blue dice, and he lets TIE Bombers attack at medium range with black dice that can crit, exactly like ships! Even normal ships need to be in close range to get that damage, while TIE Bombers and Major Rhymer get you those sweet black dice at Medium range. Combined with a Squadron Command, and your little Rhymerball is throwing bomber-enhanced black dice at medium range. And with 5 hull, TIE Bombers are resilient to the potential waves of anti-squadron fire raining down on them. Again, Imperials get all the coolest toys. \n Oh, if Major Rhymer wasn't strong enough, he increases utility and self-sufficiency for all Imperial Squadrons as well! TIE Fighters against a squadron-less list? At least they can contribute 50% chance at 1 damage at medium range. No longer wasted anti-squadron points, if still inefficient. Self-sufficiency? At least your TIE Fighters (with their long range move) don't need to perform any movements; they can stay parked where they are and shoot at medium range. It's a solution that needs a dedicated answer; Rebel players will need to bring anti-squadron points to combat a Rhymerball. Just shooting at Rhymer with ships won't do the trick before his points inclusion adds up to big damage. \n So what did all the Gen Con Imperials bring? Rhymerballs. Some various TIEs thrown in for support. It fills up a good 30 or 40 point deficit in your Imperial lists. Any unique squadrons you bring along don't need to pull away from ship commands; they're already doing their job with their passive abilities. Imperials and their cool toys...Not to mention that they're optional, since the lists that ended up doing well brought no squadrons. Even for all the utility that Rhymer brings, he's not even necessary to win. \n I'd discuss the other elite Imperial pilots but they probably don't need that much discussion. I've already spent most of this section praising Major Rhymer and his ability to make Imperial Squadrons relevant. Throw in the fact that lots of them have Scatter defense tokens, and you have a much better outlook on the current state of Imperial Squadrons, and potential ones for the future. \n Squadrons Tomorrow \n While everyone is excited about the new squadrons that will be introduced in Wave 2, many of the same things will apply. Rogue is a keyword that at least makes squadrons have the ability to move at shoot, increasing the points cost of a squadron to allow it to always move and fire. This at least makes the squadron(s) supplement your army much better. However, more points towards squadrons is less points towards ships and ship upgrades. Unless some of these elite squadrons are very good ship destroyers, chances are that Rogue won't be worth their points either. \n For Rebel Squadrons, our only full spoiler for the Rogues and Villans squadon pack is Jan Ors, the HWK unique pilot. At 19 points, she is a slower A-Wing, with the ability to hand out braces to other pilots, meaning that she can position herself and protect her A-Wing pilots (since you're not taking any other vanilla squadrons other than A-Wings). Jan's ability will allow her A-Wing escorts to decide whether to attack ships, or contribute to dogfights. While 19 points is a hefty investment, Jan Ors seems like a very strong support pilot for the Rebels. \n For Imperial Squadrons, Boba Fett is a much stronger X-Wing. He has a few things that give him bonuses over normal quadrons. When Boba Fett activates, he deals one damage to a squadron  or ship  he is engaged with. As if having the Rogue keyword wasn't enough, he deals steady reliable damage just by activating. With his battery dice being one blue and one black, he can churn out reliable damage to ships since he also has the Rogue  and Bomber  keyword. His points value is rumored to be high (29!). He'll easily be worth his points cost, especially if you compare him to 2 X-Wings at 26 points. Boba Fett is both a good reason for Rebels to bring anti-squadron points in the future, and a decent investment for the Imperial player, a concentration of points but enough of a \"flagship squadron\" to make him worth his points. Of course, we haven't even mentioned our friend the Major, but we'll get to him in a later section. \n Until we know the stats of the other elite squadrons, it's hard to say if those points will make them self-sufficient. Boba Fett himself makes anti-squadron points valuable to a Rebel player. Bring more A-Wings to the fight to combat him. If the correct ratio of squadron points is 10% of the points, then at 400 points you will want to bring a maximum of 40 points of squadrons. Boba Fett + Major Rhymer + TIE Bombers will likely be the superstar of filling Imperial Lists. For Rebels, an extra A-Wing will just strengthen your abilities, and round your squadron points off at 44 points. If you feel luxurious, you could add Jan Ors on top of that, bringing your squadron total to 63 points. An additional 5 points will let you swap out a vanilla A-Wing for Tycho Celchu, which could be useful for jamming and disengaging, but has a special ability which is only relevant when fighting other squadrons. \n Rebel Squadrons Tomorrow \n Barring a strong YT-1300, YT-2400, or Scavenger elite pilot, or other squadron-focused upgrades, it's unlikely that these squadrons will solve the problem of improving Rebel Squadrons. A-Wings themselves already pale in comparison to Boba Rhymer's Flying Circus. The fact that they are cheap, fast, and halfway-efficient makes them the automatic include. Jan Ors also \"increases\" their damage, by helping them deal more Counter-attacks. \n If Rebels didn't have enough issues with their squadrons, they now have an Imperial Raider to deal with! A nimble Imperial ship that rolls either one blue and one black, or two black dice in anti-squadron combat, it will easily brawl and destroy even the most elite of Rebel Squadrons. Best result? Shoot it down with your ships and move your A-Wings away, and have them harass and plink other ships. The value of elite squadrons plummets with the release of the Imperial Raider, and the release of Boba Fett. The dark horse of this argument will be whether the Imperial player wants to even commit the points for an Imperial Raider, which focuses on attacking squadrons. It remains to be seen whether the Raider will fare well against Rebel ships, and not just something to negate their squadrons. \n Rebel Squadrons could use a good boost in positioning improvements, with an upgrade that allows squadrons in Range 1 of the upgraded ship to attack at close-medium range similar to Rhymer, or a far-fetched upgrade that gives all unique squadrons within range 1 Rogue if they activate. Both of these fictional upgrades fix the positioning problem that Rebel squadrons so commonly have, and don't fix the main problem of carrier ship play, which is \"kill the carrier ship\". However, fixing squadron positioning issues allows them to continue to do damage, something that Rebel squadrons have problems doing, which is a problem Imperial Squadrons don't suffer from. Another solution is to give Rhymer to the Rebels, as an upcoming Elite Rebel Squadron Pilot. \n Imperial Squadrons Tomorrow \n Boba Fett and Rhymer, along with Bomber support, create an incredible amount of synergy. Long range and reliable damage are incredibly strong. Rhymer changes the entire squadron game for Imperials, allowing even TIE Fighters to contribute plinking damage from medium range. Giving that benefit to Boba makes both of them very reliable, and very dangerous threats. Even the two of them together is only 45 points (29? + 16), just outside of the 10% optimal points commitment for squadrons. Commiting additional 9 point TIE Bombers to the flying circus is reliable damage. Something something Imperials get the best toys. \n Without a dedicated anti-squadron ship, Boba might need to be careful of the scattering of anti-squadron dice across the Rebel fleet. While he has low speed, he'll likely spend a decent chunk of his time duelling with A-Wings after his incredible threat to ships cause your opponent to donate squadrons to his incredible reliable damage ability. While most people bring additional TIE Bombers to the fight, Boba almost does their job on his own. Considering cheaper TIE Fighters to swarm jamming A-Wings is good, especially because even TIE Fighters will contribute a 50% damage chance on blue dice, at medium range. \n Imperial Squadrons already are a step up from Rebel ones, with the sole inclusion of Major Rhymer increasing the flexibility of all squadrons. His inclusion in a list makes consideration of other squadrons worth it; any of the Elite Imperial pilots in Wave 2 already will benefit greatly from Rhymer, as seen with Boba Fett. \n Summary \n While Imperials already have an interesting reason to include squadrons with Major Rhymer, Rebel pilots currently have no such luxury. Drastic improvements could still be waiting in the...Wings...for Rebel Wave 2. \n \n An update to the tournament rules might give squadrons more time to influence the outcome of the game. \n Unreleased Rebel ships/upgrades/squadrons might give Rebel squadrons a similar effect to Major Rhymer. \n \n Addendum: Squadrons as \"Deployment Advantage Bid\" \n Here's another consideration for including Squadrons, despite how sub-par they may be in their current iteration. You can use them as a \"Deployment Advantage Bid\". While lots of people have knocked \"Superior Positions,\" the blue objective that forces the player with initiative to deploy first, because it doesn't change how your opponent will deploy their forces or how you will deploy yours, there are some unconsidered and future problems that may be solved at deployment time. One example would be Demolisher being counter-deployed by a Rhymer-ball, A-Wing cloud, or other potential future elite Rebel fighters. \n Bidding for \"Deployment Advantage\" by bringing squadrons can be very useful for counter-deploying against ship-only lists. Rebels can spend 22 or 44 points on A-Wings to gain one or two additional deployments (and this is basically the number of fighters you'd like to use). Imperials can spend 27 points for Rhymer and a Bomber for one \"Deployment Advantage\" bid. TIE Fighters can be spent for 16 points for one \"Deployment Advantage,\" although the Imperials' easier-to-utilize tools mean that it might be worth bringing some of their more elite squadrons.": "StarWarsArmada"

            "It was a great week for my  Vampire  campaign. The party was summoned to meet the Prince, who basically chewed them out for not doing the job he gave them and made a bunch of death threats he didn't bother veiling, thinly or otherwise. With a newfound fire under their asses, the PCs headed back to the abandoned tenement in Harlem that marked the scene of the murder they were supposed to be investigating. The mood was appropriately tense, since last time they'd been here, a werewolf literally tore Max's (Gangrel) guts out. \n This time, a dirty-looking bum hanging out on the front steps turned out to be a werewolf, and apparently a lookout as well, barking a warning to his friends inside before tearing off down the street. Vince (Mekhet) was off after him like a flash, burning some Vitae to become a blur of speed, but even his Celerity wasn't enough to catch the lookout after he shifted to full wolf form (and rolled very, very well). \n By the time the others had reached the cellar, two more werewolves were climbing out the windows, with the beefy sonofabitch who had torn Max's intestines out staying behind to cover their escape. After a tense standoff, the party figured out that he didn't necessarily want to fight. The werewolf told them to follow him, pointing to a column of spiders marching across the cellar floor and into a crack in the wall. \n They found the spiders where the column reemerged on the 2nd floor, and followed the bugs up another flight of stairs and up to a closed door. Their lupine companion didn't say a word, just shifted to  Gauru  and tore the door right off its hinges. \n Inside was... a woman, lying on the floor screaming, crying for help, her whole body covered in spiders. The bugs began to scatter, revealing more of her shivering form, and the werewolf strode forward without hesitation, swinging back a clawed hand that would certainly tear the woman in half. \n Vince couldn't stand by and watch another cold-blooded murder, so his Celerity came in handy once again, as he shot in and out of the room in the blink of an eye, escaping with the crying woman over his shoulder. \n Robbie (Nosferatu) met him on the stairs and offered to take her so Vince could pull the car around faster. Already weakening under his burden, Vince thanked him gladly, dumped the woman into Robbie's arms, and shot down the stairs and out the door. At which point Robbie walked her right back up the stairs and tossed her to the werewolf. \n Vince's player was appalled and incensed, but when the Uratha bit down on the woman's neck, her body dissolved into thousands and thousands of tiny spiders. They scattered, heading for the door, and the group was off again, following them down to the basement. \n At the bottom of the steps, they found the spiders forming once again into a single body. But no sooner had the woman's face emerged than something  else  lurched into her from the side, impaling her on a chitinous foreleg. \n It had the torso and face of a man, or something close to one: its eyes were all black, and its mouth held an impossible number of pointed teeth, but it was largely human-looking. Below the waist, though, it was a massive spider, its exoskeleton shiny and wet-looking. Paying no notice to the vampires on the staircase, it started to feed on the other spider-thing. \n Max reached into Owen's (Daeva) belt and snapped up his pistol, leveling it with the beast's center of mass, and did his best to empty the clip. \n A round flew wide; the creature's head snapped up, leveling with its attackers. Another round missed; it began to lumber towards him. Another round; it was closing distance fast. The first round hit home when the thing was only an arm's length away; Owen vaulted over Max's shoulders and rolled past the creature to flank it. The next bullet found purchase, too - but so did the monster's arm, a hard chitinous column that ended in a fierce point. It ran right through Max, leaving a good foot of claw sticking right through his spine and out his back. \n From behind, Owen slammed his fist into the thing, aiming for the orifice on its abdomen that weakly dripped viscous webbing. He ended up elbow-deep inside it; he grabbed ahold of something, and tore his arm back, and the creature screamed, and suddenly it burst, just like the other had, into thousands and thousands of spiders. The things littered the ground and poured fourth from the gaping hole in Max's belly. \n Meanwhile , one player is split from the party: a Lancea Sanctum acolyte assigned to keep an eye on the new fish (the rest of the PCs). Lucius (Ventrue) visited the Bishop this week to find out what the Lancea knew about werewolves and loci and spiders, and was given a new charge by the covenant leader: ingratiate himself with the Circle of the Crone or the Ordo Dracul, and do everything he can to steal information and bring them down. Obviously neither would trust an avowed member of the Lancea, so the Bishop has conveniently framed Lucius for murder and publicly called for him to be brought to justice. None of the PCs know this yet, but you can bet word travels fast among the Covenants... \n And... that's where we left it. The PCs have half a mind to burn the house down. They're not sure at all that they killed the thing for good - or that it's even the last one.": "rpg",
            "I always see posts asking what games and systems are good for introducing inexperienced players and GMs to the hobby. I've been Call of Cthulhu for my group - first RPG I've ever run, first RPG of any kind for most of them - for about a year now. We're smack-dab in the middle of a campaign at the moment (Masks of Nyarlathotep, if you must know), and it's going swimmingly, but after this one I'd like to take a bit of a break from Cthulhu before system fatigue sets in. To that end, I need a new game to get ready before the end of this one, and I figured I'd open it up to /rpg. \n Now, I'll be asking my players what THEY wanna play, obviously, but I don't think any of them have even really heard of anything but Cthulhu and D&D. They like the investigative part of this game, but what they really seem to get a kick out of is character development and roleplaying. So I'll definitely be leaning more towards story elements than combat elements. Beyond that, I don't have much preference; basically, what do you think would be a good game to expand their horizons? What are some of your favorite systems? What are their pros and cons? \n Systems that sort of intrigue me are New World of Darkness (for character-driven story), Deadlands (for awesome flavor and cool mechanics), Mutants & Masterminds (for setting and flexibility), Paranoia & Toon (both for uniqueness and pure wacky factor).

            "There's no doubt that different systems are better suited to different stories, and provide different experiences. If you want to get together with friends on weekends and have yourself a dungeon crawl, and AD&D1 is doing that in a way that you're satisfied with, there's nothing wrong with sticking with it. On the other hand... \n \n If you want to dungeon-crawling with no turn order and slightly more narrative-facing rules, try  Dungeon World . It's great and free, and the ten minutes you'd spend perusing the rulebook may really pique your interest. \n \n If you want to push further in that narrative direction, give  FATE Core  a look. The characters' traits cause problems for them, but also enable them to do more awesome stuff. Ultimately, when played well, this means you create a story that really, really feels like it was created for and by those specific characters, with satisfying dramatic arcs and everything. \n \n If you want to play some non-Cthulhu horror stuff, you could always give  Dread  a try. A Jenga tower for task resolution (instead of dice) means things get more tense and difficult (and closer to death) as the game goes on, which makes it really easy for the GM to pace a good horror yarn. \n \n If you want to really blow your hair back, pick up  Fiasco . No GM, no skill checks, no character sheets... it won't even look like an RPG to you at first. But it's a blast every time. More than any other on this list, I  beg  you - try Fiasco.

            "OK, so the latest in a series of short adventures (1-6 sessions) to test out different systems sees me running a Traveller campaign for my group. Should we decide this is the game we like best, and return to it for a longer campaign, my vague campaign plans revolve around the PCs jetsetting around Darrian subsector, trying to prevent ancient plans for a working doomsday weapon from falling into enemy (or any) hands. \n For now, though, the PCs are just strangers in a strange land, mostly outcasts of one stripe or another. They took a job from the mysterious Artur Dehlyr, who promised to pay them handsomely just to run one of his ships, loaded with innocuous cargo, from one system to another. \n So, pirates ambush and easily cripple the PCs' ship just inside the destination system. The party fights valiantly and wounds or kills every member of the boarding party, only to have the captain still aboard the enemy ship threaten to utterly destroy them with superior firepower unless they jettison cargo. They jettison cargo. The pirate captain, who identifies himself as one Ace Simcoe, escapes, leaving his heavily-injured cronies behind in the PCs' hands. Being PCs, they immediately do some aggressive interrogation, which leaves one prisoner dead and gets a few whimpers from another about \"those missiles you were carrying.\" Up until this point, they've heard nothing about any missiles. \n Once on-world, the PCs head to the shady black market area, rub elbows with a few criminal scumbag types, and manage to score an (expensive) invitation to play in a card game where Simcoe is a regular fixture. \n Satisfied with this opportunity for the future, they head to Artur Dehlyr's complex to meet the guy and give him the bad news. \n Dehlyr basically tells the PCs they're about 34 million credits in debt to him - 30 for the unenriched uranium cargo they were being paid to transport (they don't say anything about the missiles), 4 for ship repairs - and they're gonna have to go recover that stolen cargo if they like remaining intact. To make sure they don't try to flee, he fuses a tracking device to the spine of the party leader (OK, maybe he's just the loudest and rudest in the bunch). \n The PCs go to their card game, meet Ace Simcoe in person - and realize they've seen the same guy before, walking out of Dehlyr's office earlier that day. He tells them he's got a pretty hot piece of cargo he's showing to some prospective buyers the next day - would-be terrorists from the nearby Sword Worlds - and he could use some extra security, as his latest targets all but gutted his old crew. \n Of course the PCs sign on gladly. The next day they head to the meet, at the pirates' warehouse several hours' worth of driving into the desert. Simcoe meets them at the door and beckons them inside... where they find Dehlyr and a dozen of his toughest men, armed to the teeth. \n \n See, the cargo in question is, in fact, an advanced nuclear bombardment system. Dehlyr knows smuggling it onto this world would be tough - but he also knows the local authorities have an \"arrangement\" with several groups of pirates: a certain amount of raiding and piracy is ignored, provided they don't raid on-world settlements, and provided certain officials get their cut. So with extremely sensitive or illegal cargoes - like this one - he pays Simcoe, or other captains like him, to \"steal\" one of his cargoes en route to the spaceport, bypassing customs altogether. The PCs just happen to be the unfortunates hired for the \"legitimate\" part of the shipping job. Dismayed that they survived the encounter and by their unexpected combat prowess - and all the questions they immediately started asking - Dehlyr put them on Simcoe's trail to control them and manipulate them into this moment, where he has them entirely at his disposal. So, the question is... what does he do now? \n The smartest and safest move on Dehlyr's part would probably be having the PCs shot to death right now, on the floor of the warehouse, before they have a chance to escape their bonds. But that would hardly be an interesting plot turn. \n So, the question becomes: how can I get them out of there alive? A few stray thoughts: \n \n The most important thing to Dehlyr, as a well-established businessman who stands to make a lot of money here, is that his deal with the Sword Worlders goes down and  stays secret . If he can be convinced that killing the party wouldn't protect his investment as soundly as some other course of action, he has no particular predilection toward the violent path - he's just interested in the most efficient one. \n \n At least one PC is worth more alive than dead: Damien Wist, the same loudmouth who now has Dehlyr's tracker fused to his spine, is a disgraced noble whose head will fetch 50,000 credits on his homeworld (his whole, unhurt body considerably more), where he is accused of fomenting discord and revolution among the underclasses. Simcoe and Dehlyr both know this, though 50k is certainly more significant to Simcoe than it is to Dehlyr. A bounty hunter previously encountered by the party has already made an offer to Simcoe for Wist. \n \n There is considerable mining industry on this world, as well as some limited agriculture, and since we're outside the borders of both the Third Imperium and the Darrian Confederation, it's likely unscrupulous employers could get away with, shall we say, unpaid compulsory employment. I haven't established very clearly what Dehlyr  primarily  does (besides shipping and arms dealing), so it's possible he owns one of the planet's many mines, or that he knows scummy mining moguls who would pay top dollar for able-bodied workers. \n \n It's possible that, with the PCs bound and secured, Dehlyr might move out with his men, choosing to let Simcoe do the dirty work while his and his security team's hands remain clean of all possible connection to the murders. Simcoe, meanwhile, has his own motivations and isn't beholden to Dehlyr, so he may find some other use for the PCs if he thinks he can get away with it. That they slaughtered his previous crew handily means he's in need of some new blood and he knows these guys can be effective fighters - and ruthless ones.": "rpg",
            "Ugh. Because geeks and Internet people (and I'm saying this as both) love having shit to argue over and judge each other about. \n Seriously, though, a lot of newer, younger players have been introduced to the hobby by 4E, which was designed to balance out the classes, give everyone \"cool moves,\" make combat even more a central focus of the game... basically, to give something closer to the MMO experience at the tabletop. It makes sense, because there's plenty of kids out there who love World of Warcraft but have never rolled a d20, and why wouldn't you want to tap into that market? \n Still, gamers who came up on 3.5, and especially the old-timers who love AD&D 1 or 2 best of all, hate 4E with a passion, because they feel it strips away all of the things they love about the game. In balancing out the classes, WotC took away much of the customization that traditional powergamers love. In focusing so heavily on combat, they made miniatures a completely necessary part of the game and gave far less detail/opportunity for roleplay, exploration, puzzles, etc. \n As I've said 'round these parts before, I don't get the feud. Nobody burned all the copies of 3.5 or AD&D, and if 4E is basically an elaborate fantasy combat boardgame, let the college kids play their boardgame. Nobody's forcing anything on anyone, so I don't see why anybody would get mad about what Wizards is currently releasing, so long as the system they love still exists somewhere.": "rpg",
            "Okay, /r/rpg, I've painted myself into a corner, as they say. I started running Call of Cthulhu about a year ago, for maybe three of my friends at first, which isn't enough for a game so deadly/dependent on individual Spot Hidden rolls. So I kept, y'know, casually mentioning it to various friends, hoping to pull in two or three more players to round out the group. It worked, but also my players have been telling people about the game, and I have a chronic problem with saying no AND have never run a game before, until last week I looked around the table and realized we had eight players plus me. \n Obviously this can't keep going this way, but how do I handle it? It would feel shitty to toss willing players out into the cold, and most of these people are among my close friends, so it'll be tough to single anyone out without hurting some feelings. But eight REALLY IS too many, and worse, I feel like some are just around because they like the company, rather than the game - which is flattering but disruptive. One girl literally won't speak for an entire session, but just desperately wants to get out of her house and likes hanging out with us. She bakes us brownies every week; how can you turn such a sweet person away from your table?! \n I've toyed with the idea of splitting the group; we can all still meet at my house, but someone else will have to GM a separate game at another table. This could have advantages - if we start playing a game at Table 1 that player X doesn't like, he could head over to Table 2 next week and see what GM (b) is running. But I see how that could devolve into chaos. \n I know I did this to myself, ultimately. I'd like to just stick out this campaign before we make any drastic/potentially sticky changes, but it's going to be a LONG haul, and all the distractions a big group brings will just make it longer. \n Anyone else ever find themselves GMing a weekly group that got way too big? What's the most graceful way to handle it? We have fun every single week, I just feel like the game could be better; last week half the group couldn't make it, and the one-off we ran went way smoother than the main game's been going.": "rpg",

Check the bird, if skin has reached golden brown colour, take a piece of tinfoil and cover the top of the bird to prevent the skin from getting too dark.

I've been sending people stuff/ exchanging stuff for years and I'm well aware of the costs involved and explaining to whoever is sending me stuff about UK import tax thresholds. \n Tiered swop would help keep cost down for those who don't want to do a massive exchange (I myself usually go for the lowest option on reddit swaps which has so far been around \u00a316). So it could be a swop of one lipstick, or two eyeshadow singles for example- at drug store or indie prices the initial cost would be ~\u00a35. For those who want more items/ more expensive items there can be higher tiers. Maybe add at the bottom (like a lot of online shops that ship internationally) that receivers should check thier local import customs thresholds to help them decide on a tier and inform thier swop partners. \n I think another factor that pushes up the cost and weight is the unspoken keeping up with the jonses obligation for sending extras (like sweets) in the makeup subs on reddit. Doing a 'pure' swop would illuminate that. \n What I really enjoy about exchanges is interacting with people over a common interest- finding out about someone and trying to figure out what they would enjoy from what they've told me, or what thing they might never have bought for themselves but I think would work well. And the same for me I get things I've never considered but actually turn out really well, or things I've coveted from afar. \n Ultimately I could just buy these things myself, and whilst shopping for myself is fun and all its not the same. \n /r/MUAEurope recently started up and now has a spreadsheet with various brands based in various European countries which just makes me thirst for an exchange because there are so many gems that never get a platform in the US centric main beauty subs.

I digress, this probably feeds more into how to help the sub be active or something. \n An exchange with other brown beauties (which I am admittedly on the paler spectrum right now with winter skin) would mean interacting with people who get what it's like to spend years (it's taken me 18 years of trying off and on again to find a foundation (well BB cream) that's close enough to my actual colour for me to be happy with and even now it's not yellow enough) and money (\u00a329 for 40ml).

We do our little tour and find a pretty significant crack in the wall. Pretty obvious that there's a potential foundation issue. We're doing an FHA loan, so that won't fly. Our realtor informs us that the owner of the house is also a realtor! So he knows that he's going to have to fix the foundation in order for us to not only qualify for FHA, but also to have any interest in the house at all. We decide that we really like the house, and since the owner/realtor seems to be fully aware that he may have to fix the foundation in order for us to buy it, we move forward. Two inspections later, we confirmed that there is a pretty serious foundation issue. We also confirmed that he failed to disclose several issues. Long story short, the seller tried everything to avoid dealing with the foundation issue. When our realtor reminded him that the FHA inspector was going to notice the crack and wouldn't approve the loan anyway, the seller suggested that we \"paint over the crack\" in an effort to dupe the FHA inspector into approving what has turned out to be a disaster of a house. \nSome other sneaky things he did: \nDidn't disclose a slab leak from last year \nDidn't disclose 2 previous termite treatments \nTold us there was a full-price cash offer on the house after it had been under contract with us for 2 weeks.

And nothing has changed in the past 2 months. \nSo I figured, maybe he's not controlling the situation with our other dog (a 3 year old pit-mix) and maybe little Precious doesn't feel safe enough to eat.

And Opal (dog) walks through the living room, also relaxed and chill. This should never turn into an issue right? Well as soon as Opal passes by that chair, Ozzie reaches out and claws the skin on her back, pulls it up, and then bites it! It looked like he was biting into a hamburger! Just totally out of the blue. They do this stuff all. the. time. \nI've never really seen it as too much of an issue, just weird horseplay. Opal didn't seem to mind too much but recently, she's been very concerned if the cats approach her. Sometimes she'll even growl at them. (this is very recent- the cats started it!) Now if opal was a little shihtzu or something I wouldn't been too worried because it would be an even match. But she's a 60 lb pit mix and if she decides to defend herself against their attacks, she could do some serious damage. So how do I get my cats to stop being terrorists?": "Pets",

We got the okay from the shelter to introduce him to our dogs last Sunday, and that helped a little bit, but they're pretty bored with  being chewed now. I can't blame them. It's gotten almost vicious. Like I was \"playing\" with him this evening and I spent more time saying OUCH (and a few other choice words) and walking away than I did playing with him. And that little sucker is biting HARD. I mean I've worked with bobcat kittens that didn't bite this hard. I'm exhausted. I'm hoping this is my last week with him.

            "Pitbulls aren't the problems, irresponsible owners are. I know I will be biased in this, because I own two of them. However, I also read a lot and like to know what I have at the other end of the leash, so I hope I can contribute somewhat at least. Although you seem like you need a professional to actually change your mind, I'll try and provide some info and insight. \n During the beginning of the 1900's the Pitbull was really americas sweetheart. It was used in  ads . \n In the 70's and 80's dog fighting gained popularity in USA, and the go-to breed was the pitbull. This started to give the pitbulla bit of a bad rap, and it became the go to breed for anyone who wanted a dog who looked bad ass. Bad owners --> bad dogs. A pretty huge catalyst in all this was the media. When the news started to describe the pitbull as viscious it became a must-have for criminals. This started a viscious circle. \n One example of how hevily biased mass media is against pitbulls now (these examples are from 2007): [A 70 year old man who was hospitalized critically injured by a lab who also attacked the police when they arrived was only reported in one local newspaper. A 69 year old woman being attacked by two pitbulls were reported in 230 articles, national and international, including MSNBC and FOX.]( \n Most of this is from [The Pitbull Placebo]( but some from other articles and websites.": "changemyview",
            "My dog loves people. He loves them so, so much. \n He's an intact pitbull male. He's very exitable in general but he's gets plenty of exercise, both physical and mental. He's 16 months old now, and we've come a long way. Every time we get visitors is a training session. If he had his way, he'd bark like mad at the door, jump on our guests, cover their faces with slobbery loving kisses and run around their feet like mad while they came into the house. \n We've managed this by having him on a leash when guests come over and reward him with treats for basically any behavior that is not listed above. He gets to greet the guests once he's calm. When we started it could take up to an hour of him crying and making a fuzz, but now he only wears the leash for a minute or so before he's gotten over most of his exitement, so I can unleash him and he'll still listen to me. However, if I allow him to greet the guests for more than half a second, he start licking his nose/their clothes/hands/faces/legs like crazy. It doesn't matter how long I wait for. Sometimes he's not allowed to greet the guests at all for this reason, people just don't think it's nice. He immediatly stops when I call him to me but it would be nice to have him interact with people in a less annoying way. Any advice would be much appreciated.": "Dogtraining",

She had the dog for two years before she had to put her down due to cancer, and in that time she made it to advanced obedience class. \n Look into clicker training, it's in my experience (and according to science) the fastest way to teach dogs new things.

It was dark outside and he was huge. He just threw himself at Lady saying/shouting \"werrrl hello doggie\". Lady jumped back away from him, tail between legs, ears back, and growled. And he of course... Went after her. I let go of the leash and stepped in between. \"You do not need to pet this dog. She does not want to be petted.\" to which he replied \"Of course she does, all dogs love me\". \n I replied something about him being drunk, loud, scary and if I didn't want to be near him my dog shouldn't have to tolerate it either. As I walked away he yelles after me all the things I did wrong and how I should've slapped the dog when she growled and that I'm only letting her dominate and what not. \n Ok, so drunks at the bus station are obviously a little different from people at the dog park, so this was an extreme example.

I have a amstaff/rottie mix, I can't really do much when a cat comes up to us with the intent of clawing her in the face. Last time that happened though, my dog didn't seem to understand that the cat was angry and went into a bowing play position and tried to play with it, while the cat was literallyholding on to her face with its claws.

Favorite activity! \n Given that Casper is only five months old and Lady is 2,5 years, Lady is indeed the more dominant one. However I think the term \"alpha\" isn't the correct term to use in this case. \n Claiming that one idividual is alpha, and the next one in the hierarchy is beta, is insinuating that there was an alpha battle. That kind of battle takes place when pack animals compete about the right to mate, food, or other limited resources. There's really no reason for these two to have such a fight, since they don't need to compete about resources. Wolves don't have alpha individuals either (although biologists thought so through most of the 1900's), but a \"reproducing couple\" which are parents to the other pack members. They don't fight (in the wild at least) because that would potentially compromise the survival of the entire pack (injured wolves can't hunt).": "dogpictures"

            "Hi! You guys have been so helpful in these past few months, I've adopted my first dog as an adult, and she's definitely a project. (Abused Mali, so sweet but has come with quite a few obstacles.) \n I have a few questions: \n \n She's 1 year old and has  suddenly un-housebroken herself . She's having accidents indoors almost every day and is not going on schedule (almost seems like she wants to go inside). It isn't cold outside, but my school schedule did change and I'm gone 2 days a week (live with my SO who takes good care of her those days). I'm thinking it's stress of me not being there, but is there anything I can do? She's even doing it when I'm home, and sometimes even in the same room as me. I know that at a year she should be able to hold it, and it's not a bladder problem (my initial concern) as she's doing both indoors. \n \n Crating didn't use to be an issue for her at all, but I think my schedule change (see above) has shaken her up a little, and now  when I crate her she is trying ANYTHING to escape it . After a few successful break-outs (so now she KNOWS she can get out), I bought a stronger crate (never had a problem with crating her before, really, so I didn't need a strong one) and she rubbed the skin off her nose trying to push out of it. :/ I feel awful, but if I leave her out she goes in the house. My trainer said \"If she's acting like a puppy, treat her like a puppy\" and reinstate crating, but she stresses quite a bit I think and I want to minimize that as she's already had a difficult life in her first 10 months. \n \n As a note: She is a rescue and was abused in the past. She does not show signs of recent abuse and  I am confident in the care she gets when I am not there ; my SO also has a dog and he takes wonderful care of the two of them.  \n She is a Malinois and is super laser-focused... on squirrels outside. Is there  anything I can do to try to get her to listen to me outdoors ? We have loose-leash walking about 80% down, SO MUCH PROGRESS since I brought her home 3 months ago, but I see dogs at the park listening to their owners doing sit/down/stay and while she comes in my general direction when I ask for a recall, she is too spazzy to do commands. Even on-leash outside is a challenge, so any tips for working on that would be great because our ultimate goal for 2015 is CGC.  \n \n Thanks so much for any insight! This sub is awesome.": "Dogtraining",
            "Hi, /r/puppy101, I have a 15 month old Malinois rescue named Kaia. She's a sweet dog, and at some point in her life (prior to being found by the rescue at 9 months old) she was abused pretty badly. \n In all areas of training she is greatly improving, and we are on our way to CGC. We still have chewing accidents sometimes, and her curiosity can get the best of her but I love her for it (even if my hair dryer cords don't).  However, about 2 months ago, she has un-potty-trained herself. \n She is crate trained, but I absolutely hate for her to have to sit in a crate all day while I'm at work. My boyfriend's 11 y/o dog has free reign of the house, and I'd like mine to be able to walk around and play too, it's not fair. \n \n The Problem:  This is behavioral, not medical (I've taken her to the vet and she's gotten a clean bill of health). She can't go more than 2 or 3 days without messing in the house, and I will undoubtedly have one or the other to clean up at least two times a week, sometimes much more frequently. She was perfectly potty trained before and her schedule hasn't changed too much, she should be able to hold it. \n Sometimes we'll have really good days where she does all her business when I take her out in the AM, and I leave her out of the crate and she does fine. Other days, she won't go in the AM (is distracted by squirrels, or just generally stubborn about it) and I'll leave her out and shower, only to find that not 5 minutes after coming in, there is a mess on the floor. I have a work schedule, so I usually give her 2 chances in the morning to go out before I have to crate her if the first time was not successful. I always praise potty outside. \n If I lock her out of the bedroom to have some alone time with the boyfriend, she will pee on the carpet. She'll not go potty in the morning and then poo in the living room 5 minutes after we get in. Sometimes she'll go in the house just an hour or two after she successfully went out. \n She has destroyed our apartment's carpet, I'm going to have to pay $1500 in security deposit when we move out and I'm just so tired of cleaning up messes. I had to buy a carpet shampooer and it's just been an added expense.  I'm a student, I don't have this kind of cash, and I'm really worried about the security deposit etc. I'm going to have to pay. I understand that dogs have expenses, but this seems so unnecessary, this is why I adopted an adult dog! \n I'm really diligent about taking her out, she's 15 months old (basically an adult, certainly not a puppy) and she's able to hold it longer than she has been doing.

We can walk right on by. \n Our only problem is when our GSD, Sirius, gets confronted by what I call a \"rude dog\" (aka a dog that is off leash or is unresponsive to owner's commands). There's always that asshole person who has a dog on a flexi leash, letting it get in my GSD's face or people don't even have their dog on the leash and my GSD feels the need to control the situation by loudly barking and lunging, not with teeth more with his body just to get the intruder away from our pack.

            "Annabelle  - I grew up with dogs and finally had income, a pet friendly rental and only one year of school left - I could finally get a dog. I was checking out various breeders, but ultimately decided I wanted to support the SPCA. And I was looking at $600 to a breeder, or $150 to an SPCA for an already spayed, health checked, vaccinated dog. We went to visit one Sunday afternoon to check out a small black dog on the website (we had a 18\" height restriction at the rental) - and said dog was being adopted as we walked in. The person working at the front told us we HAD to meet this dog that loved people. She had been at the shelter for a month and was returned once already. If you put your hands through the chain link mesh of her cage, she ran up and down your hands because she loved the attention so much. We took her outside and played ball with her, and fell in love with her personality. The shelter was closing and couldn't process her application or hold her, so we both took the afternoon off the following adoption day, and adopted her as they opened at 2pm. I'll never forget an older lady who told us \"God bless you for adopting her\" as we were leaving the shelter. Anna was not house trained, AT ALL. And she threw up every time she rode in a car. We worked on these things for quite a long time, and now she's the best, snuggly dog you could have.  Photo of Annabelle  when we adopted her:  and Annabelle today: \n Zane  - This summer I started thinking about getting a 2nd dog, \"someday\", as my agility/flyball/rally dog and Anna's companion. We were fostering for a rescue and looking to get our first foster dog when I met Zane at an adoption event. I got handed him to foster starting that day, and figured I'd hang around at the event to see if anyone was interested in him before going home. Sure enough, a family met him and wanted to apply, so the current foster just kept him. We eventually fostered a wonderful little guy named Scooter, and then a border collie named Star. We found out we really do love the border collie breed, but Star wasn't the right dog for us long term - and I kept telling my boyfriend about Zane. \n Zane was returned after a week with the applicant. Some time later I asked about his status - but he had a new pending adoption on him. So we applied for a puppy with a different rescue instead. A couple of weeks later I got a message - Zane's 2nd completed adoption had fallen through again, he was returned because he was \"too ball obsessed\" and tended to hide in the corner. His foster needed a babysitter for the weekend for him anyway, so we traded Star with another foster to have Zane for the weekend. Needless to say he's never left. He is a timid little guy at times (I later learned at an agility seminar from people involved in saving him that he was abused by a farmer) but he's working through that, and his drive for working is incredible. He's a very fun dog.  Photos of Zane : \n Edit: haha that turned out long.": "dogs",
            "No I don't. I first met him when he was 9 months old and adopted him at 11 months old. He was a rescue dog, taken in by a nice lady who runs a kennel, and moved into New Hope Dog Rescue for help with finding him an appropriate home (he is very high energy). I met him at a fundraising event I was volunteering at, and had planned to foster him starting that day but a family met him and wanted to adopt him (they didn't) so he stayed with his current foster. When I realized he hadn't gone out, and that he was what I wanted I inquired again, but he had another application - that fell through again. The applicants didn't like his ball drive - wha! He's a border collie! Anyway, at this point he had been in five different homes while in rescue due to adoptions falling through, that's when we took him for the weekend to see if he liked our hound. We adopted him 2 days later, he's amazing. \n I don't know his breeding background at all but one of the people involved in rescuing him believes he's at least 3/4 if not full border collie. The same person also cleared up for me why he can be terrified of new people - as a puppy he was abused by a farmer who believed the way you train dogs not to run away is to tie them up and hit them. When the kennel that rescued him saved him, they reported the owner. We do a lot of socializing trying to help him work through his fear of new people... \n Do you have photos of your puppy? Zane is short hair, only about 35lbs and very athletic - he's perfect! I had originally been looking for a \"typical\" long hair border collie, but I am totally sold on the sleek coats now. The short hairs are definitely my favorite!!": "BorderCollie",
            "With her, it's the literal truth. The story goes like this: She was picked up at large and the owner was contacted. The owner wasn't interested in paying the pound and running at large fees required to reclaim her so she became SPCA property. At this point the SPCA does an assessment to decide if they can adopt the dog out, and if they fail the behavior assessment at any point, they are deemed unadoptable and euthanized. Standard practice. Star is a resource guarder towards other dogs, mostly due to insecurity. Something like that is very trainable, but the SPCA staff doesn't have time with shelter dogs. Supposedly she might have been originally adopted out through the rescue I foster for in the very early days, so the SPCA contacted my rescue before euthanizing her. \n The intake coordinator who picked her up sent me this after we had her safely at my house (we fostered her). \"Did I tell you that I was late by 15 minutes and she was next up, she was tied to the pole for euthanization...Such a close call and what a waste of a gorgeous dog.\" She said had she not showed up when she did, she wouldn't have been picking the dog up. The SPCA is busy, they don't have time for no shows. \n We worked for a month and a half on Star's resource guarding and learned what we found out is typical of some older adult female border collies - they're not dog-dogs. They LOVE people, but they don't have any patience for annoying young dogs. They're a working breed through and through. Then we got the perfect application for her, single dog home, no children, experienced with herding breeds, willing to work on her confidence and now she's a wonderful success story. \n Shelters don't just tell us this, it's a reality. If I remember correctly, our shelter euthanizes about half of the incoming animals. If they fail their behavior assessment they are considered unsafe for adoption and are euthanized. Shelter staff don't have time to fix every little problem that dogs get dumped with. Herding breeds don't fare well in shelters. That's why we also need foster home based rescues in addition to shelters. Both play an important role, foster based rescues help good dogs like Star who would otherwise fall through the cracks of a busy, overloaded shelter system. \n PLEASE spay and neuter your pets.": "aww",
            "Friend and I are thinking about getting a competition quality teeter this summer and I have found a supplier and figured everything out short of whether or not to get Agile Grip (a rubberized contact material) on it. The price for Agile Grip on the new teeter is relatively cheap, so the cost is not a concern. Cost aside, what are the pros/cons of going with a rubberized contact? \n From my understanding rubberized is safer. One of my instructors was concerned the dogs trained on rubberized have too much trouble going from rubber to wood and recommended sticking with wood. But we will still have access to wood contacts as my local club does not have rubberized. My priorities would be safety, training effectiveness and cost in that order.": "Dogtraining",
            "This beagle mix dog ended up in rescue:  I'm disappointed I don't have a better image, but anyway, he is wearing a harness because his neck was so badly burned from an anti bark shock collar that he wasn't able to wear a collar. Additionally, at some point he also had an embedded collar that had to be removed. \n He was tied outside 24/7. Lack of any type of exercise, time with a family or training led him to bark excessively, and the owners to decide to \"fix\" the issue by buying an anti bark shock collar. Obviously, it did not work. This, combined with several other issues that were directly due to a lack of training, socialization or caring led the owners to dump this dog at a vet clinic at 3 years old and request he be euthanized. However, once he had been exercised enough, he did not bark while he was in my house and generally just curled and slept.": "dogs"

            "Just copy + pasting my reply from [this]( Barkbox thread: \n God. Yes. I used to be on the fence but now I'm definitely pro-Barkbox. \n To quote myself from my last response to a Barkbox thread: \n >I got the first box in August.. 50lb+ of course. Came with a bag of [these]( a bag of [these]( [this]( food topper, [this]( cool mix, and an orange waterproof shark similar to [this]( \n >Cy LOVED both bags of treats. With a passion. He LOVES the bully flakes (I've been using them sparingly so he doesn't get dependent on them) in his food. I haven't made the cubes or the broth yet but I will, soon. Cy doesn't play with toys so any toy they include is bound to be a dud, so I couldn't be disappointed in it. I really loved the quality of the treats - the liver treats especially, the only ingredient, I believe, was freeze dried turkey liver. I don't remember the duck treats but there was nothing offensive in them either. Cy adored 'em both. \n >I didn't really know that it would be worth doing more than 1 month at a time, and I wasn't going to pay $30 a month for month to month. I canceled my sub. They promptly suckered me back in with a buy-three-get-greatest-hits deal so now I've got more coming. \n >This month we got a green turtle toy for hardcore chewers (Cy is not - toy is again a waste), spray on wound bandage, a box of really interesting treats with the flavor of 'Tuscan Pizza' and yes they smell good enough to eat, a bag of beef jerky biscuits, and a crunchy deer chew that was gone in about 0.2 seconds flat. Obviously well loved by Cy. The other two treats, again a big hit but Cy isn't picky. The wound spray might come in handy someday and I wouldn't have ever thought to buy it myself. The toy, again, meh. \n >I just today got the greatest hits box they offered me when they suckered me back into signing up. They sent two chews, one beef and cheddar and one chicken and cheddar, slim-jim like in texture and the first one I gave him was gone instantly as well.. They sent a firm velvety-ish squeaky toy, hard to describe, but again Cy didn't even look at it so w/e, a bag of treats flavored like coconut, molasses, and flax - they're training treat size and low calorie which is a really nice change from all the big treats. They sent a bag of beef treats which I haven't opened yet, and a bottle of dog beer. Yeah. [DOG BEER.]( I can't wait to see what the boy thinks of that. \n >Cy now basically thinks that any box that comes through the door is his, after three barkboxes and one pawbox (do not recommend pawbox, btw - seriously) he gets excited when I get a box from the mailman. Automatically thinks it's for him. Usually it is, lol. \n >I have really liked the treats they've sent so far. They're all really nice quality treats that have gone over with the dogboy very well. They give you a tracking number when they send the boxes out on the 15th of the month which is extra nice. The toys are a waste for us since Cy doesn't have ANY interest in toys, but.. what can ya do. The wound spray was nice and the mix in the first box was something I'd never seen before. I may actually continue to get the boxes after the third month here. \n >If you want to try it, you can get  $10 off \n I recently sent an email to Barkbox support asking if they'd consider sending a treat ball or puzzle toy of some kind since my dog doesn't really play with toys. I thought that would be the only kind of toy he'd play with. I got a prompt response asking me more about his likes and dislikes. Conclusion: a box arrived, in  addition  to the regularly-scheduled October Barkbox, containing an  IQ ball . At no charge. Just because I politely asked if they'd consider sending something, they went ahead and sent Cy one and sent him a surprise, too. \n The October box arrived same day. In it was a chew like the one above but  rabbit  flavored, a glow in the dark ball, a strange chew/tug/whatever toy, a bag of goat liver treats, and a bag of 8 mini treat bags. Like, Halloween gift bags. \n There is a blog that reviews the barkboxes.. The lady that writes the blog reviews lots of subscription boxes. She gets one small box a month for her two small dogs to share and she actually adds up the monetary value of everything in the box to compare to the price. Most of the months I looked through were worth about $35-40 at retail value for the SMALL dog box. So you definitely get your money's worth.

            "My dog started being on and off lame in one of his hind legs when he was 3 years old. Usually when he first got up from a nap he'd have a little limp in the back. It was enough for me to notice but he always walked out of it and it never seemed to bother him or keep him from running and playing so stupidly, we did not go to the vet for it. Big dog, hard floors. No problem, right? \n And then he was playing in the yard one night, yelped, and was completely non-weight bearing on the left hind. Rushed to the emergency vet, they checked him out and were able to tell immediately when they felt they moved the knee that it was a torn ACL. They can't tell if it's just partial or full tear that easily. They said give it a couple weeks and if no improvement we will talk surgery. \n Two weeks later, no improvement, he had the first TPLO done. CCL was fully torn, and his meniscus was also partially torn. Would not have healed without surgery. \n Two weeks after the first TPLO, he was given the all-clear for short 10-15 minute walks. On his very first walk around the yard the next day, he got excited, bounced, and went non-weight bearing in the right leg. Called his surgeon who was kind enough to see him in between surgeries. He confirmed that the second ACL was blown. Give him a couple weeks to see. So we did. \n Three weeks later he had TPLO #2. CCL was fully torn. Would not have healed without surgery. \n My guy made a 100% recovery and now runs and plays just as well as he did before he was injured. \n There are three different surgeries that I know of for this, but I only know about two. There is the Lateral Suture, otherwise known as the \"fishing line\" surgery. It's the least expensive option but also the least solid option. Greater risk of failure, greater risk of arthritis in a young dog, but it'll do the job. \n The one my dog had, the TPLO, involves actually reshaping the bone and essentially replacing the ACL. It's a very solid, permanent fix with very low risk of failure. There is still a chance for arthritis in a young dog with it (that is unavoidable - doesn't matter which surgery you get) but it's not as high as the lateral suture. The big downside is that it's much more expensive than the lateral suture. Exact cost depends on your area but for the two surgeries  alone , without the emergency vet visit or extra x-rays or other appointments, the total was  OVER $9000!!!  But literally, it was. \n You're going to need to think about this and start looking up surgical options. If your dog's ACL is fully torn or if it does fully tear at any point, not getting surgery is not a viable option if you ever want your dog to enjoy playing again.": "dogs",
            "I'm sorry for this, but I'm going to be brutally honest regardless of what downvotes I may recieve because there are a lot of idiots who are probably watching Game of Thrones and thinking  \"YEAH! I WANT A DIRE WOLF!\"  who will eventually go out and buy some wolf hybrid or super scammy designer breed on appearances alone.. \n Wolfdogs are not pets. They are  NOT  pets. I'm sorry. If you get a wolf hybrid on appearances without reading up on them (which will surely deter you from getting one), you are a  fucking moron . \n Wolfdogs are NOT animals with a dog's personality in a wolf's body. They do NOT behave like dogs. You will not have a pet who can be trusted around your neighbor's cats, or who can be let off-leash in the open without fear of running away. You will not have a pet who can be easily trained and who will do what you want, when you want. You will have a pet who is very likely to be very stand-offish and wary of strangers, skittish, difficult to train with an incredibly high prey drive and instinct to run away. When they bite, they bite HARD. Wolf hybrids are part wild animal and they fucking act like it, whether you want to believe it or not. They are not good house pets AT ALL. \n There is a reason there are so many sanctuaries for wolves and wolf hybrids. People get them and then find out the hard way that they are NOT. FUCKING. DOGS. Very few people can actually handle a hybrid, especially that is medium or high wolf content so encouraging people to keep breeding them by buying them is completely irresponsible and idiotic. Owning a wolfdog doesn't make you look cool, it makes you look like an ignorant twat who got a dog  solely  because of its looks because a wolfdog cannot provide a  single fucking thing  that any breed of domestic dog cannot. \n Also, buying a puppy (wolf hybrid or not) at six weeks makes you look like an exceptionally irresponsible, ignorant potential dog owner.

            "So I made a  post . He is my first big bird. The only other birds I have had are my two zebra finches, and my foster parakeets who I just recently adopted out. So essentially, I'm still a noob. I have researched a good amount. I had about a day or two to read up on them because the parrot needed to get out as soon as possible so I know I missed some things. I am really clueless when it coes to body language, so any good articles on that would be well appreciated. If it matters, I read the [parrot wizard]( website that someone referred to me, and I think I will be using that process to train him, but if anyone thinks a different process would be better suited for him, please let me know. I'm definitely open to whatever would be best for him. \n When we went to pick him up yesterday, he didn't seem too stressed. He accepted treats through the bars like spray millet and his pellet. The bowl they had in there for him he wasn't able to get to so I'm not sure if he was just hungry and that's why he ate, because usually animals in my experience don't eat if they are stressed. When I got him home, I had to transfer him from his old cage to his new cage, and when I opened the door of the cage, he immediately crawled out and flew around, landing on my window drape pole. I got a perch from the new cage, and put it near him, and he crawled onto it. I then placed him into the new cage, and let him get settled for the rest of the day/night. \n Today, when I came home, I walked up to his cage and decided I would try to give him some treats for some bonding and to find out what he likes. I pulled out the spray millet, and put it in the cage bars, and he went crazy over it - a little too crazy. I don't know if this craziness was aggression or he just really liked the spray millet. He didn't take it gently like yesterday. I'm not even sure if he actually ate it or not. He just attacked it. After a bit, he stopped completely, and I got him a small piece of dried papaya, and he took is very gently this time. I know I should probably try to be not afraid, but his huge beak is a bit unsettling, not to mention all the horror stories my mother and boyfriend have been telling me. Also, every time I walk through the door, he immediately comes up to the front of the cage, like he is waiting for me. I just don't know if this is an aggressive thing or if he is just curious/interested in me. The surrender forms from the old owners say they gave him up because he was just too loud, stating nothing about aggression, so I have hope that he is just exuberant about treats, and really interested in coming out, but I just don't want to risk anything. I would hate for him to bite, and start the relationship off badly, because I really just want to gain his trust and it would be hard to do that if we start things off with me getting bit and probably scaring him from jerking my hand away. What would you suggest? Also, for my rats, I never feed them through the bars because doing so makes them bite through the bars, but their eye sight is poor. Is it the same with parrots?

            "My boyfriend's mother is moving to Florida (near or in Miami, according to boyfriend) and is concerned about her bonded pair, Nemo (2ish yrs) and Leona (age unknown) \n 1) Nemo is prone to illness when he is stressed, more then typical rabbits, so she's worried the drive (17 hours) might stress him out too much. \n 2) Hurricane evacuation. Someone told her there are centers where she and her pets could go in the event of an evacuation, but the drive is 2.5 hours and being there with the bunnies in an unfamiliar place might stress them out. These bunnies are used to a whole room 24/7, and a strict nightly salad with assorted veggies...so spending time away from their schedules could throw them off and cause them to get sick. \n 3) Vet. She doesn't know who to go to (anyone have suggestions who know the area?), or if it will cost significantly more being in the city (which is a problem for a rabbit that has cost her over $3000 in a 2 year span). She is planing on calling some vets down there last I checked, but figured I should mention it. \n 4) She's also concerned because no one that loves/cares about bunnies the way she does (aka my boyfriend and I) will be there to provide support. She is us trimming the nails, coming by when something is wrong, and in general just being able to talk about them to us. \n She is worried to the point she is considering giving them up. They both were fosters of mine, so the rescue would take them back and I would presumably foster them again. But my worry is these bunnies will take a long time to find a suitable home - I would require them to get a whole room to themselves, and the potential adopters would have to understand Nemo has tendencies of getting ill. Not to mention the fact they are a pair, which turns off a lot of potential adopters in my experience. During that time, they will just sit at my home waiting to find a home, and I just don't have the space to give them a full room either sadly. Most I can do is a pen full time and playtime. \n Opinions on any of this?": "Rabbits",
            "I got in a foster rat recently named Chillie, and decided to cage her with my two girls so she could not only have a larger cage while she is here, but also to socialize her with other rats. I think, however, that was a huge mistake on my part. \n They all hit it off perfectly, and Chillie and Misa in particular snuggled and groomed each other immediately upon meeting each other, and now those two in particular are inseparable. Misa has never acted this way around her sister Light, and certainly not with Bev, who just passed away. Also, Chillie is making strides in bravery because Misa accompanies her everywhere.

I'm very worried what is going to happen when Chillie gets adopted. I already crunched the numbers, and I really don't think adopting another rat, who would also need to get spayed, is in the cards for me right now. So now, I don't know what to do. I'm really contemplating adopting my girls with Chillie to a new home so they can all be together, but I feel like such a bad rat mom, even considering adopting out my babies and especially for putting them in this situation to begin with. It was foolish of me. However, I will admit I'm so happy to see Misa genuinely happy again. I think Bevs passing was weighing on her more then she let on, and I'm honestly glad she has Chillie now. \n I'm want to believe I'm not the type of person to keep an animal for myself when they would be obviously happier in a different situation, and I feel Misa, Light, and Chillie would be all happier in a situation where they could be together, but I'm very torn at this point.

However I'm trying to set everything up for him beforehand, and I am curious if he would do alright in my 29 gallon. It has 4 albino cories (I'm thinking of giving these guys a tank of their own soon), 4 sterbai, and 1 bristlenose pleco. The water parameters would be fine for a betta, but I worry that the bristlenose and him wouldn't be compatible tank mates since I have never heard of anyone keeping those types of fish together. The bristlenose (named Persimmons) is very docile, and almost always just hangs out on the driftwood, so I think he would be fine with the betta, but I'm concerned the betta wouldn't be fine for him. The pet store employee said since the tank was so big it would be fine, but I figured I would ask you guys to be sure. \n I also worry that the tank is so tall (maybe 2-3 feet tall if I had to guess) that the betta would have a difficult time breathing. Would that be an issue, or will he be fine. I was thinking of maybe purchasing one of those artificial leaves that stick to the side so he can rest on it then go up to the surface easier, but I also have real broad leafed plants on the bottom of the tank. \n Last but not least, do all bettas turn red and blue with age? I have a betta currently, named Petaya, and when I first got him, he had white tipped fins, and was turquoise with purple/red spots.

            "I felt an overwhelming urge to vent about this. I've been corresponding to a potential adopter for a few weeks now, but the child is only interested in Netherland dwarfs. Not to mention it seems like maybe they really haven't done too much research. I understand not knowing some things if it is the first time getting a certain species, but at the end of the day, a rabbit is a huge responsibility, and if you don't know the answers to questions that could potentially kill the rabbit, then maybe more research is needed. \n The minute I told them that the bunny I have that they were interested in might possibly be a mix of the breed they wanted, they let me know they were no longer interested and were getting in touch with a different rescue. Don't get me wrong, the people themselves seem nice most of the time and I think they might be good owners. I just don't understand what it is with in general people only wanting certain breeds and not being open to the personality instead!

When he first arrived there, he was skittish, but not aggressive. He later got adopted by a family with kids, and was returned a week later extremely aggressive, so much so that I was told they were considering putting him down. This is when I decided to take him as my foster and then later ended up adopting him. I have seen this type of scenario happen so many times to dwarves in particular. It is really just a shame that people see how cute and tiny they are and seem to completely forget the temperament that goes along with the cuteness. Then later, when the family can't handle it anymore, the rabbit ends up being returned much worse then when they left, only to end up in my house or someone else's, having to be trained to trust people again.

            "I can already tell this may be a long post. Sorry in advanced. Last night, I let my rat out for playtime and stupidly forgot to move Solaire's, my hamster, cage from the room. Instantly, my rat attacked her through the bars. I rushed over there, and in my panic I shook the cage to get him off because he wouldn\u2019t let go of her paw, but she fell during this and I think that is maybe when she broke her back leg. It was completely limp and sideways. Her front paw was bleeding, but I have seen worse and it wasn\u2019t too bad. However, when I looked at the broken leg immediately after all this happened, it was also bruised, as though it was older than just a minute or two. It might be that she broke her leg previously that night and I just didn\u2019t notice until then. She has a habit of climbing the ceiling of her cage sometimes, so I theorize she fell while climbing. Aquariums/bin cages from now on! \n I gave her some medicam immediately and moved her to a small aquarium to keep an eye on her after stopping the bleeding from her front paw, and as soon as the vet opened in the morning, took her in to see what they could do about her back leg. They took x-rays, and the tibia/calf bone is completely broken in two and dislocated (I\u2019m having the vet send the xrays to me through email, so when I get them I will post them if people want to see it. The vet tech in me thinks it\u2019s kind of cool I guess oddly enough\u2026) \n Luckily, the break was close to her ankle, so the femur/thigh bone would be able to remain if we chose to amputate. The vet said we could either let it heal on its own, or amputate. I went in there already kind of knowing I was probably going to amputate, because I didn\u2019t want to run the risk of it healing badly and causing her pain for the rest of her life, especially because she is fairly young and has a lot of spunk left in her!\nThe surgery specialist for exotics wasn\u2019t there today though, so we will be returning tomorrow in the morning. She is heavily dosed up on pain killers at the moment to make it comfortably through the night and is currently hoarding food. \n As for my question \u2013 what does everyone think of all this? Is it a waste of time and money? Going in, I was certain of my decision, because I was sure just letting it heal naturally would cause a lot of pain for her in the future, but it seems like people I know have this mentality that \u2018it\u2019s just a hamster\u2019. One person said we were making it suffer and being horrible people, though she said it much meaner and I won\u2019t go into too many details. I am a bit in shock at this though. Solaire is very dear to my boyfriend and I, and she is so young and sweet. Through all of this, she has not once thought to bite me, and was great at the vet even though he had to look at the break and laceration on her paw closely. I would feel awful putting her down if she can live a good life with three legs. I just wish others shared my opinion aside from my boyfriend, mother, and father. Is this just a common thing for people to think? Sure, they cost like 10 bucks at the nearest pet store, but she is a living creature. I would think spending a little money (and the price is actually pretty reasonable by the way) is worth it, but I\u2019m starting to have doubts I guess if I\u2019m doing the right thing. Deep down though, I am almost certain I am. \n Also this is separate, but anyone have any experience with a three legged ham and any advice?

            "Hi, all. I recently had a scare with my pup the first time I fed him a pig's ear. He didn't \"potty\" for three days and, naturally I was concerned. I watched him very, very closely - his energy levels were normal (through the roof!), he was drinking, he didn't appear bloated and had no pain when I pressed on his abdomen. His appetite only slightly decreased on the third day, but I was still concerned. I was just about to rush him to the emergency vet when, lo and behold, he relieved himself (I have never been so happy to see a bowel movement in my life; gross but true). Anyway, my question is this: just how safe are pigs ears? I've read and heard many conflicting things so I'd like to get your opinion. I was looking for a longer-lasting chew since he goes through anything I give him within seconds or minutes. My pup has only had things like stuffed kongs, meaty thing bones or filled thigh bones, bully sticks (real tendons, not pressed rawhide), baked sweet potatoes and the like. Never rawhide. I was looking for a longer-lasting edible chew because he is an extremely strong chewer and constantly needs something to do. He has a plethora of brain toys and is regularly exercised as well. So, I suppose I'm asking two things: \n \n How safe are pig's ears, really? \n What are good alternatives for long-lasting, safe chews?": "DogCare",
            "Hi all. I have a 3 year old Catahoula with a very short, tight coat (basically the \"painted on\" variety). I'd imagine it provides minimal warmth for him and with New England winter this simply will not do. I'm looking for a pretty high quality coat for him made of quality materials that will actually keep him warm. I do not want to buy a light sweater or cheaply insulated coat from Petco as I've bought cheapo coats for myself before and they did not do the job. There's no reason to assume they'd do it for my pup either. I'd prefer a coat that zipped up under his belly to keep it warm and out of contact with snow - no cape styles, please. He's around 55 lbs and a \"tweener\" size, but he's pretty hard to fit for coats. The ones that fit length-wise do not fit around his barrel (narrow but very deep chest like a less-extreme version of a greyhound). I'm willing to pay up to $75 for a coat if I could get multiple seasons out of it. There was a fantastic european company I was looking at that made outdoor gear for dogs, but I can't seem to remember the name any longer. Any and all advice is greatly appreciated!": "DogCare",
            "You could look at it this way: the dogs are not \"failing\" because they do not want what you (not they) have deemed to be \"high value\" rewards. For these dogs, they consider their toys high value rewards rather than the food you are presenting. Every dog is motivated by different things and although cheese and bacon will hold most dogs attention, to some it can mean absolutely nothing in the presence of a ball. Consider this: your friend likes ice cream. You, on the other hand, prefer cake. Are you going to run a mile for a tub of ice cream? Maybe not, but would you for cake? Heck yeah! Is one preference more \"correct\" than the other? Absolutely not - they're just  different.  Try incorporating the use of these toys into training in place of food and you will likely have a lot of success. Restrict the dogs' access to the toys before walks or training, and try working with the toys with a little structure. For example, have the dogs on leash, and ask for a command. If they perform said command, mark it (either verbally or with a clicker) and reward them with the toy. You can either throw it (if they reliably drop it), let them mouth it, whatever. Just control their arousal levels and keep them in a \"thinking\" mode. A toy ball attached to a handle or rope like  this . \n My dog is similarly toy/play motivated and, given the choice, will ALWAYS choose to chase a ball rather than eat gravy covered, stinky-delicious steak. Once I took a moment to actually analyze the information my dog was giving me and worked it into his training program we had a huge surge in progress. Not all dogs are built the same and should not be forced into the same \"programs\" or training methods, in spite of the information these dogs are constantly communicating to us. Being a good owner/trainer/handler/dog-savvy individual requires the ability to identify the information these dogs are conveying and being flexible and creative enough to use it in a constructive way. Basically, stop with the treats and pick up the ball. It could very well work! \n Hope this helps a bit. I'd be interested to hear how it goes!": "Dogtraining",
            "I fully agree with the sentiment that women who don't wear makeup judge more harshly (recent discussion about the attitudes of the women over in r/gonenatural backs this up). I'm dealing with that with my boyfriend's mother who routinely puts zero effort into her appearance - doesn't wear makeup, doesn't do her hair, wears plain clothes and claims she \"doesn't care about these things,\" having explicitly and repeatedly said that people who are concerned with these things are shallow and ridiculous. I'm sorry, but why go out of your way to comment about my eyeshadow color (light brown and cream are \"outlandish\" now?!), stand behind me while I'm curling my hair to shake your head disapprovingly, or make a snarky comment about my sun dress? I don't go out of my way to comment on the fact that you seem to only own khakis, have the bowl cut of a twelve year old boy, don't own even concealer and are generally a rude bitch.  How RIDICULOUS of me to put effort into my appearance for work or play. \n Here's what it comes down to for me: People automatically judge others on their physical appearance and the effort they  put into grooming themselves. Studies have shown time and time again that people who are deemed \"less attractive\" are discriminated against - jobs, pay, attention from the opposite sex, even perceived \"trustworthiness.\" I know this; you know this. While I don't necessarily agree with this treatment, it's a simple fact of life. We unknowingly are attracted to people who appear to have the best genes, and facial symmetry = \"good\" genes = desirable. While I do not wear makeup to attract the opposite sex, I do it to avoid these prejudices and boost my self esteem in the process. I find it a little funny, however, that I am now being discriminated against by a whole other group of people: non-makeup wearing women. I honest to goodness would not give TWO SHITS if she (and other women who have treated me similarly - there have been many) didn't wear makeup. I start caring when you go out of your way to make me feel like shit about it. I was not judging you until you \"decided\" what type of person I was. At least I've decided who you are based on your actions and not something as shallow as what you do or do not choose to put on your face. \n Also noteworthy to point out that I've found many of these women to be both insecure and intimidated by someone who they perceive as more attractive than them, so naturally girl-on-girl hate follows. No, I don't think I'm a beauty queen (in fact, I don't think I'm pretty at all). I just think you feel bad about yourself and are therefore trying to make me feel worse.": "MakeupAddiction",
            "Hi all! I am currently trying to replace the fencing at my grandmother's house as it has needed serious repair for several years now. My grandfather died over a year ago and I've moved in to try to help around the property. He did all of the work on the house himself with little to no experience, so things are a bit wonky and not at all uniform. As a result, things are a little difficult to repair. \n The fence in the back section on the yard was 4 ft. The ground is very wet and that area of the yard regularly floods so cinder blocks were placed into the ground for the fencing to sit on top of. Metal posts were put inside the blocks in cement at 8 ft increments (+/- six inches; makes tearing them down a little annoying). The fence was fixed to the poles with metal pipe straps. It is not the most secure setup and certainly not better than sitting wooden posts in the ground but it is what is in place, and I have no intention of hauling away a makeshift cinder block \"wall.\" The pipes are still in fine condition but all the stockade needs to be replaced. My problem lies here: after buying 4 ft. x 8 ft.  sections (as requested), the family now wants 6 ft. tall sections. However, the pipes are not tall enough to reach the bracing around the back of the fencing where they will be screwed in.

He is up to date on shots and is regularly exercised. He goes for a minimum of two one-hour walks (morning and afternoon) and visits the dog park every other day. He is also played with daily in the yard (fetch, scent tracking/hide-and-seek with toys, training drills, etc) and has plenty of interactive toys like Kongs and food puzzles to keep him mentally stimulated. Basically, he has a great life and is very well taken care of so PLEASE leave out these accusations as they are flat out offensive and completely off base.

            "Hello all,\nI hope this is the right place to post this. I have a question regarding managing my fear aggressive, reactive dog. Here's the skinny: I have a 2 yr old neutered Catahoula. He went to live with a family member for several months when he was younger when my living situation became impossible (roommate had a mental break down, began obsessing over me, harassing me, threatened to sue when I tried to move out, etc... Hell.). When my pup came back, my once well mannered, well socialized dog had major anxiety, fear aggression, and a host of other issues. After countless hours of research, thousands of dollars spent on awful training programs (I will NEVER have an e-collar again), many, many tears and sleepless nights, and generally feeling hopeless, I have  FINALLY  found a program and amazing trainer who is actually getting us somewhere. The training is called TACT - touch associated clicker training- and it's essentially positive reinforcement geared toward reactive and aggressive dogs. (Side note: My trainer is an amazingly knowledgeable, supportive and caring person. I have never met a professional trainer so devoted to actually helping anyone, especially extremely difficult cases like ours. If you are in the area, GO SEE HER.) Our current protocol focuses a great deal on the management of these dogs, which is different than managing a \"normal\" dog. It includes \n \n Blocking access to windows with window \"frost\" (he is reactive to both visual stimuli and noise) \n Restricting access to a smaller area of the house, and eliminating access to areas where he rehearsed problematic behaviors \n Increasing and varying brain toys for times when he is alone \n Reducing noise with a sound machine \n \n My main issue deals with the fact that he is confined to two small rooms on the upper level of the house, directly above the kitchen (noisiest area). I have a sheet hanging in the stairwell leading up to the rooms and a baby gate to physically/visually block triggers but the sheet does absolutely nothing for noise reduction. The white noise machine helps a great deal, but I need to add another layer here. The reactions to noises are still severe, and I clearly need to increase my management in this area. I have tried thicker comforters as a barrier and they also do little. I know that there are sound-blocking materials specifically for this purpose but they are hundreds of dollars and, as it is, I am already struggling. So,  here is my question : does anyone know of a material I can hang in the stair well leading up to the rooms in which he is confined that will effectively reduce noise? Has anyone dealt with a similar situation?": "DogCare"

While the average domestic cat is far friendlier than a wild cat, they're still not naturally \"cuddly\" animals. \n One thing: Don't be an \"alpha\" and force a cat to sit in your lap.  While multi-cat households will have a dominance hierarchy, there's no \"alpha\" and \"beta\" like a wolf or dog pack.

Offer treats during this time to remind him that people are awesome. \n Many cats never turn into cuddlers.  They're more comfortable just chilling in the same room as you.

How happy will they be in five years when they figure-out that Mommy and Daddy don't love each other and are only together \"for them\"?  What about when Mommy cheats on Daddy and there are fights every night?  Or when Mommy starts drinking because she's not happy? \n Have you been single AT ALL in the past nine years?  Not to criticize you, but it sounds like you've been spending a lot of time trying to make men happy and very little time finding happiness for yourself.  Yes, I know you've been in bad situations (two unexpected children), but that's more reason to make sure you're happy with YOU.  It might be a good idea to stay away from ALL of these relationships and just work on making your way on your own for a little but.  Do you have a female friend you can live with? \n As for your family - I have known a few people (including my own mother) who have had to make a break from their families for personal reasons.  All of them looked-back on their decisions as good, even though it was hard at the time.  Some of them were able to repair relationships years later, while others never were.  However, if your family is more interested in appearances than your happiness or well-being, you may need to step away from them for a while.  Things may get better, they may not.  However, you will be free to make your own decisions and not have to worry about what is \"proper.\" \n As for the stigma of having two children by two different fathers - Yes, it exists.  However, this is 2011 and not 1950.  It's not what happened in the past, it's what happens in the future.  Do you become the victim of circumstances, or do you take charge and make a way for yourself?

            "Classic Tabby\" is a pattern variety, not a breed.  It's one of four tabby patterns, and comes in a variety of breeds and colors.  You're probably seeing American or British shorthairs which tend to be bulkier, stockier cats with somewhat rounded muzzles.  However, the \"classic tabby\" pattern appears in several breeds. \n Coat also depends on breed (not pattern).  Shedding and \"scruffiness\" are based on coat length (long, medium, short) and undercoat (thick and wooly vs. sleek and smooth).  All cats get scruffier and shed more at certain times of the year, though some breeds (like maine coons) get more scruffy than others (like siamese).  When petting a potential cat, feel the coat.  Is it thick and plush or thin and silky?  The thicker coat will shed a LOT more. \n The rule to keeping a cat slender is the same for people.  Plenty of play and good quality food (wet, dry, or both) in appropriate proportions will help keep a cat slim.  If kitty is looking chubby, cut back on the food (and/or switch to diet) and play with him/her more (cat teasers are AWESOME). \n I only know indoor kitties because I live in the city and cat vs. car never ends well.  If you have the ground and are willing to take the risks associated with the indoor/outdoor lifestyle, make sure the cat imprints (at least two week) on his/her new home before going outside.  Spend the two weeks providing treats, food, toys, and lovin' to remind the cat that your home is the BEST PLACE EVER.  Also, make sure the cat is neutered/spayed, up-to-date on shots, wormed regularly, microchipped, and treated with flea protection (frontline, advantix, etc) before going out. \n ONE FINAL NOTE:  My suggestion is to go down to the local shelter/cat rescue/family fostering kittens and see if there are any cats you like.  There are usually a bajillion tabbies (mostly mackerel, but also agouti, spotted, and classic) available, many of who are lovely and sleek.  Instead of looking at a breeder, save a life!": "cats",

            "Super text wall warning \n There probably are some differences between your full service vet and a high volume clinic.  That being said I helped start one and worked at another. \n Part of the way our costs were lower is because there was less overhead.  We didn't offer anything other than the surgery, vaccination, fecals, a few in house tests, and microchipping.  This limited the amount of supplies and equipment we needed to buy.  Also, we received a few large grants to help subsidize the cost.  The veterinary staff was extremely experienced and competent because the speciality was so focused (high volume s/n).  As a nonprofit we also had volunteers to cover some of the janitorial stuff--allowing the veterinary staff to maximize their time with patients. \n Our vet came to us because he loved surgery but was getting burnt out with the day to day of a full service practice.  I was hired because I'm very passionate about non profit animal rescue and I really like the uniqueness of shelter medicine.  I didn't have to tech for surgeries that I found unethical (declawing). \n The positive of s/n at a full service vet is that you will probably be offered more pre op testing and time with the doctor performing the surgery.  The waiting list for a surgucal appointment will likely be shorter, as well.  If something went  really  wrong the larger clinic would probably have a larger arsenal of tools to work with.  I'm thinking a blood transfusion or something equally serious.  (Our clinic was within two minutes of a full service that we could transport to if necessary). \n Ultimately ask questions directly to both clinics.  Ask for a tour of their operating room and recovery areas.  Find out their policies for post op emergencies and follow ups.  Ask friends if they've heard anything concerning about either place.  Professional courtesy might prevent the full service clinic from answering but I'd also ask the staff if they have concerns about the high volume you're considering.  If they name something bring it up at the clinic to get their side.  For example a vet in my area was telling clients we weren't using pain medication.

He'll forget I'm gone after five or ten minutes when left with someone else. I just don't get it. Am I doing something wrong? He always has his food when I'm gone, his toys, his treats, ect. I've even tried different people with different dogs thinking it may be something environmental at a friends house. But, Nope! He always comes home with a hot spot. \n Another weird thing, his most recent hot spot occurred on a camping trip last week. Yes, he's been camping before and he was fully vaccinated and had a fresh (week old) dose of anti-critter treatment (mosquitos, fleas, ticks, the works). Granted, I was away for about a day on a less dog friendly trail without him. However, he wasn't alone at the campsite, and even had a few of his best buds there. But, towards the end of the trip, literally an hour before we left, he got really agitated trying to run off his leash, jumping in the air, barking. These are all  behaviors totally foreign to his normal personality. \n I don't know. Maybe I'm just overreacting. \n I'll post pictures of his hot spot if you guys want to see what I'm working with. He literally bites chunks of fur out in one spot, and alwayssss the same damn spot. \n Helpppp. What can I do to prevent these? And what other treatment options do I have besides the cone and ointment combo? \n Thanks in advance.": "dogs",
            "Http://Www.youcaring.com/odin \n I've seen reddit pull off miracles before, and I'm in desperate need of one. While I may not be needing ingredients for the perfect potato salad, as one redditor on kickstarter had done, I do need financial support for my siberian husky Odin and his fight against cancer. \n Odin has cobblestone shaped adenocarcinoma. Basically, that's intestinal cancer. It has metastasized to one other part of his body, but his prognosis looks very promising if he gets the type of treatment he needs! \n We all know vet bills can be disgustingly expensive, but I think most, if not all of us, would do anything to preserve our pets quality of life. Odin is my best friend. I need him to get through this. He's only six, and I've only had him for less than two years. \n I've done everything I could think of to get his bill taken care of. I've contacted siberian husky groups, husky rescues, humane societies, local veterinarians, I've taken out as much care credit as I possibly could, I've messaged any animal group on facebook I could think of, I've scraped together every last penny without screwing myself over for priority bills, I've requested more hours from my employer, and I've even looked into a second job. (if I've missed anything, let me know, please!) \n What I need now is around $1,100. They won't do the surgery unless I can pay the bill in full. So, I have a surgery scheduled for October 15th, just a couple days after Odin's birthday, and that's my deadline for this fundraiser. \n Even if you can't donate, please upvote, share on Facebook, let someone know about my cause, or even send me an encouraging message with any ideas or thoughts you may have. Anything helps, even a dollar. If you do decide to donate, you'll get some goodies along with your automatic payment of good karma! \n Please help me save my best friend. I love him to the moon and back and I can't imagine him not winning this battle. \n Here's the link to his fundraising site: \n Http://Www.youcaring.com/odin \n And here's a bonus album of my handsome little man for staying until the end!": "Assistance",
            "So, we've had this guy for about a year now. His name is Garth. He's a pug pekingese mix who is about two and a half years old. We also have a seven year old siberian husky, Odin. I've had Odin for two and a half years. He was a rescue and came with his own deck of problems, but I worked him through all of them and he's a fantastic dog! \n Garth was a little neglected when we got him, but nothing terrible. He still had a pretty decent life. We've trained him to do some tricks and he's very smart and catches on quickly. \n However. \n Leash training him has been a literal hell for me. He's also dog and sometimes human aggressive while on walks. He'll bark relentlessly. We've tried positive reinforcement, socializing him with other friendly dogs, training with professionals.. Everything. What am I missing?! Since we've had him, he's had zero negative interactions with other dogs. He's never even been growled at! He will just immediately launch into bark mode. \n Now, the last couple months, he's been even worse. He'll try attacking other dogs and will NOT snap out of it unless we pick him up and carry him like a human child. Even then, he'll still growl and huff. And the rest of the walk he'll be on high alert for anything and everything to bark at. Once back inside, he's fine. And will put his ears back and lay in his kennel because he knows what he did was bad. \n It's just so embarrassing. I have a huge husky who could care less and just wants to smell the dog if given the Okay command by me, and this fat pug who acts like a psychopath. \n He'll bark inside the house too. If there's a noise he's unfamiliar with, or a voice, car horn, door, birds, etc. While inside, he's easily managed. He listens to commands pretty well and will come to me, sit, stay and hush until the noise goes away. Outside, there's no getting through to him. \n What. Do. I. Do?!": "OpenDogTraining",

After hearing a lot of talk from members about how Augusta is walled in, as well as making the resident map, I propose that residents will state how many plots they already own each time they derelict a new plot. \n This allows other citizens to veto dereliction on the basis of preserving land for more new citizens, preventing a monopoly of land, and preventing the arising of unused buildings.": "MtAugusta",
            "I'm a young looking 23 year old Asian guy. I was entering my first year teaching at the high school level. The first day was last week and I had told all of my department members I was going to do it. Some of them even helped set it up. \n The day went hilariously. \n I wrote up on the board \"INSTRUCTIONS: Introduce yourself to as many people as you can and tell your  best  story!\" I had different coworkers come into my class period at the beginning of each prep and tell the students Mr. Augustane was running late making copies. My students were to begin the activity without me until I arrived. \n I wore a hoodie over my dress shirt and tie and brought one of my old backpacks. During the periods I sat down in the seats and introduced myself as the new student named 'Jeremy Lin' and told some of my best stories. Dates and age were changed of course, haha. About 5-10 minutes after introducing myself and hearing several students' stories, I would step to the front of the class and stand on a table, then reveal myself... to the shock of all of my students. It was pretty funny how some students who were quite  caddy  catty looked when they realized who I was. \n In one period in particular, however, I was seated next to a gentleman who proceeded to tell me \"Oh man, this period is going to go APESHIT.\" The conversation continued like this: \n Him: I had [name], [name], and [name] in my ___ class last year and we  wrecked  wreaked havoc. We drove that teacher nuts. \n Me: Oh. [name], [name], and [name]? \n Him: Yeah. They're cool guys. I'm pretty sure we're going to eat this teacher alive. \n Me: Why? \n Him: He's a first year teacher. They never know what the hell they're doing. All they ever do is stick to the textbook and generally suck. \n Me: Do you know anything else about this Mr. Augustane? \n Him: No, not really, but he's probably going to be really slow and boring. First year teachers always are. He won't have control of this class. I don't think he'll be any good. \n At that moment, I put my hand on his shoulder, and said something along the lines of \"Don't worry buddy, I'm sure I'll do fine.\" before stepping up to the class and revealing myself. The class really did go apeshit, but for different reasons. (: \n The look on that kid's face was priceless. I was sure to thank him for pointing out all the trouble makers for me afterwards. \n By 5th and 6th period, all the students were scanning around trying to figure out where I could've been hiding. They were accusing different Asian students of being the teacher. \n Overall it was a great start before laying down the rules and syllabus the following day. I was nervous it was going to be a terrible idea, but now my students won't stop joking about it.": "Teachers",
            "Hi there. I have an adorable guy named Ted who's 3 1/2 years old. He's fixed and lives with myself, my girlfriend, another cat, and my dog. \n He's had a few issues with peeing outside the litterbox about a year ago, but it was corrected with CatAttract litter. However his inappropriate urinating has come back in full force without any rhyme or reason. I made sure to take him to the vet ASAP, but they found nothing. He's specifically attacking our couch, but has peed on piles of laundry and our bath mat. \n He did not begin inappropriately urinating with the introduction of the second cat or dog, so I do not think it is territorial or stress induced from the other animals. However I tried my best to cover the bases by purchasing two FeliAway diffusers for my place. I also remembered to switch over to CatAttract. I then switched to a UTI preventative food that help prevent crystals that may cause urinating, as well as making sure he gets a can of wet food every 1-2 days. \n Despite all of this, I'm still waking up every 1-2 days to puddles of urine on my couch. Previously it had been piles of clothing and the bath mat (until I threw that out). I don't understand what's going on! It's been a month of this and I've spent so much money on laundry! \n What should I do? Please help me!": "Pets",
            "I want to start with a bit of background. \n I'm a very lucky guy. Extremely lucky. I won the lottery at birth with two absolutely amazing parents. They've helped me save up my retirement, paid my entire college tuition (undergraduate and graduate), and have taken every precaution to make sure that I (and whatever family I may eventually have) will be set for life. \n My aunt is an extremely kind hearted woman, but she has a medley of psychological issues. She suffers from paranoia schizophrenia and refuses to acknowledge she has a problem. She divorced a very successful man and received hundreds of thousands in their divorce, but still believes he, the mafia, and government is out to ruin her 10 years later. \n She decided to create her own real estate business with her divorce money in the middle of the 2008 recession. She held onto that business until 2013 when she was reduced to living in her car. Eventually after her business closed, she moved in with my grandma. This was to the distaste of a lot of family members, especially since they saw her as a mooch and had warned her about ditching her business sooner. It was also frustrating because she refused to get any job considered 'menial' because she believed it was below her. She wanted to be her own boss, so she's been mostly jobless since then. \n She is my dad's younger sister and is very close to him, mainly because he is the only sibling (of 11) who takes time to listen to her and supports her through her issues. He's the most successful in the family and occasionally gives her money to get by. I'm close to her too since I really sympathize with her. None of my other 24 cousins ever talk to her at family gatherings because they don't want to hear her talk about the mafia. Her own adult son doesn't let her see her grandchild because of her issues. She had to sneak into her grandson's school just to give him his birthday present. It's heartbreaking. I've tried my best whenever I visited my grandma to take both her and my grandma to lunch, which is about once a month. While she doesn't acknowledge it, she's sick, just like how I had suffered from depression in the past. I can relate to that. \n So here's the situation. \n I recently finished my masters degree and my parents decided to basically gift me most of a house in my hometown. They're selling it to me at half the market value with no interest on my payments, with payment scaling with my salary so that I can afford cost of living (it's a very expensive area to live in). So of course I based all of my plans around this house and landed a job in the area. All contracts signed. \n My dad suddenly brings it up to me, after I've signed the contracts, that he would like me to let my aunt live in what would become a modified extension of the house. My grandma was downsizing and couldn't house my aunt any longer. I love my aunt dearly, but I'm just  not comfortable with this at all.  He's been pressuring me, to my mom's protest, to agree to it. He's been stating that the house was such an extravagant gift and it's too much for just me and my girlfriend to live in by ourselves. \n I need my privacy. Both my girlfriend and I will be living there and we want it to be 'our space'. If I had known before signing the contract with my job, I wouldn't have agreed. I would've just lived and worked somewhere more affordable. \n Now I've just finished up my masters degree and my aunt gave me an iPhone 6 Plus as a present. I'm not sure if she's doing this out of the generosity of her heart, since I'm the only kid in the family to make an effort to treat her like a real human being, or if this is something to 'help' me in my decision. Where she got the money for it, lord knows. It's well beyond her means. I already have an iPhone 6 that I've only had 4 months. I don't like the 6 plus because it feels like a tablet more than a phone. At this point I honestly want to just give the phone to my dad for Father's Day because 1) he deserves it for everything he's done for me 2) his vision is getting worse and it'll be easier for his eyes 3) I don't want the phone to go to waste. \n I don't know how awkward that'll be though, if she knows I re-gifted her present. At the same time... I just don't like the phone! How awkward is it if I don't use it? Isn't it a waste? Do I just suck it up and use it? I also worry what might happen if she personally presses me to live at the house instead of through my dad (I sure hope she doesn't). Will the phone possibly be used at leverage? By her or my dad? What do I do and how do I do it tactfully?": "relationships",

            "About a month ago I posted [this]( thread in /r/dogs and [this]( in /r/australianshepherd asking for advice on an Australian Shepherd puppy I was going to adopt. I knew that I wanted my puppy a long time ago, did the research, but was extremely worried about things I might not have been able to expect. I didn't know if my cats would hate him, if crate training was going to be difficult, or if I would even be able to properly train him from such a young age among other things. My parents' constant doubt and warnings about young puppies didn't help either. \n Because of the holidays and timing, I ended up getting my 'lil guy a little early too! He's only seven weeks old instead of eight. I seriously didn't know what to expect, but despite that, I was still shocked with what happened next. \n My pup, August [you probably see the theme I have going], was extremely calm around my cats when they met. Mind you he's had no training or interaction with cats up to this point. I immediately started teaching him a \"leave\" command and he picked up on it very quickly. After half an hour, he no longer rushed at my cats, which made them much calmer around him. Within another hour they were able to coexist in the same room without any hissing. Within two hours my pup had made friends with my younger cat, where both started drinking from the same water bowl. I....didn't see that coming. \n As for basic house training, aside from peeing on the floor the first moment he came into the house, he has had 0 accidents. He's voided himself promptly every time I've taken him out and said \"potty\". Like clockwork, he whines and begs at the same time intervals, which has made potty training a breeze. He's also left the cats' food and litter alone after a couple scoldings. This has only been the second night with him, but he's been solid about avoiding anything I tell him to \"leave\" or say \"no\" to. He even naturally slept in his crate the first night and is sleeping in the closed crate as I'm typing this. Aside from the occasional reminding \"no\"s and whining in the crate, the first two nights with my pup have been worry-free. I've had to wake up every two hours, but he's so consistent, that I'm getting solid blocks of sleep. \n While I know accidents are unavoidable and will eventually happen, I can't help but be amazed at how quickly August has picked up everything I've trained him to do. He's exponentially becoming more obedient, responsive, and behaving. I'd say he's easier than the kids that I work with at my job. \n I can't wait for the adventures we're going to have together, especially since he's already been amazing so early. He really is a Christmas miracle for me. I just really needed to share this with the world. \n Thanks so much for the advice and support in my previous thread.

I got out of an abusive relationship about a year ago and have since found a really really incredible man. Before my abusive relationship ended, though, I was absolutely miserable. I dropped out of school, didn't get out of bed for days, never went to my scheduled appointments. The only thing that got me out of my funk was my new lab, Buddy, who I adopted when he was very very sick. I got him healthy again and he was the love of my life, but my ex-boyfriend took him when I left. I could not keep him in the apartment I had gotten because the landlord didn't allow 100 lb protective puppies in the apartment. In February I rescued a pregnant cat. She was a stray and was wandering around looking for a place to go. I took her in, thinking it'd be nice to have a pet in my 1 bedroom apartment. She had 7 kittens a week later, and I was there through the whole process. It was amazing, and I felt so maternal towards those kittens. I found homes for Momma and all but two kittens. I kept them for a while. Well, turns out, even though my landlord only told me \"dogs are not allowed\", cats aren't allowed either. I just didn't check my lease. They found the kittens, I got evicted, and had to move in with my parents 30 minutes from my home, my boyfriend, and my babies. I left the kittens in the care of a friend while I tried to find a place that would allow me to have them, all the while spending too much money on the eviction. I was going to move in with my boyfriend, but his roommates protested all too loudly. That was two weeks ago.

After screaming my head off on the coaster for 2 minutes while the kid sat nonplussed, we got off and I said \"So how are we gonna find your parents?\" We walked down the exit and a man and another child were standing there and said to the kid \"Hey man, how's it going?\" And that's where we parted ways. I was shocked that this kid's father had lost his 6 year old for 45-60 minutes and THAT was his reaction, and I couldn't stop thinking about it for the entire day. Some parents.": "AskReddit",
            "Hi /r/CatTraining, hoping you folks can shed some light on a situation I've been experiencing with my kitty. \n Background: I rescued Bridger about 3 months ago and he initially integrated really well into our family (myself and two dogs). He is about a year old now and had no problem eating dry food with the occasional can and using a pine pellet litter. He's a very quiet, mellow cat and fun to have around. \n The issue: Two weekends ago I went away for the weekend and left him with a circulating water fountain, a gravity-fed kibble feeder, and two clean litter boxes. Left Friday, came back Sunday to no problems. Did the same thing last weekend and came home to a single pile of poop 3 feet from the litter box. Ok, figured he was \"upset\" that I was gone. Next time I'll have someone drop in and check on him on Saturday (I went away for 5 days about a month after I got him and had a neighbor come by once a day and he did not report any stray poops or other issues). While this is an inconvenience, it's somewhat understandable that he's stressed by the change in schedule. Well, since last weekend he has not pooped in the litter box. I work close to home so often come home for lunch, but there are days when I need to work through lunch and am unable to come home. My two dogs don't have an issue with being inside for 8 hours but all this week I've come home to a pile of poop 3 feet from the litter box. He still pees in the box, however. This morning, I woke up to poop outside the box. I wasn't even gone, I was home all night. He just doesn't poop in the litter box anymore apparently. \n There is not a problem with cleanliness of the box; I dumped all the litter and replaced it with fresh. He also still had both litter boxes out. I recently put away the second litter box since that was the only thing that changed, still pooped on floor. I have a Feliway diffuser on its way to see if that helps (not sure what the community's opinion of those are, it was suggested by the rescue group). I could try switching the litter but I really dislike the dust/smell of clay litters and doubt that's the issue because he still pees there and had no issue until I went away. \n I'm really exasperated and at a loss! It's one thing for him to be stressed about me going away all weekend, but what's the deal with pooping on the floor overnight or while I'm just at work? What do I do if he can't be unsupervised without pooping outside the box for less than 8 hours? Thanks for any advice you can offer.": "CatTraining",

            "I work at a big box chain pet store. We have over a hundred tanks that all share the same water system (plus the separate feeder fish system that houses comets and minnows). I generally work in a different area of the store but help out with the fish a lot because I used to work in the fish department and I enjoy spending time over there. I have a small tank of my own and went to pick up a guppy I was interested as I was leaving for the day. Unfortunately I noticed he was not doing well, which saddened and confused me because I had seen him not an hour earlier and he was perfectly healthy and beautiful. I walked further down the wall and noticed there was definitely a bigger problem than that. \n At least half the fish were already dead and more were struggling at the surface. While it's normal to have a few dead fish here and there since we have so many and had just got a new shipment yesterday, I knew something was really wrong. I ran back to the sump and one of my fellow employees had already noticed a problem as well. The water in the sump was foamy and \"dirty\" looking. We started a water change and tested the water but it was too late already. Almost all the fish were dead. \n I grabbed some cups and started scooping out the fish that looked like they might have a chance. Some oscars, bigger goldfish, gouramis, and plecos. Unfortunately about half of those fish ended up dying even once I set up smaller 10 gallon tanks for them with fresh water and stress coat, but a few look like they may survive. Some of the fish I had removed to try and save began to bleed from their gills before dying. \n Currently, according to the manufacturer of the system who was contacted by my manager when we noticed the problem and were struggling to find an answer (and which I suspected immediately as well) the prevailing theory is that someone (presumably a customer or disgruntled ex-employee?) poisoned the system by pouring something into the tanks when they were unattended. This would have been relatively easy to do as there were only two people working in that department who could have been helping other customers and not noticed. The tank lids are not locked either and we have no security cameras. And because the entire system shares the same water if something was dumped in one tank it would have been redistributed throughout all the tanks pretty quickly. We will probably never find out who did it but have taken samples of the water for testing to hopefully find out exactly what happened. \n I am just completely disheartened by this entire event. To see even one fish die in your own tank is saddening but to witness a massacre like this and feel powerless to help is unfathomable. Regardless of how you might feel about corporate pet stores or a particular person what kind of monster/psychopath does this?? They may be \"just fish\" but they were beautiful living creatures and hundreds just suffered a horrible death for no reason. While we don't know for sure that this was really caused by a malicious act, I really can't see how this could have happened otherwise. No huge changes in the system within the last hour, system was running fine to everyone's knowledge. In any case, just wanted to post this somewhere where people might understand how affected I am over this. What a nightmare.": "Aquariums",
            "So my awesome bro got me an Amazon gift card for way too much money.

            "Small-time EDM DJ here with a few thoughts. \n I'm troubled by what appears to me as a wider trend of misogyny in the EDM scene. I'll admit, there's certainly misogyny in other music scenes as well, but that doesn't justify anything. Think about the mix of a club environment that encourages go-go dancers and scantily-clad ravers and you'll quickly see how it is becoming a race to the bottom, where girls are wearing less and less to stand out more. I would argue that its partially due to the institution of go-go dancing, and although go-go is certainly less objectifying than outright stripping, it reflects the same issue, as it is still the practice of paying women to dance and be sexy for the pleasure of paying on-lookers. Its no fault of the dancers, its the fault of the system that would have, as part of the performance, scantily-clad women put on a pedestal for event-goers. I ask you, where are the male go-goers? Where are the men wearing bikini bottoms and little else? Where are the men who are surrounded by staring, would-be predators? (They're at Chipmunks!) \n Men and women both play into it, but frankly, it's unnecessary, and it'll take both women and men standing up to it to change it. Aside from the societal implications, I worry that it contributes to making the EDM scene 'creepy' as well, attracting people interested more in eye-fucking than enjoying the music, making everybody else (men and women alike) uncomfortable expressing themselves in the process, and making it harder for sticks-in-the-mud like me to enjoy these kinds of events. \n It creates an ecosystem in which women are objectified en masse, becoming prey for would-be male predators looking to grope, grind upon, and potentially sexually assault. Remember hearing about [the girl who got raped outside a Rusko show in Chicago on NYE]( Sure, it's a relatively isolated incident, but my weekly EDM event in Worcester, MA is often enjoyed by men who neither know nor care about the music, and instead come to gawk at the 18 year old scantily-clad raver girls. \n Another example of this misogyny is the use of porn (or extremely provocative images of women) on youtube and music blogs as 'images' related to the music. The mostly-nude model/massive cleavage/image of a woman's thonged backside that I'm forced to look at to enjoy the dubstep song you posted on youtube doesn't make the song any better. It doesn't even relate to the song. It just exemplifies the growing bond between EDM and misogyny. \n So EDMers, I leave you with these closing thoughts. Ladies, you should be free to dress sexy if you'd like to, but don't do it for anybody but yourself. And don't tolerate being treated like somebody sexual object. You're a person, dammit. And guys, just because a woman is dressed sexy doesn't mean she wants you or anybody else. Be respectful. Be a man. Don't prey on anybody. That means touching/ogling/grinding without consent. Remember, consent is sexy.": "electronicmusic",
            "Really ents, either high-end raws or low-end Zig-Zags? I am unimpressed. \n There is a multitude of choices in rolling papers because each roller values different factors when it comes to their smoking experience. There are varied lengths, widths, materials used, packaging, and features that set every brand apart. But IMO, it isn't the brands that you need to worry about. It's the aforementioned specs. \n Length, width, material, and packaging are going to impact your rolling experience. As a sapling, I'd recommend using something wide and forgiving, at least 1 & 1/4's or 1.5's. That measurement  reefers  to the width of the rolling surface. Widely-available brands like EZ-Wider and Zig-Zags are probably the best place to start. If you just don't have the manual dexterity to enjoy rolling, you can use a rolling machine, but as an ent who finds rolling to be an art, fuck that. But that's just it... start there, but don't end there. \n After some practice, start experimenting with different kinds of papers and kinds of j's. For me, a slow burn is priority #1. If you're like me (snobby yet frugal) and want the joint to make it back to you twice in a large group, this is a factor that will  eventually  matter a lot to you. In my humble experience, standard rice papers like ZZ's and EZ-Widers burn really fast. Like... annoyingly fast. I postulate that it's the thickness of the paper itself. So once you have your technique down, I would largely avoid those if possible. \n Raws are hard to stick at first and maybe I'm racist, but I find that white joints just look much better. Don't use cellulose papers unless you want to see the tar and carcinogens you're inhaling... unpleasant. \n Personally, I roll with King Size papers, which are longer, slimmer, and thinner, and will provide a remarkably longer burn. Most recently, I've been using Elements and Smoking brand king sizes. Smoking is the definitive brand... so many options in all sizes and a slow burn every time. I'm only using the Elements because they come, as a roll, in a neato little dispenser, seen [here]( But then again, I like mine long and slender, as they will burn much slower than a more chode-like rolling style will. \n Finally, you may one day learn the 'Dutch' or 'inside-out' technique. This technique is known and used by the senseis of the weed world. If you haven't heard of this technique, make a visit to the Dam. You'll see there. Happy Rolling.": "saplings",
            "I'm late to the party, but here goes nothing: \n A group of kids were riding around the neighborhood at my university, and pulled up to me as I smoked a cigarette on the curb, waiting for my friends. They were laughing and asked me for directions to the street one block over. I responded with 'are you serious? it's right there' and pointed at the street. I noticed they were giggling awkwardly, and didn't really understand why. Then the driver drove forward a few feet, rolled down the back window, and someone in the back seat threw a full, unopened can of beer directly at my face from no more than 3 feet away.

            "I know this doesn't really answer your question, but hear me out. \n IMHO, incorruptible Congressional candidates cannot exist in our political system. Yes, there are certainly politicians (like those you mentioned) who are less prone to the siren call of corruption, but the problem is systemic, so even those with the best intentions will still find themselves dependent on a corrupt system to sustain their position within that system. Here's my line of thinking. \n Just like anybody who has a job they like, those in Congress (usually) want to be re-elected as many times as they can. In the metaphorical bonfire that represents our problematic political system, that reality is the fire-pit. \n The US is a country where a  successful  congressional candidacy costs, on average, about a million dollars. And that's just in the House. Senatorial campaigns average several times that cost. (Source: [Mother Jones: 2010 Campaign Expenditures]( So already, the bonfire of corruption has its kindling: legislators who, at the outset of their career, are fundamentally dependent on significant financial backing for success. \n Add to that the Citizens United decision, which allows corporations (i.e. groups of wealthy people sharing a common interest in continued profitability) to contribute to campaigns just like they are any other struggling, lower-to-middle-class American. As competition heats up between campaigns (in terms of fundraising, attack ads, touring, etc.) their relative cost and need for additional funding also increases. So, in the interest of 'good business,' corporations strike up deals with candidates, exchanging campaign support for the politician's favorable consideration when it matters most to the 'financier'. And, in order to keep their jobs, they must uphold their end of this once-lucrative bargain, put the interests of corporations above their constituents, and little by little, corruption increasingly becomes the norm for these would-be career politicians. To return to the metaphor, we now have our newspaper, which burns well momentarily, but then needs more to sustain the fire. \n EVEN when money is no longer an issue, corporations still have the means to infect our political bodies with corruption. The crux of it lies in the human condition. By that I'm referring to the reality that nobody is as perfect as their campaign ad would have you believe, and to make it in our political system, it would seem that one must be perfect, or at least MOSTLY perfect. These imperfections can include: a scandal of some sort (be it sexual or ethical in nature), 'otherness' in any sense (race/ethnicity, gender, etc.), or a host of other attributes that can easily be spun by special interest groups as undesirable. And if that doesn't work, they'll dig deeper and find a skeleton in a forgotten closet that can be used for blackmail. With all of that being the case, if politicians don't appease the corporate coals that keep their metaphorical bonfire lit, i.e. sell out to corruption, they'll be targeted, and they'll eventually lose their job. \n The last element of this bonfire is the tendency for a lot of Americans to vote with as little forethought as they can muster, obeying the battery of extreme opinions repeated ad nauseum from their favorite  corporately-owned  media outlet. So trying to fix the system through a grassroots effort probably won't accomplish much. It's like one guy pissing on the wildfire that started with the bonfire (I had to complete the metaphor). There's no clear solution, but the best one I've heard so far comes from Lawrence Lessig and is outlined [here]( \n I've certainly left some factors out, but these are the most glaring ones.": "politics",

            "As much as I agree with your post, it's horribly one-sided. You make it seem as if the digital revolution was all bad, with not discernible benefits. The fact is that music, in all shapes and forms, has been made accessible and digestible in ways previously not even imaginable. \n That's part of the issue right there. We don't need access to all of this music and it's made music a disposable product. Back in the day, I used to line up on Tuesdays to buy the newest vinyl/tape/etc.. and I would rock the shit out of that record / tape / etc because I could not afford a huge library of music. I didn't have an issue with it, and it made me appreciate the music I had so much more. \n Nowadays, most kids have more music than they could ever listen to, and rarely, if ever, spend any time with an album. It has become about immediate gratification and a by-product of that is, we have made the music disposable.. this is not a good thing. I don't care if you have every Pitchfork-approved album from the last 5 years.. how many did you actually listen to and hear as opposed to play for a bit until the next band / artist du jour comes along? \n >Like obscure pop music from south Zambia? Where before you might not be able to find it at all, now it's a click away. Want to listen to music somewhere other than in the same room as your turntable? MP3s, or better yet streaming, allow you to do that easily. Have your own band and want to make yourselves heard across the globe? Forget record contracts and labels, spread your links and people will hear you everywhere. \n You do know that people outside of Zambia were listening to Zambian pop / psych-rock / etc before the internet right? All it did was make it more accessible to people who don't have the dedication to seek it out themselves. If you have to be spoon fed something to appreciate it (by having it posted on blogs, etc) .. it makes it contemptible. And it doesn't allow you to appreciate the music in the same way. I guarantee you that people who sought out original tapes / vinyl of WITCH or any other Zambian group appreciate the hell out of the music more than some kid who downloads it and throws it in the mix with every other album s/he has downloaded that week (which is probably in the 20-30 range at least.. and again, who needs that much music?). \n As far as transportability.. we've always had that.. pre-internet we had it. Tape your records, buy tapes and / or cds .. hell, digitize your records for your mp3 player (or the logical extension, include an mp3 download card with the wax), so I'm not sure that argument is valid whatsoever.. it never stopped previous generations. \n And as for your last statement.. I see that as a double-edged sword. Yes, it's great because that kid or kids making music in their basement, who otherwise would not have a platform to get their music out there, now have the possibility of doing that. However, every other jackass in the world now is a musician, or a producer, or artiste... so it's that much harder to actually find good music now. Just because you CAN do something doesn't mean you SHOULD do it. People need to remember this.. at least in the old setup, we were only exposed to people dedicated to making music as opposed to any asshole who downloads ableton and decides they're a 'producer' now. \n >Record collecting is a physical hobby, in my opinion. Quite like repairing old cars or collecting stamps. The world has moved past the need for music to be tied to physical storage containers, so keeping and collecting said containers is now a hobby instead. \n See.. this is why I absolutely loathe the term \"record collecting\". I don't collect records... I buy music, that happens to be on a vinyl format. Just like I never \"collected\" tapes, or CDs.. it wasn't the actual format I was collecting.. it was the music. A lot of the music I love, never made it past a vinyl pressing.. so I had no other choice but to buy the vinyl if I wanted it. And I think this point is lost on a lot of people who decide to \"collect\" records. \n >I really think we should stop pretending it's a better method of handling music altogether, because it really isn't. When records came about, records were the best way. Now, they're not. Are they still perfectly functional and do they still offer tons of value? Of course they do. \n Again, I completely disagree. Vinyl means you listen to the album as an artist intended. Versus on a shuffled playlist like most end users tend to listen. In a way, it forces you to listen to songs that you might otherwise just skip by on mp3/CD/whatever. And, speaking for myself although I'm sure it applies to others... there are a lot of songs I grew up with that I hated on first listen but became a huge fan of. If I grew up in the digital era, I doubt I ever would have given them a second chance.. and I'm glad I did. So I just have to plainly disagree with your point there - vinyl is the best way to appreciate albums. \n >I love vinyl, but I'm not giving up digital, nor do I think digital is \"worse\" than LPs. I still buy music on iTunes, on Bandcamp, from the artists, as well as pirate it from time to time. I listen to digital music at home, at work or on the go. \n This is the disconnect for me. I understand having digital for being on the go or at work.. but why at home? Why are you even buying records in the first place if you're not going to listen to them at home? Beyond digital-only releases or previewing records I'm thinking of purchasing, when I am at home.. I listen to my wax.. that's why I have it. \n >My records are my hobby, my relaxation, my obsession. \n See... for me, music is my hobby, my relaxation, my obsession. Vinyl just happens to be my preferred format. \n >You know what happened with the digital revolution? Film and music exploded in scope and quantity. Is that stagnation? I certainly don't think so. \n See.. I disagree. To reference my earlier point.. it made a shit tonne of people think they were film makers or musicians, who didn't want to actually devote any time or effort into their craft. It flooded the market with people who thought they could set up a youtube page or a bandcamp and become rock stars overnight. It also made it next to impossible to find the real gems in this tidal wave of mediocrity. That's moving backwards, not forwards, as far as I'm concerned.

A lot of her lyrics deal with feminine empowerment and her last album, 4, was actually fairly musically complex. \n So he compliments her on her lyrics (which aren't her own) and on her music being complex (which she doesn't produce).

Not sure how you didn't get those in your google search. \n Also from a source familiar with it all (which echos a sentiment found throughout the music industry regarding Beyonce): \n \"Matthew [Knowles] has a long history of trying to get songwriters to add Beyonce's name to songs she didn't compose, just so she gets publishing royalties. That information eventually became widely known, and now anyone who wants to accuse Kelly or Destiny's Child of stealing material has ammunition to file a lawsuit. Kelly is livid.\" \n A Sony employee sent out the following email just prior to the release of her Sasha Fierce album: \n A lot of these artists claim to be songwriters, but don\u2019t always write a thing. Some, like Beyonce, serve as vocal arrangements, which points to part of the song\u2019s composition, and thus, receive a songwriting and production credit. Others, like Beyonce, can demand credit based on their name alone. I myself have heard of new song writers looking for placement with Beyonce\u2019s last album being told Beyonce demands a certain amount of publishing upfront (and it\u2019s substantial) or they could \u201cbe paid handsomely\u201d to politely remove their name from the song altogether. Fact is, Beyonce didn\u2019t write one song on \u201cI Am\u2026Sasha Fierce.\u201d Beyonce and her team have bought the rights from the songwriters and then Beyonce took credit for it. I have no idea about previous albums but it\u2019s obvious that Beyonce never had a pen in her hand, which is a shame because Beyonce claims something she isn\u2019t. \n Here is what \"hit\" producer, Bangladesh, had to say about working with Beyonce: \n \u2019ll put it like this: It doesn\u2019t matter who\u2019s writing the songs, or who\u2019s producing the songs. It\u2019s who\u2019s delivering the mother fucker. It really doesn\u2019t matter if Beyonce is actually sitting there physically writing the song. Even if she\u2019s not, it don\u2019t mean she can\u2019t. She might not have the time. It doesn\u2019t matter, because you can work with artists who write, or work with artists that\u2019s Beyonce\u2019s level\u2026 For me\u2026 It doesn\u2019t matter. \n \u201cThe people outside looking in, they wanna know if she writes her own songs or if she ain\u2019t. At the end of the day, she\u2019s on a level where things are handed to her; people wanna be a part of what she\u2019s doing. She either wrote it, or she can put her name on it \u2013 it doesn\u2019t matter because that\u2019s the boss you are.\u201d \n And that was all from a quick 5 minute google.

            "Well I wouldn't say you are stupid.  Bullying is a serious issue, and a complex one at that.  Looking at it from many angles is a good idea.  Certainly parents should be more involved.  But, the difficult thing with that is that no parent wants to believe their child is a bully.  Along with many parents who really don't give a shit, or are absent.  So the school does need to be involved.  I mean if I ran an ice cream shop and saw a kid bullying another kid in my shop, I would put a stop to it.  School should be doing the same thing. \n Parents should be doing more, I do believe this.  But there is only so much they can do.  A lot of bullying, if played out by adults, would be classified as (sometimes sexual) harassment and/or assault.  I would say the school is responsible for policing activities that occur on their property. \n So the responsibility lies with both parents and schools, but schools are functioned by the government where they can actually have a say in what happens.  The government can't force parents to punish their children at home, but they can punish them in the schools. \n What we should be doing is creating an environment were bullying is unacceptable, as viewed by other students.  That is, if one student is bullying another, the rest of the students will stop it from happening.  That they should also be held responsible for not acting when they see something they know is wrong.  I do think the current anti-bullying media coverage is helping with this. \n As for the parents of bullied kids, they usually are doing just about everything imaginable to help their child, and do not deserve any blame for what happens to them while at school.

While boarding, the stewards informed us that the initial problem with the plane was not a serious error, but rather an aesthetic one.  We could have easily flown without making the repair.  To top it off, I spent the next hour and a half with about fifteen children, at least ten of which were under five years old. I was supposed to land in Victoria at noon, and landed at 2:30.

            "Tonight I was longboarding home from a friends house. Near my house, there's a schoolyard with no path cutting through, so I had to carry my board across the field. A group of guys who were clearly drunk off their asses were in the playground and started yelling at me to see my longboard. I had headphones in so I pretended not to notice them even though nothing was playing. I turned a cold shoulder and looked away until I approached the path. I started boarding to my house when I heard their voices yelling distinctly louder. I turned back and saw that they were running through the field towards me, still asking to see my board. I knew that running at that point would make it worse so I acknowledged them with a \"What?\" even though I knew exactly what was about to happen. They surrounded me, and started asking about it. Their ringleader suddenly said \"Wait a minute I know this kid! He lives across the street from me.\" Turns out it's my fucking scumbag drug dealer neighbor. Internally I was freaking out, but I tried to be friendly and calm towards him. One of his friends kept asking to see my board, and I realized I was totally vulnerable just standing on it, so I got off and picked it up with the hand far from him. My neighbor said to him \"No, we aren't going to jack him.\" but he kept insisting. My neighbor said again \"No no we aren't going to jack him, he's cool, he lives across the street from me.\" The third one standing by my neighbor echoed the sentiment, so I felt relieved until my neighbor said \"Hey your fucking mom called the cops on us for blazing once.\" At that point my stomach lept out of my throat. Immediately I tried to clear my name by saying \"Well that's shitty, but I don't think my mom would do that. She doesn't like to get involved in that sort of thing, so it was probably someone else.\" I waited in fear for his response. He replied \"You know what? I bet it was those fucking neighbors of yours. I swear to fucking god...\" I counter with \"Yeah I can't speak on anyone else's behalf but it definitely wasn't my mom.\" Of course I was desperate to clear our names. The guy on my left asked to see the board again and my neighbor yelled at him \"I told you man, we aren't fucking jacking him! He's cool.\" They offered me a blunt and a drink, but I denied both. They were into far heavier drugs (these people are like Badger and Skinny P from Breaking Bad) and it could easily have been laced. They kept insisting but I got on my board, thanked them, and started riding away. As soon as I was out of sight an adrenaline rush hit me and I bolted home. I weigh 145 pounds, so these guys had the power to seriously fuck me up, stealing my backpack, my board, and everything in my pockets. They almost certainly would have had I not known them. I live in a city with a very low crime rate (aside from recreational drug use), so I was not at all prepared for it, and it definitely freaked me the hell out.

            "My 3 year old daughter has been melting down at daycare almost everyday over the last few weeks, seemingly over nothing. \n We went to the doctor about it because it's been such an intense couple of weeks for her, we wanted to make sure there wasn't anything else wrong that might cause pain or discomfort that she isn't able to localize. \n Not to go into to long of a story, but this began right after her mother stayed overnight at the hospital for observation concerning migraines/seizures (she's fine), then my grandmother died (we were very close), then I found out that my psychiatrist (who I am close with, trust, and is wonderful in every way) is moving. It was an intense week for Mom and Dad, and she loved her great grandma very much. \n I am sure it was very jarring for her to have to leave her Mom at the hospital and learning that her great grandmother isn't coming back, etc. Her pediatrician told us that no matter what age, kids are never \"too young to understand what's going on\" and that he's sure she has been able to pick up on our stress and the situation at hand. \n Anyway, we ruled out any physical illnesses (we also talked to my therapist, who said that sensitivity might be a developmental thing and that sometimes kids obtain an unhealthy level of empathy during this). Her mother and I are both treated for mental illnesses (OCD and Bipolar Disorder, respectively), so stress begets anxiety and it's very taxing for us, let alone how taxing it is for her. \n God I feel like I am rambling. \n Moving on, we have been focusing on positivity, having fun, and getting lots of sleep. Drinking lots of water and ruling out unhealthy snacks (we took some cookies to daycare today [it's a Montessori daycare with only a couple if other kids her age], but it didn't help lighten her mood at all) are also on the list of things. \n Let's break there. Ok, health is being considered. \n The other big thing that seems to be going on is this other girl at school. She is 4 and has a severe speech delay. My daughter has quite an astonishing speech advancement, in comparison, and according to their teacher, this really frustrates this other girl. My daughter will come home saying that this girl is saying mean things, pulling her hair, \"pewing\" her (pew pew, playing \"bad guys\" that shoot at each other), etc. Her teacher keeps an eye on them, and she says that it's lighthearted and non-hostile, but my daughter's sensitivity interprets these as \"mean things\". She is extremely sensitive to being left out, and will almost go into self-exile when they want to play a game that she doesn't. Like I said, it's only like 3 older kids (3-4 yo) and a couple of younger kids (nb - 2 yo). \n I was also a sensitive kid. Very empathetic and emotionally fragile. Though, I grew up in a high-stress environment, so I don't know. My mom used to cry because I didn't have any friends when I was very young. I used to poke fun at her because of it (as an adult), but now I am very, very afraid that my daughter might be experiencing the same thing.": "daddit",
            "I am going to link something I wrote from another thread about this: \n > I have known many, many guys who get in bands, get some fans, get really excited about touring, and a couple years later, they are burned out and holding on for a record deal. The burn out period takes a toll and a lot of guys learn that they are not the chipper youth group kids they once were. \n > It's a job, and a lot of people don't realize it. I play with a ton of great musicians and a number of them have been in acts playing at the top level of the industry on secular labels, etc. All are good people, and most of them are really chilled out people who have moved out of the industry and are now moms and dads (myself included). \n > Unfortunately, once a band is labeled as a Christian band, it's a tough market to get out of. Like ASID, there is an image to maintain and losing that image might be a big deal. Same with Underoath. They received a lot of backlash when they learned that the Christianity aspect of their music had become blurry to them. \n > It's a tough, tough job. From the bottom level, to the absolute top level. \n > That being said, I just hung out with a nationally touring Christian hardcore act (my guitar player used to play for them), and they are all 100% normal people. What you see is what you get. They might get up and say \"Hey we believe in Jesus and we think he loves you\", but there isn't a fake prayer session or a 5 min speech in the middle of the set. They are a band, they make records, they make money, and they happen to be Christian. We also hit up an empty bar afterwards, and had a great time. Good friends who love Jesus and try to show that to people with their music. Pretty simple. \n > Another guy who I played with a while back is a touring guitarist for an internationally touring Christian worship artist. Same type of deal, but it get reaaaaally complicated with the job vs. ministry thing. Tons of money is rolling in, and making sense of that is difficult sometimes. It's disconcerting. How many \"ministries\" make millions of dollars every year? Not that many. The simple concepts get blurred lines drawn all over them very fast. And working with a label that is going to help you make all that money is looking to get paid, plain and simple. A \"Christian record label\" (I'm looking at you Tooth & Nail) is not a charity. They exist to make money by signing popular bands. \n > Third example, I am friends with a huge band that just signed to a huge label and is currently headlining a huge tour. They are fine. Once again, it's clear cut. They play, they make money, they make records, and they show you what they believe in with their music. Totally grounded guys. \n > I think the hardest part of the industry is mixing good intentions with the whole ministry vs. job type of thing. At least with the pro music environment. It's really, really hard to do. Not the talent aspect, but the emotional, ego aspect. It takes a toll on you. \n > I knew one more dude, a big name Christian contemporary artist, very talented. I played soccer with him on a church team and had no idea who he was (not my style of music), until one day someone told me. I knew he was going through a rough divorce and he was having a hard time with it. He proceeded to drop off the face of the earth. It was way too much and he hated being fake in front of people. Nice guy, and I hope he is doing alright. \n > Annnnnyyywayyyy, the moral of the story is: it's much, much harder than you might think to be in a \"Christian band\". Life gets really shitty, and it's not like being a worship leader where maybe you can step down when you know you're being fake and aren't in a capacity to lead. It's your livelihood and you might not have other skills to fall back on. The Christian music industry is white, shining, squeaky clean, but the people playing in bands are dirty, dirty sinners that need Jesus. No one is perfect and the face you see on stage is sometimes not totally honest. Hopefully people can be honest and still sing and do their jobs and sing about who Christ is, but please know that it's really, really hard. \n > One quick edit: The first time I heard of a band faking it to sell records was in high school. I was playing with a few people I had just sort of met, and one had a brother is a regional band that was getting some play. He was really concerned and didn't know what to think. I couldn't wrap my head around it. They weren't faking it, they were plain old lying. Now, I can see how easily anyone could do that, including myself. It sucks. No one is impervious to sin. No matter how good the lyrics are or how \"powerful\" the message is. \n > If you're not cool with a band for whatever reason, don't buy the records and don't go to shows. But understand that not everyone is putting a hit out on their wife or struggling with their mental state like Lambesis. Just like anyone else, these guys and girls have real life problems like anyone else. Some bands recognize that, and some can't handle it. \n Lambesis made many, many choices that were not, not good. No one is denying that. But, I don't think a lot of people get how difficult it is to be in a band for a living.  Every single person you work with/around is making money off of you in some way.  That is complicated, and when you're 19 and you \"want to make music for Jesus\", you become shell shocked. \n Lambesis is right about one important thing: a band like this is 100% a business. It's a job. There are people who are \"in the band\" (ie the people on the contract) and there are people who just tour with you. It is a money making venture, just the same as my job or a job at McD's. Sure, you get to make art and talk about Jesus, but so does the Christian plumber. In his own way, at least. \n People know it's something that is so close to your sense of self that it's deplorable to lie about it. But, I think what people don't realize is that when you make that part of your identity, it's harder to keep that part of you intact. \n All of the people I mentioned above are Christians, they are in bands, and they do bad shit just like anyone else (hardcore bands know how to party, which is why they are my favorite). These guys are just like anybody, and sometimes it's hard for them to maintain the image. When you change as a person, and you have no other skills to speak of, how are you just supposed to just toss it away and get another job? For some people, it's extremely hard. \n edit:": "Music",

He had a couple of bites, but one guys said \"No thanks, it's got two serial numbers.\" To (mostly) his amazement, there is an inked serial number on the back of the headstock  and  a stamped serial number \"underneath\" it. That scared some dudes away, and he has been trying to sell it for a few weeks since then. \n Anyway, after a number of offers that fell through, he decided to email Gibson to figure it all out. Lo and behold, Jon Sutherland from Gibson replied and basically told him that the inked serial number is good and he should have no doubts about the authenticity of the guitar. Gibson themselves told him it's good to go. 100% real. \n Jon also said that they have no idea what the stamped serial number might be. They left it at that. \n This just happened a few minutes ago, so he is probably going to take that back to one of the offers and try to reestablish some terms. \n The question remains: why does this guitar still have stamped serial number? The number doesn't line up with what the guitar/inked serial number says it is. \n The most I could find on the internet was that some Classics post-2005 were stamped, and some Classics were inked. \n Manufacturing mistake?

            "so even if i cant really hear the difference myself standing in front on my amp on stage, is it something that a sound guy would appreciate and would i sit better in the mix itself? \n Definitely. He can compress himself, but a better (or smoother) signal going into the mic can only make your guitar easier to mix. \n > a properly set compressor negates this factor \n This is where you're missing the mark. A \"properly\" (it really depends on the instrument and the musician) set compressor can still retain dynamics while also smoothing out what you're playing. It really just depends. \n But, in the compressor pedal market, things have been changing. Some boutique companies are putting studio grade comps in these pedals and have all of the options available to you. Empress and Walrus have comps that I have been on my wishlist. What makes them different? They both include (and I sure other companies have boxes like this) a \"mix\" knob. \n The mix knob lets you blend the compressed signal and your dry signal for a more subtle effect. This is called parallel compression in an engineering environment. Check out some demo videos. \n And the Empress pedal has a \"side chain\" jack. This lets you put another 1/4\" input into the pedal to employ \"side chain compression\". The best example is with a bass going through the pedal. For a good live mix, some people like to get the bass to \"duck out\" from the mix when the kick drum gets hit. This can clean up and \"lock in\" the low end of a mix really well. One application would be getting a split from the kick mic to the compressor on the bass pedal board. Every time the kick gets hit, it subtly \"ducks\" some bass out of the mix which can have a great effect out front.": "guitarpedals",

Commas, periods, colons, etc. are all there to help you better understand what it written. \n Punctuation developed alongside literacy, if I am correct. Ancient Greek, particularly New Testament, manuscripts are great examples. Originally, the Greek texts were composed as a wall of texts, sometimes in two or three columns across the page. Also, there is no spacing between the letters. This makes it difficult to read New Testament manuscripts, as everything must be read with respect to context. As the church grew, texts were copied, and literacy became more widespread, they inserted verse numbers for reference and punctuation as to create a better understanding of what was being said. \n Here is an example of a Greek manuscript with annotations: \n In red, people added things to the existing text to help others understand what was going on.": "explainlikeimfive"

Divestment would be when our university stops investing in these companies in order to remain neutral in the conflict. \n As it stands, the UN has found the Israeli military guilty of many human rights abuses against the Palestinian people, and these companies directly aid the Israeli military. This makes these companies accessories to human rights abuses. Many argue that the continuation of investment into these companies demonstrates a complacency in human rights abuses on SDSU's part, and to profit of that would be immoral. \n I will admit that I am biased towards the argument I just explained above. However the other side of the argument is also very worth considering. If we were to stop investing in companies that are indirectly responsible for the perpetration of human rights abuses, that would mean we would have to look into all the companies SDSU invests in, and probably not invest in many of them because most large companies commit (or are accessory) to human rights abuses somewhere. Hell, most of the shit we do in our consumer lifestyle is accessory to a human rights abuse somewhere in the world somehow. Plus, many of these companies would be less willing to hire SDSU graduates if our school basically gives them the finger and stops investing.

Honestly, until there is an hour and a half empty gap after Phoenix when the set times come out, shut the fuck up about Daft Punk at Coachella. If they were going to play in 2013, they'd be on the poster.": "Coachella",
            "Have you ever actually attended Coachella because from your argument I would assume not.  Kendrick Lamar WAS on the lineup. And Rihanna is in the crowd every year, everyone expects her to guest with anyone who she's worked with during the weekend. It was to no one\u2019s real surprise that she came out with Calvin Harris after everyone saw her dancing around at M83. Usually guests are somehow related to the artist in some major way. Significant others, ACTUAL collaborators who live in LA, bands who are touring with each other, etc. Dr. Dre was definitely an exception, I'll give you that. But for him it made total sense to have a large stream of guests because in reality he's not as much a rapper as a producer. So his performance was geared around showcasing his producing and, more importantly, he actually has songs with all those artists that showed up. Phoenix on the other hand does not actually feature Daft Punk on a single song. You are basing Daft Punk showing up on a single one off, special guest appearance from 3 years ago. Why was that so special? Because no one saw it coming. They have no common songs, so for them to do it again would be completely contrived and go against the entire Daft Punk ethos. When was the last time Daft Punk did something expected of them? They don't even announce albums in a traditional fashion. \n I know this is a shock to most but Phoenix are actually their own band, not Daft Punk's lackeys. They made it to a Coachella headlining slot based on their own popularity. Why, in the biggest moment of their careers, are they going to just say, \"fuck it\" and invalidate not only their set but everything they've worked for during their careers to make a few Daft Punk fans happy.  The notion that they are going to play for at least an hour and half but then for some reason have everyone forget their entire by bringing out Daft Punk for 10 minutes is so ridiculous to me. Headlining Coachella is a big deal and it\u2019s your chance in the spotlight, I don\u2019t get why everyone assumes they want to just hand that over to Daft Punk because they did it once 3 years ago as an up and coming indie band. They made it, they don\u2019t need Daft Punk to validate their performance anymore. You think if they do bring out DP that anyone will be talking about Phoenix? No, they will be talking about Daft Punk. Phoenix\u2019s set will be a forgotton footnote when remembering the weekend. \n And honestly, as a Daft Punk fan are you really that set on 2 songs with Phoenix? 6 years after their last tour and 8 since their last album and you\u2019d be satisfied with a 1901/Around the World mashup? I don\u2019t get why people want this so bad. Yes, it would be cool to see Daft Punk but I want to see them rock the shit for 2 hours, not come out for 2 measly mashed up Phoenix songs. I would expect most Daft Punk fans to feel the same. \n In regards to addressing rumors, Coachella is always surrounded by rumors. David Bowie and the Talking Heads every year. Dre Dre coming out during Jay-Z in 2010. Everyone and their mother for Kanye in 2011. David Bowie has an album out and is markedly bigger than Daft Punk, do they need to address rumors of him playing? A festival that spent countless hours and millions of dollars on 170 artists should not have to address rumors about the artists that aren't even on the bill. Oh wait they did address it by ANNOUNCING THE LINEUP WITHOUT DAFT PUNK. You yourself say they don't need to address \u201cevery\u201d rumor, so what makes Daft Punk so special? Why is a songkick generated rumor so \"significant\" as you put it , that it needs addressing? Just because Daft Punk is your favorite band and has an album coming out does not make them have some special priority over other rumors. Lou Reed (a legend who was actually on the bill) just cancelled his performance and Coachella didn't even address that. I've heard some ridiculous names thrown around as his replacement, like David Byrne, who is bigger to some than Daft Punk. Does that mean they have to come out and deny that as well? You make the case that they shouldn\u2019t address every rumor and you\u2019re right. However, Daft Punk is not an exception because YOU PERSONALLY deem them more important. \nAnd really Coachella didn't need to address the Vevo rumor for a very simple reason: Everyone with half a brain knows that it was generated by SongKick and was total bullshit. I can go make a Songkick for the Beatles playing Coachella right now, it doesn\u2019t mean anything. Coachella is much more worried about promoting the 170+ bands that are actually on the bill than debunking rumors for ignorant Daft Punk fans who can\u2019t cope with the next few months until they tour. \n As far as artists playing shows without an album released you  are totally right. Except all those artists have announced tours behind said album before their performances. Not to mention singles. And in most cases their albums leak extremely early. Bankrupt! for example has been available for almost a month now. Daft Punk playing before they release RAM is so incredibly different than Phoenix or any other band who plays before their album is released. You can\u2019t compare releasing your new material mid tour when you have 20 upcoming dates announced to a band who has still not publically said a word other than releasing a date for their album. \n And why does it matter how Pitchfork addressed the rumor?  Please feel free to explain the difference between \"Daft Punk's camp\" and a \"Daft Punk representative\". Because representative sounds more official? The fact they felt confident to publish the story should have been enough, regardless of the wording used. And just because the jokers over at NME and Rolling Stone jumped on the story too doesn\u2019t mean Pitchfork is right. Not to say Pitchfork is wrong (they aren\u2019t) but how does other news outlets copying their story give it more credence? 5 hours earlier Rolling Stone was pumping the Vevo rumor just like every other idiot on the internet.": "DaftPunk",
            "The director analogy people are using is perfect. Adding to to the metaphor is his ability to pull amazing performances from not only big names but up and coming and unknown artists. Take Yeezus for example. Kanye is able to juxtapose and  mesh work from huge names like Mike Dean and Daft Punk, and mix it with the unique sounds of up comers like TNGHT, Gesaffelstein and Arca. He's also able to get things that seem out of character from people. On Yeezus he has Chief Keef, the face of Chicago Drill, singing longingly about alcoholism. People downplay this aspect of his music but its probably his most amazing skill and what makes him so unique. \n I also don't think he gets enough credit for constantly changing his sound. Most hip hop artists find their niche and work within it. He could easily just kept making heartfelt soul sample raps his whole career and been extremely successful. But he's never satisfied and always pushing the envelope. Its no easy task to keep finding hot new producers and rappers to work with yet album after album he proves he has a gift.": "LetsTalkMusic",
            "It depends if you are running a calorie deficit or not. As someone who counts calories I find BCAA's crucial for recovery and preventing muscle fatigue when working out. Without them I start to breakdown if I push it too hard in the gym and it starts to affect my sessions. I consider them my most indispensable supplement (and I take quite a few). If you're not on a diet and can eat as much protein as you want the recovery and fatigue benefits will probably be less noticeable though. When you can only get so much protein in a day due to restrictions getting an extra boost from BCAAs helps a lot more than just tossing them on top of a diet with sufficient protein intake. \n In the end it really just becomes an an issue of cost. You can definitely take them and they'll still be at least somewhat effective but you can easily obtain the same BCAAs from other sources.  A scoop of protein powder contains about the same as a serving of BCAA powder as do most 4oz servings of animal proteins.  A few week supply of BCAAs is $20-$30 which is why people usually advise just adding an extra scoop of protein powder or eating an extra piece of chicken if you want more BCAAs. If you can't add the extra calories then that's when the powder becomes necessary.": "Supplements",

Their music is the most simple and dumbed down version of the genre, designed for mass radio consumption.

            "I hate to burst your bubble but you're wrong on so many levels. First, they already told Coachella no. Do you see their name on the poster? No, because they aren't playing and that's what they told Coachella months ago. Coachella already announced this fact on January 24th when they dropped their lineup. Why would they address this again? If Coachella addressed every rumor regarding who was playing Paul Tollett would be a professional press conference holder. \n Second, while Pitchfork has many, many faults, when it comes to Daft Punk they don't mess around (unlike Rolling Stone and every blog ever). They were the [first ones to sniff out the Renoma Street nonsense]( and they only post Daft related stuff with sources. While I agree its shady they only refer to them as \"Daft Punk's camp\", they wouldn't post the article unless they had good reason as they have never been in the business of posting lies about Daft Punk for web traffic. Obviously someone at Pitchfork has some in with DP because I have yet to see them be wrong when debunking Daft rumors. \n And finally why should a band have to address every rumor that comes out about it? Some groups don't want to be Deadmau5 and livestream their entire lives/careers. The reason they wont address this head on is because its insane. The whole Coachella nonsense is based on a Songkick date which can be edited by anyone. Did no one learn from the Rolling Stones/Coachella debacle? And I'm not even going to address the Phoenix BS. Daft Punk are secretive and elusive, it's one of the things that makes them so appealing. They don't have any obligation to you or anyone for that matter. They don't do social media, its just part of their whole mystique. If it really bothers you that much there are plenty of bands that love social media you can follow that will tweet and FB your heart content. \n The only thing you said that I'd normally agree with is that nothing is official unless it comes from Daft Punk themselves but in this case the old adage \"absence of evidence is not evidence of absence\" really rings true. Just because Daft Punk doesn't come out and debunk ridiculous rumors (really people? a live date after a 6 year hiatus with no new material released?) doesn't mean they are going to play live. Why address the rumors when they continually fuel the perpetual hype machine that is Daft Punk? They haven't even released their new album and are already by far the most talked about band of 2013. I'd assume most the people in this subreddit are smart enough to cut through the jackassery of the rest of the internet and be unbothered by the fact they don't address idiocy head on because if you actually follow them its pretty easy to tell when information is true or false.": "DaftPunk"

            "Great post.  I'd like to share my production story now. \n I've been at electronic music for 5 years now and 2 years before attempting to record my band.  I always thought it was going to be an easy process before I started.   Just get a microphone and put it up to something right?  Fucking wrong. \n I slowly started to learn keywords and understand that this was no short process.  I had spent countless hours trying to get my music to sound like the music I listened to but no dice.  As I worked harder and harder I came to realize there's certain parts I had to perfect to get some results. \n The first problem I encountered was the loudness of my music.  Why was it so much quieter than commercial music?  How do people get it so loud without clipping?  I had to find out.  I then learned about headroom and frequencies because before this point I thought an EQ was optional.  While learning about these two things I was also becoming proficient in Ableton Live (a switch from pro tools).  Maybe a year later I was finally accustomed to these things but my music sounded crappy.  How did artists make their drum kits so good? \n That brings the second problem I had, sound design.  I remember messaging Revolvr before he was a big deal and he responded with vengeance.  I got a ton of vengeance samples and it completely changed my world.  I was stunned by how good the samples were.  But they weren't good enough.  They still sounded pretty bad to me so I took to layering and melding samples together.  Another  year passed and my music was getting better as I moved on the \"mastery curve\".  Now my problem wasn't with the drums but my synthesis.  Honestly my synthesis sucked. \n That was the third problem.  My synthesis was far too basic.  I started working with as many different VST's as I could.  Massive, sylenth1, Z3ta+, fm8, absynth, and loads of freeware synths in the mix of things.  I learned the different types of synthesis and what each does to make it different from the others.  Now that I had all of this down the problem was that my music hurt my ears. \n Here's where I learned to mix properly and design my sounds to \"soften\" them and create a pleasurable sound.  I look to deadmau5 often for this sort of thing.  He tends to put out sounds that are so intriguing and they sound phenomenal.   It was at this point where I realized that my studio monitors were much better for production than my $200 computer monitors.  Getting rid of a sub can work wonders.  I used to think you needed I crank the bass to 11 but then I realized headroom would suffer and I couldn't make my music loud thus putting the puzzle pieces together much like this write up states. \n Today I feel as though my music could be better but it's getting to a level where I'd feel comfortable releasing it onto labels.  I've been producing stock audio for reality companies for awhile now and I'm proud of what I do today.  I've had plenty of let downs where I spend A TON of time on a track and I get disappointed with the end result.  It happens a shit ton guys.

Yes we are having an argument and you're clearly distraught by what I have to say. \n [Here's BT's article on Porter Robinson, you might find it interesting to know who we're talking about first]( You say Porter doesn't think he's above everybody else but his character says otherwise.   No one says \"I don't have time to finish our collabs\" to an established producer like BT unless you think you're god himself or you're an ignorant EDM child. \n Porter says he wants to step away from creating his old music which is completely fine to do, but instead of crying like a bitch on twitter maybe he could show us instead.  This week that's exactly what he did (after he whined and bawled his eyes out). \n Now, the music he has put out this week is not something that needs to take 2 years to complete.  By no means was it anything special from a production standpoint.  Thanks 4 the w8, bro.  Appreciate the killer tune /s. \n Next, Mr. Robinson seems to be VERY upset that his fans (fans were hooked onto him from his electro music) keep telling him to make his old music.  That is completely normal of fans.  I'm sure even you've said the words \"I liked his/their/her old stuff more\".  Shit happens.  Porter is no different than any other artist. \n Now I'd like to talk about his \"anxiety attacks\".

You don't have to be rude about this, it's my opinion and I'm entitled to it just as much as you're entitled to liking Porter Robinson.   We disagree, it happens.

The way I see it there's two sides of the hype spectrum, the side that enjoys music such as M-83 (which is totally fine, do what you do) and the side that loves Porter because everyone else loves porter.  I don't see much in between since postrock was never like Porter and Language was never like postrock.

            "Sorry I couldn't listen to the clips (on my phone) but what you're experiencing isn't abnormal and I think I can help. Lots of basra sounds will vary in perceived loudness for a variety of reasons. First and foremost has to do with the notes being played, as you have already identified. If you play a C1, which is about 32.7 Hz, you're going to have an extremely low bass that you feel more than hear. This is because the frequency of the waves take much longer to actualize and therefore their energy, or perceived loudness,  is much less. Play the same note an octave higher and you'll be at about 65.4 Hz, which will inherently sound louder. Another big factor is your monitors/headphones. They're all designed differently and naturally accentuate certain frequencies over others. This is why it's crucial to know your listening environment and speakers INTIMATELY, because addressing these kinds of bass level issues are severely important and you need to know that you're making the best choices possible depending on what you're hearing. \n The best way to handle this issue, IMHO, is volume automation. Bass levels are extremely important to the overall dynamics of a track and if your bass lines have a large range (as in your playing many notes that span the octave) you don't want to leave the job to a compressor. I like to make my grid the size of my midi notes (ableton) and make envelope boosts or cuts as needed to get the bassline roughly equal in volume. Maybe then some subtle compression to smooth it out even more. \n So yea, the": "edmproduction",
            "So here's the story...I'm a composer and producer who happens to be obsessed with filmmaking.  In the process of expanding my portfolio I realized I did not simply want to strip audio from existing movies and compose over them again so I set out to film a short sequence that I could simply film, edit, compose for and do sound design.  Call me crazy but I think learning the ins and outs of the filmmaking process can only help a composer understand how to treat each scene or each movie. \n So it's a humble little scene I shot at my friends beach house at night.  I shot on a Canon 60D with a 50mm f/1.2 and a Canon EF-S 10-22mm f/3.5-4.5.  The lighting I had to work with was literally house lights/lamps and some working lights from Loews with foam screens.  So, amateur at best....but here's the thing.  Being an avid composer and sound designer, I know the power that good audio has on even a shitty image.  I plan on doing all audio post, foley and some ADR breathing and such (there is no dialogue) and finally the music, so in reality, the images themselves do not have to be like Spielberg-esque....this is really a platform by which I can set the mood with music and sound effects/design. \n So what I really want to know is, what is the best way to go about editing and correcting my footage to get a rough cut.  I have over an hours worth of shots on my hard drive that I already converted, individually, to AIC format for editing.  I'm working Adobe CS5 (yes I literally downloaded the 30 day trial to put this scene together...i hope it lets me save)  I'm looking at basic editing tuts on Premiere right now but if anyone can offer advice in this realm I would greatly appreciate it.  Should I edit first to get the sequence mapped out and then do color correction? How can I make a relatively poorly lit scene look at least decent (believe me, i'm a music producer so i understand the meaning behing \"garbage in, garbage out\" i'm looking for just good here, not amazing)?

It's a tricky thing to do well and if you haven't gotten to a place where you already understand the fundamentals of the technique and how to properly apply it in different musical contexts, then it can be hard to sort through all the different ideas/tricks people suggest you use. \n Deadmau5 is simply saying that was works best is having the most possible control, with a compressor on each track vs a bus.

            "This is the key, resampling.  My musical style isn't as complex as theirs, i'm working towards it though but in essence there is no lock and cut way to make these tracks.  Some things are far more common than others and I think they're worth paying attention to. \n 1) Resampling: I don't care who you are, if you can plot out every MIDI note of the bassline and get it to flow the way PR and Skrillex do, my hats off to you.  Being good with MIDI is paramount, but a lot of the times, the puzzling together of these various bass sounds is much easier (and only possible, unless you working on a Quad-Core type machine that can handle track after track of midi instruments with tons of processing going on, in real time) using resampled audio.  Whether it's a sampler or just dropping clips back into your arranger, the tightness of interlocking bass/lead riffs is much more attainable working with bits of audio (given that you've taken effort to make various sounds that still work well when placed in the same phrase) \n 2.) Be good at MIDI:  IMHO there may be a few guys out there who can just sample bits of bass tones here and there and formulate a complex, exciting bass line out of it.  But with every track I hear, I can tell that at least some big parts had to be done in MIDI, and knowing how to write basslines with MIDI data is an art unto itself.  Know what octaves work with what sounds, if you dial up a patch and it sounds piercing and tinny, drop it down an octave or two and see if it has the right kind of fatness.  Everyone, in any DAW, should know how to dial in expression, velocity, pitchbend, and a few others but these are the biggies.  Nearly every electro/dubstep type track has cool pitchbends going on.  If you do not know how to achieve this in your DAW/sequencer/synth....you're already failing.  Length of your MIDI notes is C-R-U-C-I-A-L.  Sometimes a bass riff plotted out with MIDI sounds like shit, maybe from clashing with the kick.  Remove the quantize so you can shorten your MIDI notes as big or small as you need and see how even subtle differences can take a lifeless riff and generate the proper groove, swing, and impact of the bassnotes. \n 3.) Automation:  Most of us are on computers and using plug ins....that shit was built for automation.  If you do not know how to instantly set up automation mapping for any parameter on any synth you're using (that supports automation editing), then once again you are missing the picture.  Filter cutoff, amp envelope, pitch, detune, portamento, modulation on just about ANYTHING....these things need to be tweaked to bring your bassline to life.  Whether it's straight up dupstep wobbles from the filter or electro basses with crazy glides in between notes....this genre just calls for excessive levels of parameter automation.  I promise you that is where Porter and Skrillex are spending 90% of their time.  You throw some drums together, plot out some MIDI notes for a bass riff, and then you start automating all the crazy little things you can.  Learn how to draw funky automation curves that are locked to a beat, and that are totally freeform. \n Like I said, everyone has a different setup, different workflow and consequently, different results.  But when it comes to dance music, and especially this style of high energy bass EDM/electro/dubstep, what have you....the 3 things I mentioned seem to be not only the most important to address in your tracks, but also the hardest to fully understand AND utilize to make something that's more than just noise.  Say what you want about the aesthetics of Skrillex's music, or Porter Robinson's music, but these guys are capable of building in a level of complexity into their music that is truly UNPRECEDENTED.  And they're able to do it, more often than not, on laptops with only a few plug ins and shitting producing environment.  The skill is truly in the detail, and they absolutely excel at it.  Hope this helps : P": "abletonlive",
            "This is not true.  This is actually one of the biggest pieces of misinformation I hear tossed around.  A lot of what makes your mix come together, ESPECIALLY considering dance music (I really need to stress this because it's commonly accepted that your master is going to be compressed and limited either a bit or fairly aggressively) is the fact that you are constructing a mix that is going to be squashed.  Knowing this well, especially when you're making mixing decisions, hugely impact the way in which you set your level structure.  If you have your kick and bass sitting PERFECT, with no master-level compression (you're probably just turning up your speaker output to match volume of commercial tracks) then when you strap that limiter/compressor on, your going to see just what it does to the combination of your sounds.  What does this mean for the mixing stage? You have to sort of build a space that your big bass/lead sounds inhabit with a perfect relationship to your kick, which is going to hit hard and probably require the most headroom in your mix (bass frequencies are the first thing that ruin your mix when it comes to limiting.)  The best masters have mixes where the kick/bass relationship are constructed in a way so that when they get squashed together, the end result is the balance and punch you want. \n This is really reserved for heavy-limited dance music, and obviously each mix will have it's own character.  Some tracks have a dominant kick drum, others (like dubstep) require a prominent bass.  And knowing how a master compressor/limiter will affect the dynamics of your track will help you setup your mix with a balance that works when it's pushed hard. This is why I always leave a limiter on my master bus WHILE MIXING so I can check how the balance will sound with a good 3-4db gain reduction.  A really good mastering engineer can compress and limit a mix well if they have the right skills/tools, but proving a mix that is INTENDED to be compressed is a different beast than just making sure everything is perfectly good with nothing on the bus. \n Now if you like your tracks to be punchier at the expensive of not being as loud as most other commercial EDM tracks out there, then please disregard everything I just said as these principles don't really apply.  In that scenario, i'd say it's more crucial to have a perfect mix with little to no master treatment.  If you want your master to be pushed and louder-than-loud, you need/should mix \"into\" a limiter.": "edmproduction",

This is important because I want the video stream to be high quality as well, I'm looking into Logitech webcams (sound is obviously not an issue) but i'm going to need one that does well in low light.

Even though I do agree producers shouldn't copy to make their own material, I will stress that for the vast majority of those producers on this site who are still learning/struggling/evolving....COPYING IS CRUCIAL TO MASTERING YOUR SKILL AND FORM YOUR OWN IDENTITY! \n I think what you were saying was more along the lines of \"don't copy other peoples sound so you can make something fairly similar without feeling the need to make it your own\".  But as a struggling producer I have learned that, in the privacy of my own studio, I tend to try and copy certain sounds from tracks I hear as a TOOL to learn to make something my own.  It's akin to people shouting about staying away from presets at all costs when the reality is a lot of presets can be perfect for your mix, and more so they are perfect ways of not only learning how your synth operates (so you can build your own presets) but of find starting points for your music.

I was never an \"athlete\", but did do quite a bit of working out back when I was in my late teens/early 20s.  I was in good shape up until I started working, and then all exercise stopped.  No lifting, no cardio.  I quickly became skinny-fat, and at 150 lbs, I looked doughy and dumpy. \n Once I hit my 30s, I went from skinny-fat to just plain  fat .  My weight went up to 205 lbs.  Every few years I would get a gym membership and dabble at cardio and lifting, but there was never a plan, and it never lasted more than a few weeks.  Lots of fuckarounditis and excuses.  Many of my relatives are grossly overweight and I was turning into one of them. \n In 2002, I started a new job and on my first day of work, while walking to the office on a hot day, I had to stop half way because I was out of breath and my legs were cramping.  It was really pathetic - here I was in my mid-30s and  I couldn't walk a mile without stopping .  How the hell was I going to play with my kids when they got older?  What kind of example was I setting?  In that moment, I decided to change my life. \n I joined a gym near my office and started working out with a trainer.  He wasn't the best trainer in the world, and he spouted lots of broscience, but he was an excellent motivator.  I was lifting with him 3 days a week, and doing elliptical 2 days a week, and my weight dropped to 175 over a period of a year (helped along by doing low-carb).  My bench went from ~90 lbs up to a 1 RM of 305 in two years!  I was putting on lots of muscle mass, but after I stopped doing Atkins, my weight went back up to 185. \n Back in 2010, I started working out with a strength coach who was much more knowledgable than my former trainer, and he helped me immensely with my form.  He also strongly encouraged me to drop my body fat level down, as it was still over 20%.  I had never been a runner - I have a minor case of exercise induced asthma, and running would set it off almost immediately.  But he talked me into it, and I started C25K.  Over a summer, I was running 5K non-stop and I really started to  enjoy  running.  He also encouraged me to avoid grains, dairy and processed foods.  In February 2010, I joined  Fitocracy .

How is a 5'8\" woman that's 120 lbs 27% bodyfat? Because bodyfat is a  percentage , remember? and I had very little muscle. So armed with this new knowledge, I figured, hey, all I gotta do is build some muscle, and it will totally rejigger that number down to something healthy, with a chance of abs. \n So I decided to rebuild my body out of better components. More muscle, less fat. A total rework and a fun hacking adventure- definitely the kind of experiment I enjoy.

The days I train with the team, we're in small groups (2 or 4 of us grouped by strength, usually) and do an upper body/lower body split. We tend to do a ton of reps 12-25 and often have assistance/do negatives/do drop sets when we reach failure. The days I train by myself I follow 5/3/1 with assistance that mirrors what I do with the team- lots of glute/ham/shoulder work at ~15 reps. I dubbed it 5/3/1 Bikini. I do cardio, but not tons- it turns into more as I get depleted close to the show because my heart rate slows dramatically. The cardio that used to take 20 minutes can take 40. \n Diet  - This is the biggie and takes a ton of discipline. I love going to lift, can tolerate cardio, but what kind of lunatic wants to live on tilapia and 25g of brown rice carbs? I eat 6 meals a day to avoid chewing my own tongue off and while it is good food that I make for myself and carry with me everywhere, it takes a stupid amount of discipline to exist in a world full of free donuts, shared pizzas, and pitchers of beer. I eat constantly and my meals are between 200 and 400 calories a piece. I get over 200g of protein per day. Necessarily I eat \"clean.\" Hate the term, but really, it just means I can't add \"stuff\" when every calorie counts and most of those calories have to be protein. Another way of looking at it is that what fits my macros is chicken, spinach and a nibble of sweet potato- not Haagen-Dazs (sadly). As comp prep goes on, and my physique is assessed my daily menu gets adjusted every 2 weeks and then weekly, protein always staying at the same level and fats and carbs getting ratcheted down. \n Show prep  - Prepping for a show usually takes about 6-8 weeks if you've been training hard consistently. This show I needed 6 weeks and all that it means when I go from off-season mode to on-season is that I turn up the cardio to 2 x per day, and shave some carbs and fats off my diet. My lifting basically stays the same (towards the end volume is turned all the way up). \n Day of  - A bodybuilding show generally has Men's Physique and Bodybuilding and Women's Bikini, Figure, Physique and Bodybuilding (maybe, not a lot of competitors at this level anymore) which are all judged by their own criteria. Bikini and Physique are still pretty new categories and suffer a little bit from inconsistent judging as everyone gets comfortable with the new standards. Ex: some judges like super stick skinny bikini competitors, some like meatier, more muscular ones. Women's categories are broken into height classes, I am in the tallest class, Open Bikini F for women over 18 years of age and over 5'7\" (my NPC card says I am 5'7.5\"). Next year I will qualify for Master's 35+ division, though I will still compete against the whippersnappers in Open. \n I went into this show feeling a lot better about my physique than my previous 2 shows- the last one being 6 months ago. Prep was easier, I was definitely more trusting of the process. I knew to expect the moodiness, exhaustion, lack of libido, and other BS that comes along with show prep, so I could better filter what came out of my mouth during this period (is this something that would normally piss you off? y/n? n? keep mouth shut.). Once I saw the pictures though, I was really disappointed in my glutes. Was I having a bad ass-day? Did it really  look  like that. Then I got the video yesterday. Yeah, it looks terrible. All that work to lift and perkify and my butt looks flat sad and downtrodden next to the rest of the competition and what a bikini booty is supposed to look like. I wrote to the judges and my assessment was correct, my glutes need tightening, lower body needs more leanness and so it's back to the drawing board. I was going to compete again in a couple weeks but there's really no point if that's what I'm bringing to the stage. This stuff takes time, and you can't build when you're cutting, so it's time to eat and thrust dem barbells.": "weightroom",
            "After I build a strength base with StrongLifts for about 7 months, I basically picked a major. I was going to focus on building a bikini competitor body and that meant a huge change in my training. I trained. under the supervision of my coach, circuits (upper/lower body split) and added in cardio (not a ton- 20-25 mins). That's when my diet also saw a big shift- she essentially doubled my protein to 230g per day, increased my calories and watched my weight drop. It was eye opening. I was stuffed all the time. Eating every 2 hours. So I put on muscle in all the places we were targeting and about 7 weeks before the competition, she started to diet me down for the show, every 2 weeks I got a new meal plan- [here's week 5]( The goal is keep as much muscle that you worked so hard to put on and lose fat so you could see the muscle. So you end up working out 2x per day 7 days a week until you simply  must  rest. This is when I got my first taste of \"overtraining.\" You feel like you've been hit by a train. \n Now I'm in my off season, where I'm eating like crazy again, and am lifting 4 days a week. I train with my bikini/figure team on Tues & Thurs in an hour circuit in the weightroom that is just BRUTAL. And then on Monday and Friday, I do a version of 5/3/1 that has accessories that will help my bikini physique move in the right direction. It's based loosely on Dave Tate's Periodization accessories to 5/3/1, I named it [5/3/1 for Bikini]( \n My workouts are not something you'd want to jump into yet- that's actually something I wish I could impress upon the folks that follow my workouts on Fitocracy. It's tempting to look at someone and say, \"I want their physique, so I'll do their workout.\" Building your body to look a certain way is a process, with steps to follow. If you skip the first 3 steps, it's not going to get you there any faster, if you get there at all. I realize you're not going to do this, but it's something to keep in your mind as your body changes. There will be days where it feels like it's going in the right direction, and days when you feel like you're bigger and have more fat on you than ever before. It's ok. It's part of the process.": "Fitness",
            "Another vote for \"I never sanitize the top off water.\" \n In addition, while I'm counting on the stuff that water companies sell in stores is clean enough, I use bags of store-bought ice too. This really helps cool the wort to pitchable temp immediately, naturally resulting in less time for sitting around growing things that are not your yeast. So the \"risk\" of contaminating with bagged ice that isn't perfectly clean is worth it in my mind. \n Here's what I do: \n \n Set up my carboy with a big widemouth, slender necked funnel in it. \n \n Fill the funnel with ice. \n \n Strain the hot wort over the ice-filled funnel into the carboy, replacing ice as it melts. \n \n Top it up with room temp bottled water to the 5 gallon mark on the carboy. \n \n \n Usually at that point your wort will be cool enough to pitch the yeast right then and there!": "Homebrewing",

You don't want to hear about it. ESPECIALLY when we're eating together. There's something inherently judgy about it- I have made this choice, which I  necessarily  think is a better choice (else I wouldn't have made it). So I don't talk about it because I really truly don't give a fuck what anyone else eats, and don't want others to think I think less of them because of their choices. \n I choose to lift, which points to me thinking this is a superior choice than not lifting. Therefore, reminding him of my choice feels like an easy to misinterpret thing, so I avoid it. I don't think less of him for not lifting, AT ALL. Not even a tiny bit.": "weightroom",
            "I would also dig a virtual Bodybuilding/Figure competition, but I have NO idea how to make that fair (other than how BTFC does it) and would like to use some actual judging criteria. Thoughts? \n This would be nearly impossible to pull off- it's just a little too complex I think. You can use the same judging criteria as the NPC/IFBB, but what would you be judging? Pictures? Video of posing routines? Decisions are made in a real show based on comparisons and having competitors standing next to each other is a big part of that. And then comes the added complication of what it really takes to look competition ready. If you're a powerlifter, you can video your lifts, do your best and ensure the angle is good enough to judge the validity of the lift. You can do this any day you feel up to it. Bodybuilders don't wake up any morning and think, yeah, I look ready for a show, lets throw on my sparkly bullshit and tape some poses. I mean, I guess you could, but you'd look like ass probably. To really have it be a contest means prepping as if it were a contest, which is pretty miserable. I don't treat BTFC like a bodybuilding competition. It's just not worth it. So it comes down to would anyone really treat this like a bodybuilding competition- months/weeks of dieting/cardio and then dehydration? I don't see how I could because it would actually eat a chunk of time out of my  actual  IRL bulk/cut/compete cycles. \n So after all that rambling, an alternative suggestion. Meet reports for strength contests are welcome here (one of my favorite things about /r/weightroom, actually) but I don't think anyone's ever posted a write up about how a bb comp has gone. I know I haven't because it seems like it might not be welcome and I'd rather not contribute to cluttering this joint up if no one's interested. But maybe they are interested. Sure, our strength isn't tested, but you can't get up on that stage without spending an epic amount of time lifting and those of us focused on hypertrophy may have things to share that would be beneficial to the community as a whole. So I ask you to wave your wand and give your blessing to include bodybuilding competitions as an approved topic to write a meet report on.": "weightroom"

            "I'm keeping on with the keeping on. I had a weird hip thing this morning that made it a little awkward getting around the house for about 10 minutes, but otherwise feeling well. Ever since I came down with illness right after Christmas, I feel a little nauseated if I haven't eaten in several hours. Sounds like I've got an ulcer, though it certainly isn't as bad as it was in the summer of 2012 - that was the worst. Do I sound ancient yet? I feel like it some days. If I've got ulcer problems, maybe I shouldn't go running when it finally warms up this weekend. The cold weather smacking around the U.S. has been damn cold but bearable for me and mine, and my car has done me right and has gotten me everywhere I've needed to go, started up like a dream, etc. But I can't tell you how many friends of mine scattered across the U.S. have reported their pipes having burst, cars broken down, houses damn near uninhabitable due to the terrible, uncharacteristic cold in their part of the world. My own sister had to go stay with my dad last night because it was 34F inside her house. When it goes from one-upping whose weather is more extreme on social networks to people actually having damage to their property and being physically uncomfortable in their own homes, that's when I get super flippin' tired of this polar vortex crap and people's attitudes about how the American South can't handle cold. When it's -2F here and our infrastructure/houses/HVAC systems (IF we even have them, this rural place is poorer than shit) can't handle it, I think even we reserve some right to actually complain, thanks - p.s. I can't even fathom -40F, sorry that you suddenly live in Antarctica, North Dakotans.": "90daysgoal",
            "I know, I KNOW, I should have just ordered a tankini in my bra size online somewhere. But I had my money from my bonus burning a hole in my pocket, and yesterday, I was on a mission. That mission may now lead me to hauling the sewing machine out of the shed. Here's the tale: \n I am going on vacation next month and have been in need of a swimsuit top. I lost a lot of weight two years ago; I lost even more weight since the last time I bought swimwear, so I have some swim bottoms, but the top was pretty much falling off me. I wanted a tankini top that didn't have molded cups that were way too small. You all know how it is when you're trying to shop for swimsuits in most brick-and-mortar stores. \n After visits to several stores in the small college town where I do my offline shopping, I found  this  last night. This is a tankini that you can wear as a halter or as strapless, as the straps can be tied behind your back. \n Now, I usually fit into a 34G. The size range available in this top in cup size/band size, but you know they're not going to have 34G. I narrowed it down between 38D and 40D, and I picked up the 38D just because the cups were gapping in the 40D, and I could maybe deal with the 38D being so unsupportive, despite being molded, bra-shaped, and underwired. \n I wore the new swimsuit top as I worked out in the yard to work on a base tan for vacation. I came to the conclusion that the tankini needs to be more closely fitted so that it stays up better. I am going on vacation with women I work with, and I'm sure they're not going to be that excited to see so much cleavage and side boob. I mean, yes, we'll all be in swimsuits, so we're all going to see a lot more of one another's bodies, true, but I feel like I'm half hanging out of this thing. \n I could probably take in the sides to tailor it, but I don't know how swimsuit material is going to react to sewing. \n Soooo long story short, has anyone ever altered a swimsuit top with any kind of success or failure? I must note that I am quite an amateur seamstress, mostly sewing by hand when I do sew. The last time I used a proper sewing machine, Miley Cyrus had not yet been born. I really like this top and think I can make it work. I almost wish I'd gone with an online retailer, but the money's been spent, so it's too late now. I am having a make it work moment and would appreciate tips, feedback, bad stories, a wake-up call that I've irretrievably screwed up, or pictures of cute llamas and alpacas.": "bigboobproblems",

            "There really aren't many movies that offer 7 channel, let alone 11 channel. Last time I checked there were literally a handfull of Atmos movies, and the technology doesn't seem to be gaining traction, so I wouldn't expect much more. \n You have the budget for a killer 7.2 system that would be far, far better and more immersive than a subpar 11 channel system. Plus, you can always upgrade the receiver and put in the ceiling speakers at a later date. \n For receiver, I would go with the [Denon x2000]( as a stopgap for a future 4k receiver. It's $300, has Audyssey Silver for room correction, and plenty of power for high efficiency speakers. \n I'm assuming you are going with a projector system for video, and if so, I would recommend going with an acoustically transparent screen with speakers behind. This gives you the option of using any speakers for your LCR, regardless of aesthetics. With your budget, you have a lot of options for LCR. \n I would recommend pro-theater or pro-audio speakers for a behind the screen system. You are getting far more performance per dollar than any of the more aesthetically pleasing typical HT speakers. If you can find a good deal or some used, JBL or Klipsch pro-theater screen array speakers will simply wreck any other option for LCR. You may be able to find some of these options for 500-700 each. Alternately, there are plenty of options for pro-audio speakers starting at around $200 each for Behringer or Mackie entry level passives. \n Any of these pro type speakers will typically have 96db+ sensitivity and will hit reference level volume like it was nothing with the above receiver. \n For subs, I would recommend 2 Hsu VTF-2 or SVS pb-1000 subs with are around $1000 for the pair. If your good at building stuff, you can DIY 2 subs for about $750 that will have similar extension and more output. 2 subs will better pressurise a large room and eliminate a lot of the room modes and palcement issues 1 sub has. \n For surrounds, whatever fits your room and has decent sensitivity to match the front channels. These are really far, far less important than your LCR and subs, as 90% of your content goes through those speakers. I really wouldn't spend a lot here. \n If you have any questions, let me know, I recently did about 4 months of research on building budget reference level theater audio setups that can compete with real theater sound, something I've never heard from any of the typical HT speaker companies speakers.": "hometheater",
            "Prohormones are essentially less efficient oral anabolic/androgenic steroids. The oral bioavailability of the AAS compounds is low due to how much they have to be processed through the liver. Consequently, the compounds causes significant liver strain, even more than standard oral AAS, and certainly much more than injectable AAS which often have no/little liver involvement. It is very easy for an unknowing person to cause serious liver damage with PH as they are marketed as a supplement instead of a real AAS. \n All of the same side effects of AAS are present with PHs although usually at much lower occurrence/magnitude due to low dosing.  Since many PHs will shut down natural Test production due to disruption of the [HPG Axis]( its common to experience low/no libido and ED due to low Testosterone. \n Also, users of PHs often have no idea that proper medicinal PCT is necessary. They think because its just a supplement, they can use some other 'natural' PCT supplement instead of tamoxifen/clomiphene/toremifene. These drugs either need a script or to be ordered from a grey market international source, similar to where you would purchase standard AAS. \n One last thing that is absurdly common, is people on prohormones giving shit to standard AAS users. If you take PHs, you are 'on' just like them. You are no longer a natural athlete when/after taking prohormones. I see this all the time. Its especially hilarious since they are basically taking a less effective, more harmful version of the same thing everyone else is (relatively) safely injecting.": "Supplements",
            "Any decent DAC is (or should be in theory) a transparent component.  The DAC in your receiver is most likely just as good as any USB dac. The only exception would be a really cheap receiver might not have a properly shielded/isolated DAC that introduces noise in to the signal, but I haven't run across a receiver with this problem, even budget ones. \n If you have thin sound, speakers are the first place I would look.

            "Great post. \n AAS are not for people that aren't committed to lifting for life or at least the foreseeable future. TRT/cruising with blast cycles provides far better results, less stress on your endocrine system, no loosing gains, no unnecessary drugs(pct drugs can have worse sides than AAS). ~2 years of blasting and cruising will produce the same kind of results as ~4+ years of cycling, and is the major difference you see in people that have serious mass/strength vs guys that stay just above natural levels. \n On top of that, TRT has amazing benefits on aging, mental health and sexual function. A huge portion of the symptoms of aging - loss of lean mass, increased bodyfat, depression/anxiety, skin health, bone density to name a few - are massively slowed and some even prevented by testosterone and GH replacement therapy. Starting earlier only increases the anti-aging properties. Virtually every male will fall in to the low range by 40-50, and some people(especially in recent generations) will be low by their late 20s early 30s. Properly prescribed, it also provides more stable T levels than our bodies naturally produce, resulting in much more balanced overall mental state(to me, and theres plenty of other anecdotal evidence of this). There is even clinical data linking low T with cardiovascular issues later in life. It's hard for me to believe that testosterone levels aren't regularly checked later in life, and that many doctors, probably the majority, will flat out refuse to prescribe it due to their personal views on anabolics.": "bodybuilding",

Started trying to get stronger, and spent a couple months stuck right around a 1k total. \n My first gym closed, so I had to find another 24 hour gym as I worked 2nd shift. I then found my current temple, a small no bullshit powerlifting gym run by a multiple world record holding powerlifter and a team of strong ass motherfuckers. I was instantly blown away by their lifting and got consumed by powerlifting. With their help, I went from stagnating at 1k to 1300 in just over a year. Got in to equipped lifting and put up some ok single ply numbers, other than my shitty bench. Dabbled in some multiply lifting. By this point, I was obsessed with lifting, I rarely miss a day, and feel shitty if I do. A far cry from my lazy fat self that could barely be bothered to stop playing video games to take out the trash. \n I'm currently taking on a new set of goals.

You can take a break from working towards your big goals (i.e. some people will be a little more lax with diet, for example) before the next push forward if you feel like you might burn out, or you can continue as you were doing before!  I tend to stay on point with diet and exercise and everything during the breaks.  Regardless of what you do, it's a useful few days for reflecting on the past 30 days and what you accomplished and what went well, and you can reassess your goals and progress and come up with what you want to do for the next sprint and readjust the plan if necessary. \n Uhh... so": "90daysgoal",

            "Hi! Thanks in advance for any help. It's a bit of a text wall so I've broken it down into sections and there's a summary at the end :) \n A: current setup \n I'm trying to update my home media setup, which currently is just a 3 yo windows gaming laptop connected via HDMI to a projector, with a soundbar connected for audio. I use a combination of streaming services, sites and torrents as well as music stored on my computer. \n My laptop is getting really creaky and the 800gb or so of space is almost full up, so what I'd like to do is move my media somewhere it has roome to grow, as well as reinstall windows. \n B: why not NAS (please correct if wrong) \n I originally thought I'd spring for a Chromecast and Synology NAS with 2-4TB in RAID and use its native OS / media apps to control it from my phone, but realised: \n \n Streaming video to my chromecast is horrendously jerky over my home connection \n I'd have to rewire my house (currently wifi router is in hallway, gets kicked over occasionally and as I'd need to connect NAS to the router by LAN cable I didn't want to risk the NAS getting damaged) \n I'd have to spring for an expensive NAS box (I was looking at Synology) for it to be able to reliable encode HD video \n I wouldn't use some of the features of the NAS (no desire to access my media outside of my home network, no need to host any other software or data) \n It would be better to just have a computer connected directly via HDMI to the projector and have audio jacked in directly (though I could conceivably set up a bluetooth receiver similar to the ones made by [Belkin]( \n \n C: what I need to be able to do at the lowest price (in the UK) \n So this points me to a small HTPC. As I haven't looked at specs for a while, I'm at a bit of a loss of how powerful a machine I need to: \n \n Run a torrent client \n Accept 2-4TB of storage, either internally (preferably RAID) or externally, as media will be indexed for rapid searching and will only need to be accessed 1 file at a  time \n Stream web-based content either in browser or with a dedicated app \n Run something like Kodi to organise and play back stored media \n Allow remote access over a home network (or maybe just standard sharing) \n Allow me to view audio files through an android phone, but play on the HTPC (which would be hooked up to speakers, I think this is a KOBI features)  this is because I don't have a monitor for browsing the computer due to my main non-laptop screen being a projector, so I want to be able to access and playback audio without having to turn on the projector. \n \n I keep finding HTPCs that either cost  500+ pounds  or [cheap ones]( which I could just hook up some external storage to that I'm worried would be underpowered.": "htpc",

            "Ish... pullups respond well to overall volume, but the relationship between how many you can do over a day versus how that brings up the maximum you can cluster into a set varies from person-to-person. \n An extreme case of this is doing a set of pullups to near failure every hour (e.g. if you work at home or are a student with enough off days). Because this can lead you to doing >100 PUs per day (i.e. more than you'd do in a typical training session), this will ramp up your capacity as well as drive decent muscle growth, due to sheer volume. c/f Pavel Tsatsouline on this. \n However what you're doing describes something closer to the myo reps methodology (search this sub), putting that all into a shorter space of time. However, like /u/Strikerrjones says, you're gonna have to do more than one rep per burst to get the most out of it. \n Finally, rest-pause training has shown to be effective (find the studies or trust me as an anecdote), but that's still slightly different to what you're suggesting here.": "weightroom",

On the other hand, fats are better at those situations when you're not doing much (sitting at work, etc). High carbs before exercise will allow you to perform better and create a greater calorific deficit, which you can choose to leave, fill, or overstuff afterwards depending on if you're cutting, maintaining or bulking": "Paleo",

Started the 12-week version you find in some [spreadsheets]( and plugged in a conservative max.

And yet, through various training injuries, plus a left elbow that no longer fully extends and a weakened right shoulder from rugby ( Bully for you, OP, playing the gentleman's game! ), I feel that I've made progress down this road. \n I have been whalemode, ghandimode, t-rexmode and now approach dragonmode.

Sometimes the old school stuff works just fine. \n \n \n People get too caught up in staying healthy. Just by exercising, and by using common sense, you're going to stay healthy. Is it important to prehab/rehab/correct disfunctions? Yes. Not to the tune of 4 weeks worth of corrective exercise before starting a program, though. I usually do 1 session every 4 that focuses on mobility and corrective, but there is still either some strength or some high intensity (or both) in that same exercise. Otherwise I'll use it occasionally as part of the warmup. In a 1 hour session, roughly 5 minutes is spent on correctives. Not to accomplish anything other than a challenge and something new and different for the client. The vast majority of the people I've worked with have zero interest in building strength over/under/pulling the bar. I still make them do those exercises, though. \n The only people that I find need extensive corrective exercise are people that are extremely deconditioned or extremely overweight. And, to them, that is typically a hard workout. People coming off from 6-8+ months of PT or other type of rehab also benefit from an extended corrective exercise schedule, because that is the next logical progression. That said, if the rehab is because of a badly damaged lower extremity, there isn't a lot of reason to spend a lot of time prehabing their upper extremities. \n Let it be said, though, that pistols/single leg squats/single leg deadlifts do more than just improve your balance and \"correct muscle imbalances, they also help improve muscle recruitment and can actually make you stronger. Is it needed for people who powerlift on a regular basis? Probably not.

The problem I've found with CI/CO 'deniers' (for lack of a better term) is that they think it's super simple.  That the out side is some sort of unchanging, static number that is always true because that online calculator said so.  Nothing could be further from the truth, and even a casual understanding of biology would elucidate that.  Put 'simply' CI/CO means: \n Energy In (corrected for digestion) = (BMR + Thermic Effect of Food + Thermic Effect of Activity + Spontaneous Physical Activity/Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis) + Change in Body Stores \n The key point not shown in the equation but borne in real life is that both side are in constant flux, and any perturbation in one side  must  be balanced by adjustments of equal magnitude on the other.  But, on the out side, those changes don't necessarily have to come from the body stores.  You can wax ecstatic all you want about leptin, but the fact remains that it acts within the bounds of this equation.  The body is the sum result of this equilibrium (which is never static).

The mod team would like to encourage and invite all of you to be a part of this rebirth, and help us craft AF into the mighty force for good we all know it can and should be. \n Before I get into the changes we\u2019re looking to unveil, I want to take a moment to reiterate what this sub is supposed to be about. \n r/advancedfitness is a place to learn, teach, and share information on the myriad ways we all work to improve our health and fitness, and achieve our training goals.  AF is the clear signal that rises above the noise of r/fitness.  Our subject and user bases are broad and we recognize there is no One True Way^TM to see results.  We are open-minded and thoughtful.  We are evidence based, and we recognize that knowledge and evidence come from [various sources](   We are not solely a weightlifting reddit, nor shall this sub be devoid of that or any other content.  This is a place for timely and coherent discussions about issues in health, fitness, nutrition, and exercise. \n In short, if you want to see posts and comments relevant to your passion, you need to create posts relevant to your passion.  Ultimately, the content of this subreddit is determined by you and your posts  and we want to see those posts. \n Please do not get hung up on the \u2018advanced\u2019 in r/advancesfitness.  If you\u2019re reading this you\u2019re already on the A-Team.  We\u2019re all here to learn and to improve ourselves, whether we are just starting out or have years of experience.  However, that is not to say that all content will be welcomed and embraced, and this  is  where the mods will be upholding the \u2018advanced\u2019 criteria.  Although the info in the side bar needs some updating, the following [post criteria still stands]( \n >Inappropriate Topics (not a complete list) \n >  How do I start working out, lose weight, gain muscle, tone up, etc. Those should be in  /r/Fitness  (only  after* reading their [FAQ]( \n \n Rage/f7u12/meme comics  \n \"Lack of motivation\" threads  \n Karma whoring  \n \n Remember: more signal, less noise. \n The mods reserve the right to remove any post for any reason, but we also want the community to be self policing through the vote arrows.  Please remember proper [reddiquette](   Just because you don\u2019t care about yoga doesn\u2019t mean you should downvote a post about it. \n To start off the changes,  starting immediately AF will now be allowing link posts  in addition to the self posts.  Please use your best judgment in ensuring they are appropriate for this sub.  To help get the ball (and the content) rolling, we are offering a short-term allowance for reposts.   This is not an open call for karma whoring  - suspected violators will be dealt with appropriately.  This is a call for those pages you have bookmarked that are still as good today as the first time you read them.  This allowance is to share your favorite resources with those who may be unaware or who have missed them the first time.  Remember,  we want quality not quantity . \n In the coming weeks we hope to unveil more features.  The member spotlight posts will become regular again with an occasional \u2018spotlight redux\u2019 to check in with previous honorees.  We\u2019ll be looking to create some interactive challenges both here and in our [Fitocracy group](   The sidebar will be updated with new content and we will be reaching out to other subs to form partnerships and a network of fitness-focused subs.  If you have other ideas on how to make this a better sub, please feel free to share them.": "AdvancedFitness",
            "Greetings, r/fitness. \n As many of you are no doubt aware, a few days ago there was a meta-esque post about user etiquette and attitudes in our little corner of the interweb.  More specifically, the discussion centered around the treatment of our female users. \n While I'm sure everyone involved took away something different from that thread, it is important for the community to know how the mods are reacting to the discussion. \n First and foremost, the mods have renewed our commitment to fostering a civil environment to discuss fitness.  This should not be a surprise to anyone as it's been standard policy for quite some time now.  If, for some reason this is news to you, please be aware that: \n \n [This post]( has been linked on the sidebar for over two years.  \n Clicking 'reply' on any existing comment brought up [this warning]( \n \n Moving forward, we have created a new section of the FAQ more clearly outlining this policy.  [ Right at the top, in big bold letters ]( \n >/r/Fitness is a place to discuss fitness in a civil manner. Hate speech is not allowed here, including (but not limited to) racist, misogynistic, sexist, aggressive, or overtly offensive comments that have nothing to do with fitness. These comments, whether intended to be a joke or not, are prohibited. Commenters can and will be banned for such behavior at the discretion of the mods without warning. \n Also, we will be adding a style tweak soon to get the text of this rule in the parent comment box. \n And before we get a dozen comments about how visibility is not the problem (trust us, we know), at the very least it cannot be used as an excuse. \n Please note that the penalty for violating this rule is the banhammer.   No warnings or simply removing the comment.  This sort of behavior is not acceptable and you will be booted for it. \n Someone recently asked the question of the mods, \"Where is the line?\"   Simply put, there is no hard and fast line.  Some comments are obviously violating this rule, other times it's not so obvious.  Please bear in mind that context is paramount and that your mods are human.  There is a lot of gray to work with here. \n Secondly, we want to put some (most?) of this onus back on you, the user.  We cannot be in every thread all the time. \n \n Obviously, don't engage in this sort of behavior.  (Problem solved, right?) \n When you do see this behavior, speak up.  Leave a comment letting the user know such behavior is not welcome here.  Check out menuitem's post above again for more on this and/or consider setting up an [RES]( macro to make such comments easy.   \n Use the report feature.  We have AutoModerator set up so that three reports sends the mods an alert to check out the identified comment or post.  We do reserve the right to take no action on these, but it at least gets our eyes on something we may have missed. \n Downvote such behavior.  Often times people will self-police themselves when they find their comment tucked away in the bottom of a thread.   \n Remain calm .  Don't add fuel to a flame war.   \n \n Lastly and MOST EXCITING, via the genius of yours truly it was decided that the mod team could use some female perspective on such matters.  /u/MetaBoob was the first and only user mentioned for consideration.  Having seen her work over in /r/BTFC it was clear she was the perfect candidate.  Quite honestly she's one of the best mods I've ever seen.  She's been on the team for just over a week now and I've already been impressed several times. \n Please, r/fitness, help us welcome MetaBoob to the mod team! \n This post is largely preaching to the choir but unfortunately it does need to be said.  We've got a good community here, fittit, let's not forget that.  And as a community will can easily squash even the most vociferous internet trolls. \n Now go out and do your goddam squats.

            "Here in Darwin, Australia, we host a biennial sports festival called the Arafura Games. At this year's games, the weightlifting competition also included the Oceania and South Pacific championships. \n As a resident of the Northern Territory, I was able to be granted qualification to enter the weightlifting competition in the +105kg (super heavyweight) division. \n Also entered in the competition were Damon Kelly, Australia's Commonwealth gold medallist, and Itte Detenamo, the man Kelly beat for the gold in a thrilling contest in Delhi. \n While this meant I didn't expect to come even vaguely close to winning in such a phenomenal field of lifters, I was looking forward to lifting alongside them and representing my home state. \n On Sunday, disaster struck. I began a training session at the end of a weekend coaching course. The course involved many hours of practical work drilling the snatch, clean and jerk progressions and I was physically and mentally exhausted. During the training session I felt a sharp sudden pain in my lower left back. I knew from experience that I had hurt myself, possibly quite badly. \n I decided that I wanted to compete, no matter what. Even if I had to lift an empty bar I wanted to compete. I saw physiotherapists on Monday, Wednesday and today (Friday). I was finally diagnosed as having a bulged disc in my lower spine - a minor herniation. On Monday I was in a lot of pain, and after standing for most of Tuesday I was in terrible pain on Wednesday. On advice from a physio, I went home and stayed in bed almost constantly for 2 nights and a day -- and today I was able to walk and move almost without pain. \n The physiotherapist I saw today pre-contest said he was surprised at how quickly I've healed, given that spinal discs have almost zero bloodflow. I credit the recovery to my weightlifting training. \n And so it was that today, after having trouble walking, standing or sitting for almost a week, I was able to complete the competition. \n My big shock this morning was discovering that under the IWF rules, I must declare opening lifts high enough that the total would be within 20kg of my qualifying total. My qualifying total was 170kg, which meant I would need to have snatch + c&j of 150kg or better declared at weigh-in. This was a shock as I had originally planned to make one token lift for each event. \n I went down to warmup feeling apprehensive. Snatches were a bit painful at first, but by modifying my form to a Papuan style, I was able to lift without pain. However I had to powersnatch as overhead squatting began to hurt my back. \n My opening snatch was 65kg and felt like it weighed nothing. I decided to change my plan and try for 70kg. It felt easy too -- no pain. Almost a military snatch. Finally I took 80kg and lifted it without too much effort. My competition PB in the snatch is 110kg. \n Next were C&Js. I had a lot of time to rest while the stronger lifters ran through their attempts. I started warming up. Because of the lower back injury, I switched from split jerks to power jerks. Again, squatting down in the receiving position caused pain, so I concentrated on powercleaning. \n I started with 85kg, which again felt easy. Then I went to 95kg, and a small drama occurred. While cleaning the bar my left hand slipped clear off during the receive. I couldn't pull my hand back by itself to get back under the bar. Remembering the rules about C&J, I decided to shrug the bar off my shoulders to reset the left hand -- and succeeded. I was told later by some experienced weightlifters that they had never seen anyone recover from that situation before. I power jerked it successully. Finally I cleaned and jerked 105kg. (My PB is 131kg). \n I had originally approached this competition hoping to lift 120kg/140kg, and I think that I would have made it easily but for the injury. The enforced bed rest meant that I went into the competition fully recovered and feeling fresh, apart from the soreness, niggles and occasional spike of pain. \n By focusing on my form I was easily able to power snatch, power clean and power jerk my way to 6 lifts out of 6, with 3 white lights all the way. While the total lifted is a personal worst, in many ways this is the competitive effort I am the most proud of. \n After I finished up, I got to watch Itte Detenamo smash 5 Commonwealth weightlifting records, including snatch, clean & jerk and total. He's now the strongest man in the Commonwealth and the strongest man in Oceania. It was a thrill to watch because I, despite injury, despite not being a jot on these mighty lifters, got to compete on the same stage with them, on an equal footing. It's an experience I'll never forget.": "Fitness",

This isn\u2019t a competition with prizes (check out /r/BTFC for that). This is a group of people working together to better themselves. Whether you want to change a lot or a little, gain muscle or lose weight, or work on things that aren't necessarily related to fitness (school, work, hobbies, friendships/family/relationships), everyone is welcome! More than anything else, this group will provide you with a place to talk to other people about health, fitness, and general self-improvement in a completely open and friendly environment. No question is too basic here. \n What\u2019s the format? \n Every morning the mods post a Daily Goal thread where you can post your goals for the day, ask questions, or read through other people\u2019s updates. There's a weekly check-in thread every Monday and several themed posts throughout the round to keep us all on track. \n If you'd like to join us for the next round, stop by and tell us about yourself and your goals in the [official introduction thread] ( Round 18 will officially begin on Monday, September 14th. On Day 1 there will be a signup form to fill out so that we can keep track of group statistics. Group and individual progress will be posted at the end of each month using a display name based on your age, gender, height, and weight (we'll describe how to decipher it all later). \n What are these sprints I keep hearing about? \n You'll see the word \"sprints\" thrown around quite a lot.  Don't worry, we're not going to force anyone to go sprinting.  Sprints are what we do to make it easier to stick to the whole 90 days!  We've split the 90 days into 3 sprints, each one 30 days long plus a 5 day rest period in between.  Why did we do this?  Well, we found out that more people stuck around if they could focus on their goals for shorter periods of time and then have a short rest to reassess their progress and priorities before resuming.  When you set your goals, you can not only set goals for the entire 90 days, but also for each sprint! \n What's the schedule? \n Sprint 1:  September 14 - October 13 \n Recovery:  October 14 - October 18 \n Sprint 2:  October 19 - November 17 \n Recovery:  November 18 - November 22 \n Sprint 3:  November 23 - December 22": "Stronglifts5x5",

            "Many new practitioners experience this. While 99% of the time it is nothing to be alarmed about, if he feels it ever gets worse or if it is beyond mild and short-lived discomfort he should absolutely ask a doctor. While many teachers like to use child's pose to recover, I advise using an easy seated pose, cross-legged sitting tall. This is because, as mentioned several times in other responses, it is best to keep your head above your heart if you get dizzy. For some people, child's pose drops the head below the heart. If he is having the issue right after his down dogs in every sun salutation, have him try doing a bent knee down dog for a less severe angle. He can also use child's pose briefly in this case so he can get right to it from the flow, but if it isn't helping he needs to sit up. \n Other tips: If he is going to a class that does multiple inversions, he should not push himself to do every one of those asanas. Also, he should let the teacher know he gets dizzy. When the practice heads into hand stands, head stands, shoulder stands, plow, etc he could quietly excuse himself to the back and do \"legs up the wall.\" Letting the teacher know ahead of time will allow him/her to say they like this idea or offer another idea. Legs up the wall is a super gentle inversion that is far less exhausting. This way, he can begin to experience the blood flow issues without simultaneously exerting himself muscularly. \n Most importantly, for most (not all) people this goes away over the course of a few months if they actively practice and stick to it. Many people overcome the physical side of this, others figure out how best to hydrate and when/how much they need to eat to avoid the feeling. \n Does he have any medical issues he knows about? Thyroid issues? Adrenal gland issues? Has he ever been treated for cancer? Diabetic or low blood sugar? Iron deficiency? He may be dizzy from the practice (sun salutation and inversions mostly), medical reasons, or both.": "yoga",

It is simply a much more physical practice.... 60 some-odd swing throughs in the Primary Series, in between all of the difficult asanas! That being said, in Ashtanga you do the opening series, closing series, and meditation always. Between the opening series and closing series you do either Primary, Secondary, etc depending on your level. When you get to an asana you cannot do, you are supposed to try a few times, and then skip to the closing series. So you learn slowly, gain strength, and only do what you are ready for.

I was (foolishly) balancing on an exhaust manifold one day trying to line up a blower with the blower and chain already on the engine when my partner on the other side slipped and dropped his half of the 50 lbs. I slipped too and on the way down my knee caps slammed into the exhaust manifold. Haven't been the same since. I did physical therapy for 6 months and went back to running and all of the usual required stuff after that. I like to be active so that was annoying. I also \"sprained\" my ankle on a 12 mile ruck march with a 50 lb ruck, and I (foolishly again) continued on it for about a mile before finally telling someone and getting a ride to the medic. They gave me crutches for a week and told me not to run for one month. I did what I was told and hated it (crutches meant not being allowed to do the parts of my job I actually liked). One year later when I got out and had my final physical, the doctor told me I had actually broken it and it healed itself in a slightly off alignment. Because they didn't bother to do x-rays when I \"sprained\" it, they had unknowingly signed me up for a life of cracks and pops, and a general feeling of looseness in my ankle. Yoga definitely helped me slowly build awesome foot muscles again by being barefoot and learning to grip the ground. All of the standing balances really strengthened my ankle.

            "With all respect, what you have written is only one interpretation of yoga. There is no reason why the Ashtanga 8 limbs cannot coexist with this, as the entire point is to reach the same ends of enlightenment and universal unity. Regardless of how we, as english speakers, interpret sanskrit writings, many of the yogis/gurus (that is a full topic on its own) we follow today are still alive or passed recently. While their teachings may not be the same as what you have discussed above, it does not mean they are not viable, work for many people, etc. I understand where you are coming from, I am constantly reading and learning more about the ancient writings. I have also read and reread many of the religious texts. One uniting factor in all interpretations of yoga that I have read/studied/learned thus far is that they all lead to the same interpretation of samahdi (over simplified I know), enlightenment. If physical poses (asanas to most of us) work for withdrawal of the senses and other limbs (again more language I know you are refuting) for people, there is no reason in my mind to not promote this  practice  of yoga. \n For the record, my physical practice is largely based on Ashtanga, but I do many types and styles of physical practice as a student and as an instructor.

            "as far as the dot thing: \n tire manufacturers all do the dots differently. Some companies like general tire have three different dots, some like Michelin don't put any on certain tires. often on directional tires, the dot is on one side only, or on symmetrical tires with the DOT number (which must be mounted out) on the opposite side of the dot. This makes for very inconsistent dot placement between different tires. \n Furthermore, the imbalances of the tire that were calculated for placement of the dot are often gone within he first thousand miles or so, due to the way vehicles wear their tires. This is also why rotation and balances are recommended so early after getting new tires. Finally, the fact of the matter is that the entire point of balancing is to cancel out the weight differences. The only way aligning the dot is going to really help with that is if the tire was going on a perfectly round, perfectly balanced wheel, which never happens. If the wheel is balanced, then the placement of the dot makes no difference whatsoever. \n i'd also like to point out that tires often get turned to make the ride better, which will set the dot to a different spot.": "Justrolledintotheshop",

The other route you can go is to buy a less expensive model, and use upgrades. the advantages to this are that insurance won't go up as long as you don't tell them about it (or let them know that you track it. For the sake of your wallet never let them know your car has been anywhere near a track), and on top of that you get to work on your car and build a more intimate understanding of it.

I don't see how that's possible if I can just go up to the leading department and opt to take over the lease myself and keep paying all the bills as per usual.  Now here's where it gets tricky. The reason he's moving out is because we had an argument over his motorcycle (is uninsured and doesn't have valid tags registered to the bike nor does he have a valid drivers license) where I slid out on it and caused approximately $311.00 of damages which are already fixed and the motorcycle is currently held at a local shop which he signed for and I'm paying the damages. He just barged in and took my TV which cost about $600.00 as \"collateral\" without my consent and has two rather expensive suits of mine (suits totaling around $1100.00) in his possession, again against my consent. What I want to know is once I pay his bike off if he refuses to return any of my stuff or if he tries to follow through with the eviction, does he have any grounds that I should be worried about? Also I have screen shots of most of our  text conversations highlighting him bringing up the option of him moving out and then willingly confirming that option as well as texts where he admits to taking the TV and clothes. Where do I go from here?": "legaladvice",

            "They're all really a \"guesstimate\".  I know.  I hate that phrase too. \n The ECU reads all of the sensors so many times a second.  Usually this number is pretty high.  I can't remember at the moment.  The sensors take readings which are based on voltage resistance.  There are sensors that read intake air temp and flow, throttle position, exhaust temp and composition, timing, fuel flow rate, and so on and so on.  There is a butt load of sensors located in and around your engine monitoring a large number of variables. \n There is an optimum range for all of these readings.  The raw data  just shows voltage readings.  What a Scan Gauge will do is take all of those readings and use some fancy math to convert them for you so it's easy to read.  Stock mileage calculators don't get as deep as to display something such as your timing but they use this data none-the-less. \n Now, to calculate that data and give you a mileage calculation they likely use some logarithmic formula created for that engine size and type along with the transmission.  This calculation has to be recalculated probably hundreds of times a second with new variables. \n With all of these calculations there is bound to be wiggle room somewhere.  Luckily there is an easy way to figure out just how \"off\" the computer is.  Take the average mileage that you obtained during a tank of gas.  Many vehicles and aftermarket computers can keep track of this.  Now fill up your vehicle and divide the amount you used to fill it by how many miles you've driven.": "Frugal",

            "That is totally inaccurate. You think modern ECUs aren't capable of making adjustments to utilize better fuel? Do you know how flexfuel works?\nIs this all ECUs? Of course not. But you're also wrong saying that none do. I'm not talking out of my ass here. I'm willing to bet I've spent more time both tuning, and building fuel injection systems/ECU maps from scratch than the average person. If the ECU has the ability to advance timing, and the fuel will allow It, it will.\nAnd that is only taking into account what the computer can do for us. What about ethanol content? Where I live (varies by region), regular gasoline is 10% ethanol. Premium is 0% ethanol. Now, because of this, 1 gallon of regular gasoline has 3% LESS energy in it than 1 gallon of ethanol free fuel. And this 3% is totally unaffected by what the engine design. Ethanol simply has less energy per unit volume than gasoline. So if the price were within 3%, you'd be at break even running premium even before your computer made adjustments to increase efficiency. This fact alone proves that you WILL drive 3%+ further on a tank of ethanol free premium than you will on a tank of regular with 10% ethanol. Is this enough to offset the cost for premium? No. But if the ECU can help make up the difference, great. All in can say is try it if you want. Run premium and track it for 3mos then do the same with regular and see what happens.

This causes decreased coolant flow and overheating, particularly at lower engine speeds. But I still have a feeling he is just taking a shot in the dark and this might not fix the issues. Also, when doing the timing belt and water pump, do the tensioner and rollers too. It's cheap insurance. \n Has he verified that the thermostat is working correctly? If not, I'd do that.

My grandfather was rather eccentric - he always had the means to buy a new car, but  never  did.

He then proceeded to browse the current stock, but in the end decided he didn't like anything there...until he saw an orange convertible tucked away in a corner. He then asked the Salesman how much he'd want for it. The Salesman in turn responded that it was actually his wife's car that he had borrowed for the day, but given the right sum, he would part with it and deal with his wife's eternal fury. Since this car was actually a surprise for my grandmother and a gift, we never knew the sum. But Anyways, that is how the car came into my family's possession. \n PART 2 -- 20 years later... \n My parents are involved in a pot-luck group. My godfather (who also restored a beautiful 1956 Rolls-Royce SC - which I took to grad) had brought two friends who happened to be twins to dinner. As the night went on, the conversation inevitably turned to cars. My Godfather and my dad had their turns, at which point it was the twins turn to tell the story. They said that one day, their father's car had broken down in their driveway and needed to go to work - so without telling their mother, had  absconded  with their mother's car. Later that night, he came home in a taxi, which threw their mother into a panic attack - \"Did something happen? Are you allright?\" \n ...\"Sorry honey, I sold your car\"... \n At this point my mum realized that this story sounded very familiar..she proceeded to question the twins - \"Was the car a Pontiac? Convertible? Orange?\" Yes, Yes, and VERY Yes. As it turns out - it was their father that sold the car to my grandfather, and in due course my mother told the twins that we still had the car in the garage - with my name on it. (They were very jealous, because their 16th birthdays were apparently less than 2 weeks away from when their father sold the car, and they wanted to drive it).

Anyways - what eventually caused him to pass away was a series of strokes, which started in 1986 - the year my parents were married. \n The last time my grandfather -or anyone for that matter- ever drove this car, was to take my mother to her wedding.

He put on a MSD distributor, repainted the engine to factory colour, dismantled, cleaned, and bored it out. We also dumped a pair of chromed magnaflows on it for shits and giggles. And finally, as per my wish, he put on a 4 barrel carburetor (QFT Q-750). I picked it up, after nearly a full year in the shop last thursday. I drove it for short spurts all thursday. Over the weekend, I steadily drove it more and more, increasing the run time and distance. I was aware that it was running rich (these carbs have a tendency to run rich out of the box) and tuned it to be slightly more lean. It ran fine ALL week and weekend until yesterday. \n Yesterday I was driving to my friend's home in a small town south of the city, where he keeps his '65 Corvair Corsa. Anyways, on the highway the throttle stuck and went all Toyota. ie. it began accelerating on it's own accord. At idle, the engine runs about 4k rpm, and driving it starts at 1200, and will accelerate and shift on it's own [it's an auto :( ]. Pulled it into the garage and let it cool, thinking that the choke had something to do with it. So far I believe it's the Fast Idle Cam...maybe stuck? or the choke has stuck. \n CUT TO THE CHASE!

            "In 1972, my mother wrapped my grandmother's Valiant around a lamp post and totaled the car. My grandfather was rather eccentric - he always had the means to buy a new car, but never did.  Ever . \n PART 1 \n So, he went to a used car dealership in Transcona (a district inside Winnipeg) called CrossRoads (the dealer tag is still on the trunk). He then proceeded to browse the current stock, but in the end decided he didn't like anything there...until he saw an orange convertible tucked away in a corner. He then asked the Salesman how much he'd want for it. The Salesman in turn responded that it was actually his wife's car that he had borrowed for the day, but given the right sum, he would part with it and deal with his wife's eternal fury. Since this car was actually a surprise for my grandmother and a gift, we never knew the sum. But Anyways, that is how the car came into my family's possession. \n PART 2 -- 20 years later... \n My parents are involved in a pot-luck group. My godfather (who also restored a beautiful 1956 Rolls-Royce SC - which I took to grad) had brought two friends who happened to be twins to dinner. As the night went on, the conversation inevitably turned to cars. My Godfather and my dad had their turns, at which point it was the twins turn to tell the story. They said that one day, their father's car had broken down in their driveway and needed to go to work - so without telling their mother, had absconded with their mother's car. Later that night, he came home in a taxi, which threw their mother into a panic attack - \"Did something happen? Are you allright?\" \n ...\"Sorry honey, I sold your car\"... \n At this point my mum realized that this story sounded very familiar..she proceeded to question the twins - \"Was the car a Pontiac? Convertible? Orange?\" Yes, Yes, and VERY Yes. As it turns out - it was their father that sold the car to my grandfather, and in due course my mother told the twins that we still had the car in the garage - with my name on it. (They were very jealous, because their 16th birthdays were apparently less than 2 weeks away from when their father sold the car, and they wanted to drive it). Anyways - my parents are driving it to the next potluck to rub it in a bit. \n PART 3 \n My grandfather died when I had just turned 1. My entire life I've always looked up to the person that he was, and always told how much I resemble him in personality, hobbies, looks, everything. The car may have been my grandmother's but to me, it is as close to my grandfather as I'd ever get. It sat in HIS garage for 25 years - I fixed and cleaned it with HIS tools - it had HIS stuff in the trunk - to me it's a time capsule of his identity. Anyways - what eventually caused him to pass away was a series of strokes, which started in 1986 - the year my parents were married. \n The last time my grandfather -or anyone for that matter- ever drove this car, was to take my mother to her wedding. A week later, my grandfather had his first stroke, the Firebird was parked - and never driven again. That is, until I came along.": "classiccars",

I was taking my Firebird which just had a fresh rebuild but had some CRAZY electrical/starter/timing issues to my friend's house where he has a lift. \n Driving down the perimeter, the road was chipped and cracked, so very bumpy at 100kph. It loosened the nut in the Firewall that held the throttle cable in place. It also began to rain...(leaky roof too). \n I hit the LaSalle highway, lifted off and thought \"oh hey, I didn't know they had cruise cntrl in '69 ---- waaaaaaiiit. Cruise control doesn't keep accelerating when you lift off....\" \n So the throttle had now stuck open with 400 poorly timed ponies scrambling to pencil thin 25 year old tires I was heading off to change....in the rain. With a leaking canvas roof. And no wipers. \n So i tap the brakes and BOOM i smell them more than I hear them and the discs at the front are FRIED. Drums at the back are useless anyways. \n What I ended up doing was letting the car accelerate to 150kph, then shutting it off and coasting til I hit 50kph. There were no shoulders so i couldnt stop. When i said 'fuckit its too dangerous' a cop told me to keep moving. When i told him my issue he said 'not my problem, move your car'. \n I made it to my friends. Let it sit in his garage.

            "Growing up, my grandmother owned (still does actually) a MASSIVE track of land in East St. Paul, north of Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. Originally, there was just a log house, then two barns, then a potato barn, two guest houses, and a garage where built. Over time, numerous cars came and went, including an old Westfalia, a Signet, a Buick Roadmaster, an LTD, and....a Firebird.\nOver time, the log house has begun to collapse, the barns have completely folded in on themselves, the two guest houses are also collapsing, and my grandmother built a new house. But the building that remained was the garage. \n I always knew SOMETHING was in that garage, but being little, I could neither see in through the windows, get in through the door, or properly understand the significance of discovering an old car. Last year (May 2012 specifically) my best friend's dad finally finished his 1965 Corvair Corsa. Red. Gorgeous. Convertible. One day they swung by my house and I got a ride. I instantly fell in love with the sound of the engine, the wind in your hair (I had some magnificent blond locks then, still do) and looking up at a canopy of trees shadowing my home street. I decided I had to know what was in that garage. \n Come June 2012. I broke open the door of the garage. Forced the car door open and let the light in. What the light struck was a 1969 Pontiac Firebird 350 Convertible in Sunburst Red. Now, I've driven small European cars all my life, usually in a dark conservative colour.

I followed every instruction to a tee (T?).  Figured for sticktion, even went to the extent of using a caliper to get the most accurate measurements that I could.  I've read that I should be shooting for about 35-40mm of rider sag for the front.  With the preload adjusters all the way in I was seeing 40.5mm without gear.  so maybe I would see 40mm with gear. I can't figure out how that could be.  I'm not particularly light, I don't think the springs have been changed, the bike only has 3000 miles on it, and the last owner was close to my weight. \n Here is how we went about it: \n Pull all of the preload out of the forks.\nBring the wheel off the ground using the triple tree stand, measure full extension.\nTake bike off of the triple tree stand, bounce front forks to settle suspension, compress and release slowly, measure static sag. \nI get on the bike, my buddy compresses the forks and lets them rebound very slowly, take measurement. \nLift bike by forks and let down slowly, take measurement.\nAverage last two measurements, subtract that number from the full extension. \n With the preload completely removed I got 44.5mm of rider sag.  With the adjusters ALL THE WAY IN  I got 40.5mm of sag.  Are these springs too light for me?  I'm not going to give up on this but I feel like I might be doing something wrong.

            "I bought my Apple Watch (Stainless with black sport band) in August after months of contemplating whether or not it'd be a smart call given my admittedly very physically strenuous / potentially damaging to the device job. I work as an aircraft mechanic on [aerial firefighting retardant tankers]( - most of my job is spent in either extreme hot/humid or cold/arid climates, with high risk of smacking the watch into things or scraping it along bits of metal / bolts / you name it. This is part of the reason I went with the SS over the sport - durability. Here's how it's fared.\nWatch band - on my days off I swap to the Milanese Loop and I love it. The black sport band it came with still looks essentially brand new still apart from one area on the clasp side that [looks as though it is beginning to crack]( - I was going to see if Apple would warranty the band but upon further inspection I may have accidentally slightly cut the surface of the band on a cotter pin or some safety wire, so I don't think I could have it warrantied in good conscience. The clasp still works wonderfully, the areas of the band that click into the watch itself still fit very tightly, and there isn't much chance of it slipping off my wrist. \n The body:\nAs expected, many many small scratches all over the SS parts of the watch. Some are more pronounced than others (also to be expected I'd say) - the worst of which is [this particularly hefty scratch on the social button]( I could get those buffing wipes people on here have been getting and it'd probably come right out back to a perfect mirror shine but given my line of work, I think the scratches will stay. \n The digital crown:\nThe only issues I've had with the watch so far have been with the digital crown getting sticky. Sweat, hydraulic fluid, aircraft oils, grease, flying dirt.....you name it, it gets stuck in the digital crown to the point where it won't hardly turn at all. Sometimes it takes me 3-4 rinse-under-water cleanings to get it back to being smooth again (and sometimes even after that it'll be smooth for a few hours and get sticky again). Doesn't hinder the usability of the watch at all, just a minor annoyance/inconvenience. \n The screen:\nThe sapphire crystal screen is still completely flawless. Only complaint is that my dirty mechanic fingers smudge the screen pretty easily but you can't get away from that really. \n In summary, I think I've put this device through much more \"abuse\" than most people in the market for one would normally subject it to, and it's taken it all in stride. I was afraid my line of work wouldn't mesh well with the watch itself, but honestly it's taken quite a few smacks, scrapes, oil/grease baths, and extreme temperatures better than my Seiko (now with custom crystal spiderwebbing) ever did. I have no hesitations wearing it every day in just about every situation (still won't swim or shower with it), although for most decently strenuous tasks I stick to the sport band).

Many GMOs are surrounded with a very high level of control and risk of ecological contamination is not an issue. With some of Monsanto's crops they've been finding they've been hybridizing, as you've stated. \n This raises a couple questions: \n 1) We were wrong about our understanding and ability to engineer genes that prevent this. \n Or \n 2) Monsanto as forgone extra steps (this is an expensive field, no pun intended) to save money and is contaminating genetic diversity. \n While there is probably some degree of both 1 & 2 occurring, the majority of the situation is probably #2. People get all worked up about some kind of ecological holocaust, as you put it. \n Really not that likely. People don't understand how prevalent GMO's are in daily life, how many products come from them.

Monsanto does shitty things and instead of just Monsanto being reprimanded the whole industry of biotechnology suffers. That's an issue. Politicians with no scientific understanding or bribes from companies make decisions that could help millions or billions of people willy nilly. Stem cell research?

Some of those is creates oxidative damage to your cells, which when your cells are constantly being damaged and repaired it increases the chance of receiving a mutation which increases your chance of getting cancer. Cortisol also neutralizes melatonin, the molecule responsible for helping you sleep. Melatonin is also an anti-oxidant and an anti-cancer agent, with lower levels of that you're more cancer prone. Cortisol also makes it difficult for you to metabolize glucose and increases your insulin resistance, which for short bursts may be fine but over any long time period it will cause weight gain and stress on things like your kidneys and pancreas. \nStress and the pathologies related is one of the highest causes of death in the US.": "askscience",

I notice these two girls, both rather large, and both looking MISERABLE. The crowd is doing the normal surge forward, shove back, surge forward, shove back. With each shove back, they would turn around and hit the people behind them screaming and yelling to stop, as if the person behind them was the ONLY one pushing. Obviously, people moved out of the way. It got to the point where I was no directly behind them. So I try to make sure everyone around me has a good time. I'm not a large person, but I can hold my ground. I manage to not surge into them when the crowd does, and in between songs I told them I would try to hold back. They thanked me, so I felt like it was worth it. Then the security was giving out water via waterfalling it from a bottle. They dropped one as the crowd reached for it, splashing these poor women. They screamed at the bouncer, and he just laughed and kept going. Then, Per Almqvist decided it was time to spray the crowd with water via a hose. The crowd ate it up! Well, except the two women.

You don't go with hair like that and leave it down and expect it not to get pulled or caught. I have never been in a crowd full of angry people, but accidents happen, man. My stud meant no harm! Any way, after I decked the lady, she started crying something, and ran off with her friend flipping me off. The security guard asked if I was okay, I laughed and said yeah, and apologized for my reaction, he said it was whatever. The show ended maybe 15 minutes later. I walked out with my friends, and got stopped at the door by security and what I assume was the manager, with these ladies screaming about how I beat her up. Now I didn't hit her hard, but I imagine it may have left a red mark. Nothing permanent. She had CLEARLY gone and slapped herself a bit, because the whole left side of her face was beet red. I hit with a semi closed fist, so the redness would only have been a small area. The manager is telling me I need to wait for police, and all my friends have walked outside without even noticing. I am thinking, \"man, these fucking cunts! I tried to be nice too!\" but thinking whatever, worst case I get an assault charge and spend the night in jail and have to fucking get a ride back to Sacramento the next day and then pay some fines. \n Nope. My knights in shining armor arrived. The security I had spoken to and two others came, and not only corroborated my story, but one of them had been approached by a girl who the other ladies had been hitting during crowd surges and actually broke her nose. The ladies quickly started screaming and hollering about how this was bullshit and they'd never even heard of the bands and just wanted to see a free show and how the venue sucked and blah blah blah. By this time, police had arrived (I assume they were already in the area) and got the correct story. They asked me if I wanted to press charges against the ladies for assault, I laughed and said no I wanna go get a fucking burger. They made me wait around just in case the other girl did and needed me to provide an official statement, but allowed me to go out and talk to my friends, who were still high as well. I accidentally walked away with them, completely forgetting the statement thing. I have no idea how this all resolved other than that.

She is allowed to flirt with whomever she wants, that's life.  I don't know you personally but I imagine there's a girl you've hurt in a similar way. Let me share an experience. \n I once had a friend who was a bigger girl. I had no sexual or emotional attraction to her whatsoever, but she was an amazing friend. We hung out a lot, watched movies and played video games. One day, I bring a girl over to our hangout. she doesn't say anything, but is very clearly upset. The next day I ask what was wrong, and she said I thought you liked me and were going to ask me out, I said no I'm sorry I didn't mean to confuse you, I'm just a flirty person. We stopped being friends and I was very sad about losing her friendship for awhile, but time passed she's happily married and has kids now. She tells me al the time how stupid she feels that she acted that way. we were 14, she didnt know what love was. \n So to reiterate my point. You are infatuated. You sound like you don't like not being able to have things you can't have, and so this girl your friends all get to date and you don't drives you crazy. If it was love, her happiness would be if paramount importance. And as far as the friendzone, that's bullshit. It's a whiny cheap excuse people use to make girls sound bitchy.

Utilities charge per 1kW so it would take 5.5 hours to even hit 1kW and for my utlitiy we charge about 10 cents per kW. So operating at full load a laptop charger would use 4.3kW daily, which is 130KW. So keeping your laptop charger plugged into your laptop at full load would be about $13. \n Average light (say 50W) would take 20 hours to reach 1kW but there is a ton of them in a house and if you have say like 20 through out your house thats 10 cent every single hour if they are turned on.

            "You think paid safari hunting generates more income than all other safari trips? That's an interesting hypothesis but I'm not sure it's true, or just a way to justify big game hunting in the public imaginary. Lets explore this further anyway: \n Firstly hunting in regions are thought to generate around $200 million annually. Now I know what you're thinking, this is Africa and that is a huge sum of money. Well, believe it or not the GDP and tourism industries in the region are significantly larger than people expect, hunting only actually only accounts for around 1.8% of tourist revenues. Furthermore, economists and local conservationists seem to have mixed feelings regarding the corporeal benefits generated by the revenues of trophy hunting, for example, \n 'Local communities seldom benefit from big game hunting: \nWe\u2018re more closely allied with the photographic operators than the hunters. They are finishing off the wildlife before we\u2018ve had a chance to realize a profit from it. Hunters don\u2018t recognize us; they only recognize the government ...25 percent of hunting fees goes into the \u2018hole\u2019 at the district. We\u2018re supposed to get 5 percent: we don\u2018t even see that.' (Sachedina 2008, p152) \n It's also important to examine where this $200 million figure actually comes from. $100m of this estimate is based on an unpublished study by the Professional Hunters Association of South Africa. \n Combine all this with the fact that lions are an internationally recognised vulnerable species, and that their numbers have dwindled by around 30% in the last 20 years, it's fairly easy to see that saying conservation relies upon the hunting industry is entirely spurious. Other forms of safari generate significantly more than this niche form of tourism without causing anywhere near as much damage to the local wildlife.": "Images",

This led to peter's in the 1970s coming up with this claim that all other maps for the past 400 years had been spurious. The problem with that is that a map is only as good as what you intend to use it for. Peter's received critical acclaim because it just so happens to distort the further away one strays from the points of zero distortion. Ie. at higher latitudes shit appears a lot bigger than it really is. So Greenland seems about the same size as Africa on a Mercator, but is actually 14 times smaller. It's just a post-colonial argument really that the Mercator was used as part of a colonial project and the subordination of much of Africa in particular. \n Mercator is a navigational tool... Going into a bit more detail it uses parallel lines of longitude and latitude and the straight lines on the Mercator are loxodromes. Ie. it preserves lines for compass bearing allowing you to navigate. If I wanted to get in my boat and sail from the UK to America all I'd need to do is draw myself a straight line on the map and Mercator accurately will give you a compass bearing to follow. \n Having said that, I have to admit that as a global map Mercator is really quite distorted in terms of area. However, for most purposes the Mercator and universal transverse Mercator are used at regional levels.... I mean how many people do you see going out to sea or traveling large distances using a world map.

            "Well there's a lot of reasons why such events stick to our minds, but really scientifically speaking its impossible to pinpoint why. That's not to say there aren't working models and theories as well as countless experiments in which different senses are stimulated in people leading to the seemingly permanent imprint of some memories or the seeming impermanence of others. From what i understand on the subject, admittedly very little, there's a wide variety of factors some memories feel more permanent, such as the emotions and senses stimulated during the conception of a memory. But the truth is no memories are truly permanent, and even the most vivid ones often change in the minute details. For example you might remember (purely hypothetical) the day your dad took you hiking and what the weather was like the general location etc, but when prompted you would probably not remember the color of the shoes you wore, or the brand of sunscreen you put on that day, however you remember the scented creams you applied smelling faintly of lavender. There are countless studies proving that the sense of smell is one of the strongest senses in relation to memory. \n This being said there are many subconscious and conscious cues at work (far too many) that influence both how the memory was perceptively remembered and the faint factors which lead you to remember that instant over the instant following or preceding it. Generally speaking moments of intense emotion or stimulation of the senses are remembered more vividly. It could also, as in my own case as i find, be personal revelations you may have had about the certain nature of something during the course of some seemingly mundane conversation. Ill give an anecdotal example, say your pet dies suddenly and you are now being consoled by someone when you realize the impermanence of life.

            "I realized yesterday that Friday was roughly the most eventful day I've ever had. \n In the morning I had a couple classes an hour apart. In the second class, Chinese 101, I had a quiz, and I was pretty stressed about it because the characters are pretty easy to screw up. I studied really hard during the hour in-between, then went and took the quiz. I haven't gotten the results yet, but I'm pretty sure it went really well. I think I got everything right. \n After that class ended, I left the building to head back to my dorm. As  I stepped out of the building, I saw that the girl I like (see  this post . We spent the whole of the two hours just talking to each other without it even seeming weird at all, which seems like a good sign in terms of me eventually dating her. \n After she left, I went and ate lunch, then briefly reviewed my stuff for marching band. We had a show yesterday for which I wasn't really very well prepared at that point, but I looked my stuff over and felt better about it. There was an added factor about which I had to worry, though: in our marching band, there is a separate audition for each show, and on Friday was the audition for the show next week. The band is really, really big, so the auditions (done 8 or so people at a time) can take a couple hours, but this time my section was going first. I was literally going to be in the very first row of it. I don't tend to stress out about those auditions, though. \n I went to band practice when it was time, and it was actually really demoralizing. I screwed up a ton of different things in the show, and although I didn't get directly called out or anything, I felt really horrible about how I was doing. At the end of rehearsal I came close to crying or having a little breakdown or something, although honestly I don't think anyone noticed. However, I still had that audition to worry about. \n I pulled myself together really hard for the audition, and I thought it went rather well (especially considering everything). I was, however, still almost sick with concern about the next day's show. That makes it a little surprising in retrospect when I accepted an invitation from one of the other members of my section to go eat at No Thai! (a Thai-inspired restaurant). Five of us went, and getting to the restaurant was a huge hassle for some reason but it all worked out. Two of the people with us boldly decided to try the Dim Mak (\"Death Touch\") spice level with their meal. They actually handled it really well in my opinion. I don't know very well how hot the stuff is, though. \n When I got home, I quickly got to work studying my band stuff so that I wouldn't make a fool out of myself the next day. Remembering the glaring mistakes I had made, I got a grasp on the stuff I hadn't known pretty quickly. While I was studying, though, my ex-girlfriend struck up a conversation with me through Facebook messages. It's a little bit odd when she contacts me, but I totally do want to stay friends with her, so even though it's odd I'm usually happy for it. The weirdest thing, though, is that since we used to date I can't tell if she's just being nice or if she still likes me whenever she compliments me.

(Or whether or not it was actually the same girl, for that matter.) We didn't say anything to each other for the whole class, though, except when I sneezed and she said \"Bless you.\" \n After that class, I went to lunch, and the first thing I had was a plate of macaroni with alfredo sauce. Now, that's not a traditional noodle-sauce combination, but let me tell you, it was mind-blowing. I don't know why, but that was an astounding plate of food. \n Unfortuntately, I hadn't even finished my meal before I started to feel sick. I don't think this had anything to do with the macaroni. I went to leave the cafeteria, and I saw a guy I know, but I was caught up in concern for my health and didn't even acknowledge him. I wish I had waved or something, at least, because I don't know that guy very well and I don't want him to think I'm a jerk or that I don't like him. \n I went to my room and went to sleep, but first I set my alarm, because I had another class in a couple hours.

            "I hate to be  that guy  on /r/AskHistorians, but do you happen to have some quality sources to back up your assertions? I feel slightly better being  that guy , in that your response doesn't actually answer the question as posted. \n I ask specifically because it seems to me to contain a conflation of Wikipedia-driven a-historical information along with some '90s received wisdom that's contradicted by a variety of sources from the '50s-'70s. \n To be more specific, the byte (as the smallest addressable unit) predates the common usage of an 8-bit byte. Additionally, the 8-bit byte predates 8-bit character encoding. Additionally, the hypothesis that an expanded character encoding expanded the byte size seems wildly against history. As an example, look at the BCPL reference manual from 1967. It doesn't define a byte (as that's implementation and hardware dependent) but all of the examples use a 6-bit byte. Look at the 6th C reference manual, which defines both bytes and characters as being 8-bits, but explicitly says that characters \"occupy the right-most seven bits of an 8-bit byte.\" Pretty much look at anything from the late '60s and early '70s, and you'll see a hodge-podge headed towards 8-bit bytes. And where you don't (like with the PDP-8's 6-bit bytes (introduced after the introduction of both 7-bit ASCII and 8-bit EBCDIC)) you'll see things humming forward and just using multiple bytes for characters. Which should sound familiar to anyone using Unicode. \n On top of that, you assert that \"IBM's personal computer became the standard in early computing and ever since the 8 bit byte system has been standard.\" I find that claim to be something I'd very much like a source on, my understanding is that the 8-bit byte was widely standardized by nearly every hardware manufacturer from DEC to IBM well before there was such a thing as a \"personal computer\" (yes, including the Altair 8800.) \n Also, anyone who's calling out character encoding and doesn't call out EBCDIC and System/360...I immediately want to know what sources they're reading.": "AskHistorians",

            "If I might expand a little bit on what may well be going wrong... \n It's a common complaint that R* should have known how many people were going to be trying to play on the launch day and should have acted accordingly. While I'm not about to absolve them of responsibility, the simple fact is that even if they went out of their way and did everything correctly, they could still be fucked. \n Let's take a hypothetical. Let's assume that they did simulated load testing. Let's say that they took \"typical beta test behavior\", scaled it up to X% the number of copies sold. By that I mean programming something that acted, from a network point of view, like some unholy number of PS3s. Each of the \"virtual\" programmatic PS3s sends requests with the frequency a beta tester would (Finished a mission? Save it. Get robbed? Save it. Increased a stat? Save it.) \n They could well have done that and had everything go swimmingly. But here's where shit can go wrong. \n Let's say that they assumed a single character creation per player. If you haven't created a character yet, you're selecting a bunch of things that determine the look and skills of your character. Now let's assuming that the act of creating a character tied to your PS3 account is very expensive. By that I mean it imposes a large load on the network, the computational resources or the backing store. \n It's OK that it's expensive though, because R* thought of everything! They used the data on how frequently people created a new character and their infrastructure can totally handle it! \n Launch day comes, and suddenly there's little issues. The testing environment is different from the real world. Talking to Sony's PSN servers has an extra second of lag per request over the locally tested fake PSN servers. Ok, so load balancing has to get swizzled around, no biggie! This is a solvable engineering problem! We've got this, baby! \n And then, while shit is stacking up, and frustrated players keep quitting the game and restarting, it hits the OPs team like a ton of frozen dung: every time someone fails to connect, they quit out and make another character. That super expensive thing that was anticipated to happen once per new user? Now that's happening several if not dozens of times per anticipated player.

            "The short answer is that it very much depends on the curriculum of the institution. \n In terms of undergraduate education, I'll generalize:  In Computer Science, the software is about the academics. In Software Engineering, the academics is about the software. \n Please keep in mind my academic experience was back in the day where the cross-over point when deciding on an academic path was between Computer Science and Computer Engineering (or straight-up Electrical Engineering and choosing all of the computery elective stuff). In those cases, the Computer Science department was generally awkwardly crammed inside of the Mathematics department and the Computer Engineering department was generally stuffed into the Electrical Engineering department. That structure meant that CE students took some classes in the CS department, and CS students took some classes in the CE department. \n Depending on how any given institution  started  departments for various computational things, they then had to make decisions on how to continue once nearly everyone figured out that this stuff wasn't going away in the late 80s/90s and they needed a more permanent solution than what they had. \n Some institutions mashed CS into their EE/CE programs. Some doubled down on the academic nature of CS and (to resist becoming trade schools) shoved their CS departments even further into the math side, while having some \"compromise\" programs like Information Management Systems, IT something or another, or Software Engineering. Regardless, some mix'n'match thing went on, and it's likely very difficult to compare degree titles without looking at the actual curriculum. \n My advice would be to look at what you actually  want to do.  Then assume you're going to be 30% wrong about that. Look at the various programs at the various schools and look at the requirements. Look for how much leeway you have in those requirements. Look at the dependency trees for the classes involved. Hell, if you want, use the requirements and dependencies to properly, actually analyze the number of routes you could take to graduate and where the choke points are. \n Take that knowledge and figure out which programs give you the most flexibility to learn different things. You will (hopefully) find something in your first few years that you want to do a deep-dive on. The freedom to, say, burrow through the undergraduate classes on a certain topic and take a graduate level class or three your last few years is a hell of a way to go, if the program allows it. \n That was sort of a tangent and doesn't directly address your question but...still...seriously, chose a program with some flexibility, whichever way you go. \n That went a little sideways on me in terms of a straight-up answer, but I hope it's helpful.

            "Javeed appeared in the first episode as the CEO of some implausibly named tech company. What happened to Javeed was that he reverse-vested in an trigger-lacking way. Which sounds non-nonsensical, but allow me to attempt an explanation. \n First, let's do vesting real quick. As part of your compensation package, you might be promised, let's say, 4,000 shares in the company you're joining. Those shares might \"vest\" over 4 years. Meaning that if you leave the company after 3 years, you only walk away with 3,000 shares. Depending on how the vesting schedule is written, there can be a load of different outcomes and percentages, but let's just simplify it as 25% of your shares \"vest\", as in are actually yours, per year. It's done that way to try to retain employees, since you can't just hire someone, hand them stock, and pray they stick around long enough to do something useful. \n So, let's talk triggers! Triggers are just a fancy way of referring to contract stipulations that are  triggered  by certain conditions. Let's say you were employee #1 of a start up. You've got your stock that vests over 4 years. The start up does so well that it gets bought 2 years into your employment. Now, you're only 1/2 vested. However, a pretty standard trigger in a startup contract would stipulate that if the company gets bought, you instantly become fully vested. Hurrah, now you have all of your stock, and you get to fully cash out! \n Now let's talk about reverse vesting. Reverse vesting sucks. This can be a stipulation of a new investor when the company seems desperate, there are key people the new investor doesn't want to risk losing, and it's a douche move. Can you tell if I'm a tech guy or a VC yet? At any rate, the new investor comes in and their terms include that certain key people reverse vest. That means, they take the stock they've already vested and they put it, essentially, in escrow. Then, they start on a new vesting schedule. The purpose of this is to keep those key people from wandering off with their vested stock, and leaving the investor high and dry. If those key people leave before the vesting period, they don't get their shares...like it's not enough that the new investor is diluting these poor fucks that built the damn thing, they have to....anyway, moving along. \n So, let's combine the two. Let's say someone like Javeed the CEO reverse vests as a term of a new round of investment. Ok, so now all of Javeed's stock is locked up, and not his until he re-vests, AKA stays around for another 4 years. Right now, he's holding nothing but a contract. \n Now, imagine that the board, investors, stockholders, etc. all agree that it's safer to sell the whole company off to someone. Here's where the combination of reverse vesting and triggers come into play. Let's go to the quote: \n > Richard: An acquisition of $200 million, right? \n > Javeed: Yeah, they all made out. I had reverse vest with no triggers. Then I lost all of my shares when they fired me. \n What that means is that he gave up all of his shares and had to go through vesting again. He also didn't have a trigger that fully vested his reverse vested stock on acquisition. That last sentence sucked, but let's hope the previous explanation makes it somewhat clear. Then they shit-canned him, and he didn't have a trigger to vest on termination either. \n That's all to say, he got fucked. Fucked in a way even the smartest of fuckers could get fucked.

It really feels more like \"this is magic but the Doctor wants to make it feel sciencey\" or \"let's use scientific phrases to explain magic\" because it would somehow take Doctor Who over the edge to have \"magical\" aliens. \n The \"science that appears as magic based on spoken words\" should still not be able to spontaneously produce water in a person's lungs, regardless of if the \"DNA replication module\" is plunged in water or not.  (How does \"DNA replication\" somehow able to drown or harm a person?  Saying that it's science doesn't make it make any more sense other than to say that it's not out of place in a sci-fi show because it's technically not fantasy.) \n And heck, if nothing else, the \"science\" should either work in all (or at least more) contexts (which it doesn't, obviously) or shouldn't work at all for those not versed in it (trying to name things without having any \"technology\" to back up the power or not having to vocalize in a certain way). \n It's more reasonable to me that there's something unknown about an underground area that a certain few have been able to put together and pinpoint (heck, and use for personal gain) than it is to suddenly, for one episode, have a race of aliens who can  essentially  work magic and have it be called a primitive \"science\" that is never really referenced or visited again. \n Heck, even the Sarah Jane Adventures's \"Secrets of the Stars\" story (where there's power to the Zodiac) makes more sense to me than The Shakespeare Code because it explains why this only works at this time and would never be possible again.  I mean, with all the Doctor's knowledge and Martha's curiosity, wouldn't it make sense that they would be able to find some way to use the \"science\" of the Carrionites to their advantage in another story?": "gallifrey",
            "Okay, so I was listening to a podcast discussing the newest Christmas episode and I might have realized why Amy Pond and, by extension, Rory, have become such mainstays of the past two and a half series of Doctor Who. It's a little bit of a leap, but hear me out... \n During the ending of The Big Bang, when Amy re-creates the universe, Amy remembers the Doctor back into existence. \n We all remember this scene if we saw it--Amy sees River, she notices the TARDIS journal, and she remembers the Doctor-- HER  Raggedy Doctor. \n She doesn't just call him back into being, she calls him home. \n She doesn't ask him to come, she scolds him for being late to her wedding. And her specific invocation for bringing back the Doctor and the TARDIS, the words that finish bringing them back into being? \n Something old. Something new.\nSomething borrowed. Something blue. \n Now, Amy initially speaks these words while trying to describe the TARDIS--but how well does this describe The Doctor himself? He is old, but re-created to be something new. He might be a person, but time with him is only borrowed, not forever. And what is the Eleventh Doctor eternally? Blue. Sad. Especially over his loss of the Ponds at the end of the Angels Take Manhattan. \n Wait, that last part ended up being tangential, but I like it so I'm leaving it in. \n Anyways, when he shows up he's just the way that Amy would want him at the wedding: dressed up and ready to go. And when she brings the Doctor back, Rory remembers... everything. He's not only Rory, he's Rory and the Lone Centurion. He's better than just plain old Rory. \n Anyways, when this happens, Amy imprints the need to return into the Doctor. He isn't just the Doctor--he's Amy's Doctor. He can't quit the Ponds until they won't let him back anymore, and even the departure is difficult.\nWhat isn't said, though (because it isn't realized within the confines of the series), is that it is not only because of the potential paradox of running into the Ponds after knowing that the end of that adventure is \"The Final Farewell\" but also since Amy actually wishes him away forever--she lets go of him, she rejects any further experience with him. And The Doctor falls into a depression because he has lost his newest and literalest raison d'\u00eatre (literally \"reason to be\" or \"reason of being\").": "gallifrey",
            "So those of us who've seen Enchanted know that much of the action is precipitated by the evil storybook future stepmother in law Nerissa, but why not notice why Nerissa is in Giselle's life and how Giselle herself seems to enchant everything around her? \n At the beginning of the movie, Giselle sings about finding her mate for live through \"true love's kiss\" and shortly thereafter is joined by a handsome prince.  I know it is meant to be Classic Disney Timing, but it seems a little too easy even considering that it happens only minutes into the movie. \n It is worth pointing out that Giselle seems to live alone, with little human contact, and is almost definitely not a princess throughout the story. \n Anyway, Giselle gets engaged to Prince Edward and sent into the \"real world\" where things are not so straightforward as they are in the animated land she knows by Queen Narissa.  Twice we see what happens when she sings in the \"real world\": she magically communicates with the animals and gets them to help her with the housework (all of which she is familiar with despite having no reason to know about laundry detergent based on her previous surroundings) and gets an entire park to help her teach Robert to express affection to his girlfriend. \n Robert himself doesn't seem to be too intensely into the scenes and remarks how uncomfortable he is with such actions, though he must be bewitched in some way because he never questions the sudden travel or change in actions during \"How Do You Know.\" \n Giselle learns about the new world's ideas of romance and, though scoffing at them at first, begins to adopt them while expecting that they are incompatible with the world she had known--creating a rift between her and Edward, who she would expect to be bad at dating. \n She falls in love with Robert, who she had been slowly influencing this entire time, and she gets rid of any kind of remorse she might feel about breaking Robert and Nancy up and breaking up with Edward by making Nancy into the kind of girl she used to be.  Almost literally.  Nancy, who used to be a bit more practical and self-reliant, is now simply looking for a husband through her own \"true love's kiss\" and runs off with Edward to Andalasia where she becomes an animated character and shrugs away any remaining links to her \"real world\" existence. \n And Giselle has a successful business almost immediately. \n Outside of Disney Logic shrugs, what other explanation can there be?": "FanTheories",
            "Okay, so I was rechecking through the Pokedex because I was watching a Nuzlocke run and I was thinking about how, recently, I read that the smallest pokemon was Joltik (at 4\").  Most of the time when I think about pokeballs I imagine their diameter to be 3\"-5\"--much smaller than a Voltorb (around 1'7\" or 1'8\"). \n How could people confuse Voltorbs, at such a large comparative size, with a pokeball? \n Well... Perhaps a while ago, pokeballs were of a larger size.  In our world, the physical size of computers and many similar items have been shrinking with their development while their capacities and their abilities have increased significantly.  Perhaps pokeballs used to be significantly larger (needing more size for larger pokemon at that technology level), coming close to the size of Voltorbs.  According to Bulbapedia's page on  Pokeballs . \n The main reason Voltorbs wouldn't be considered to have developed until more modern times?  Probably because of the color scheme developed for the main pokeballs hadn't come out yet.  Until the colors were truly standardized, the Voltorbs wouldn't really have much to go by, but once they saw something they could recognize, they developed a similar camouflage.  I know it's a game mechanic, but the \"item\" containers that you can see on the screen while scrolling look like giant pokeballs--perhaps the larger pokeballs are still used (or their likeness is used) for packaging of gifts or products.": "pokemonconspiracies",
            "Okay, so I'm going to do my best to avoid mixing up the books and the TV series (since I'm much more familiar with the book series than the TV version, and the books do a much better job of making this a clearer topic--though in a very fantasy-ish way). \n Harry saw Dexter displaying common \"symptoms\" of what people who later became serial killers did as children--torturing and killing animals, having a difficult time fitting in....  He was worried that Dexter was going to fall into a similar pattern (and, to be fair, he did).  He figured that darling Dexter's descent was inevitable and he decided that his only chance to live a \"normal\" life was to separate his kills from the rest of his life. \n What becomes an issue is the training--how Dexter was taught to fit in, how Dexter was taught to see himself as \"other,\" and how Dexter learned to identify his proper kills.  (In the book this is not so much an issue--Dexter's Dark Passenger allows him to recognize the proper type of darkness in another and put that to rest, and the Dark Passenger itself is a separate being.  Dexter has a difficult time killing without his Dark Passenger tagging along.) \n In fact, he genuinely feels for other characters but tries to convince himself that he can't really, for example, be in love with Rita because she's just his cover.  That's a huge part of his inner monologue--\"these people,\" \"people,\" \"not like them\" all show up a lot but he seldom thinks of himself as part of a group of people.": "FanTheories",
            "I know.  I mean, I think that Eleven's tenure has been a lot of nods, but it shouldn't be appreciated purely for that.  The thing that I find about the past two and a half seasons is that it's at the same time more positive and darker than much of its predecessor, in a path similar to the original series (which had a deep darkness overshadowed by some of the sillier aspects).  I haven't watched all of the Doctors yet--that probably won't happen until the rest of my regular shows wrap up for a bit--but I've watched a few episodes here and there of the First, Second, Fourth, and Seventh Doctors (as well as New Who's Nine through Eleven so far) and part of the issue is also the fact that Doctor Who has grown so much since the rejuvenation of the series. \n The cheapest of Ninth Doctor tales was still leagues above the old series in terms of spending and production value.  Then again, that's because we have changed a lot (both sides of the pond, of course) and there was a new paradigm to contend with.  Hour-long episodes are now the norm, as are significant production values.  Having worked in film and television on and off the past two years, I have to admit I was surprised how quickly they were able to put together classic episodes of Doctor Who when reading  Elisabeth Sladen: An Autobiography .  Her shock at coming back and seeing how different everything was during the Russell T Davies era was significant. \n That said, what excites me with the nods is that I feel like it will make the Fiftieth Anniversary more memorable and exciting--even if they can't work all the previous Doctors in, they can make references.  Then again, I'm one of the few people who appreciate the Tim Burton Dark Shadows film for the references (yes, it is a HUGE trainwreck as far as writing and characterization goes, but there are SO MANY great nods to the series and it's so  PRETTY! ). \n Perhaps in the transition to a new companion and that being in conjunction with the fiftieth anniversary of Who, we'll maybe get a transition back towards things being more Classic.  The Pond Era is very much Moffat making his mark on Doctor Who and changing it from the Davies era. \n One can only hope. \n (Also, I think the ironic thing about the \"coolness\" is that it's inherently cheesy--the Doctor is so focused on X thing being \"cool\" that you know it can't really be cool.  It's almost a meta thing.) \n Edited to include": "gallifrey",
            "My concern is that Jafar wanted to take his actual control over most areas of concern and just make himself visible initially (wanting to be Sultan himself) but he immediately jumped to wanting more power than any person should have. \n The Sultan, for all intents and purposes, is a figurehead who provides good morale to the sultanate.  Jafar is the advisor who makes most of the significant decisions but does not seem to trust the Sultan to do his job of being a figurehead.  He wants to ensure that he makes  all  decisions.  However, as a sultan he will do the same thing that he fears the current Sultan is doing: making his own decisions and ignoring the best advice of the court Vizier. \n Jasmine and Aladdin stand in Jafar's way only in that Jafar wants to be sultan himself.  Ideally, Aladdin would become sultan and still listen to an educated Vizier. I imagine some scribe would have been second in line for the Vizier title, and thus would have been thea (more) ideal candidate for this position and would rise up similarly to advise Aladdin.  Unless the advice given by this advisor were completely against Aladdin's experience, the resulting decisions and declarations would likely be the wise ones.": "FanTheories"

            "I am an avid redditor, but almost deleted my account because of all the hate and ridicule Christianity gets in today's modern society, especially on platforms like reddit. I gave reddit a second chance when I stumbled upon this subreddit and am so glad to be apart of it. I thought I was the only Christian/Republican on this entire social medium. I was just curious what your thoughts are as fellow brothers and sisters in regards to society today and how accepting it is of so many wrong things? Don't get me wrong, like the rest of us am no saint. I drink beer and slip in terms of cursing at times but I have unwavering faith. My story begins about three days ago revolving around the \"Caitlin Jenner\" issue... \n I began to see a ton of Facebook posts both on extremely polar opposite ends of the spectrum in terms of opinion. I saw one article that peeked my interest from a married family woman denouncing Jenner as a 'hero'. It explained that getting rich and famous for something that does not affect or help someone else is not what it means be a \"hero\". She then cited scripture and exclaimed her faith. I posted the article to my wall with the title \"I fear for my children's future\" (I don't have any, I'm a 24 year old recent graduate). I received so much persecution and ridicule over not only my faith, but even close friends of mine said they questioned my ability to be a father one day just because I planned to give my kids a foundation on the Bible. I was utterly appalled at my friends and some family's comments and Facebook messages.. Some even sent threats and hoped my children would turn our gay, transgender, or as sociopaths.. I did not mean to start a battle of religion, but merely to weigh in on how I viewed the issue just as everyone else did. Just because I believe in God and think it is wrong I was all of a sudden \"ignorant\"... \n I would have loved to stick to my guns and stay strong (defend my beliefs) but the more I fought against the comments the worse they became. I eventually took it down for the sole reason that I am looking for full time employment in the field of public relations and I don't want any employers to see me as a \"controversial\" or \"close minded\" person. Drama is not a good thing in my particular field. I was deeply bothered by this.. I guess the point of this post is to see how you guys feel in regard to the whole situation?

            "So I rewatched the season 9 finale for a second time, and after some heavy thought I think I came up with a satisfactory conclusion. At least in my eyes. You may hate it, you may love it. But I feel obliged to share and hear my fellow Redditor opinions. So here goes...\nDean wakes up a demon. For the beginning of the season we get to explore \"the dark side\" and what it looks like through the eyes of someone like Dean as well as witness his internal conflict with his old self, and new self (being the very creature he despised and was trained to kill). For a while we get to see demon dean doing demon things all the while Sammy and Cas try to figure it out and help him through it (as expected I his two best amigos). They decide to ultimately...you already know what I'm gonna say...ahh yes, find God. So that becomes the primary focus of the season. To find God bc the de-demonization spell doesn't work in Deans mark of Cain situation and the only way it can be reversed is by finding the High and Mighty. In doing so Cas can be an angel again and no longer a leader like he wanted, heaven will go back to normal, Dean can be fixed, and Sammy can have his bro back and split some pie.\nSo during the search for God Sam Cas and Dean (still struggling with dark feelings and urged) is being manipulated and persuaded by Crowley to keep \"howling at the moon\" with him, as they are both very much the same. Both confused due to being half human and demon, one clinging to his lost humanity, and one clinging to his lost demon-ish-ness. So Dean does his best to stay loyal to his best angel buddy Cas and brother Sam, but eventually our favorite king of hell drops him a little intel. Intel that a knight of hell is obligated to hear and follow. The anti-Christ is now on the rise (that's right folks the kid Sam and Dean left behind in season 5, Jessie Turner). This information would be dropped close to mid season finale.\nThe next half of season ten we see the rise of Turner who got his powers back granted by Crowley the again newly crowned king of hell and they plan on embarking on taking over creation without Lucifer in the cage. Hear comes the big dilemma. A knight of hell MUST follow this line of command. It's in his blood. As much as he tries to refuse his destiny (much like Sam earlier upon letting Lucy into his meat suit) he is compelled to do the opposite. So now Dean is again confused and struggling with his inner, now Exterior, demon whilst Sam and Cas get closer to finding God. They finally find him somehow (and he is obviously played by some amazing actor like Micheal Rosenbaum or someone that can match and contrast Mark Pelligrino's acting as Lucifer). He knew Sam Dean and Cas were going to find him all along and that all of what has unfolded these 10 seasons were all apart of the big plan. Now as inch closer to the big bad finale we see that Dean has ultimately chosen sides with Turner and Crowley and and a battle is again brewing between demonhood and angel hood. On the lighter side we have Sam, Cas, Gabriel who really wasn't dead (as teased earlier in season 9) and all of the Heavenly Host (including Bobby).\nThe season 10 finale. With many \"feels\" and amazingly epic moments we come to the most important showdown in Supernatural history. After finding God he informs Sam and Cas that nothing can be done about Deans situation and only he can change his destiny. That pisses sam and Cas off and they get mad and try to \"yell\" or throw a fit in Gods face. Here we get to see how Divine and Awesome the one true God is and he shows the his true power with some of the most amazing special effects Supernatural has to offer. This convinces Sam and the gang to trust his Word and confront Crowley, Turner, and his brother. So the day approaches and the second part of the finale begins.\nDean and the dark side face Sam and the light side (the ultimate contrast to season 5 where we see things flipped for the boys) and a huge battle with epic speeches takes place on some holy ground place, probably a field in Kansas...just saying. From here both heaven and hell open up above and below and an epic brawl breaks out. As things come to a climax we see it all boils down to Dean. With the audience convinced Hell has won, dean suddenly winks at Sam with tears in his eyes above him and we again see flashbacks of all the bro outs and family/brotherly moments of the show. Again silence occurs as the epic battle around them no longer matters, and he whispers \"bitch\" jokingly as only Dean Winchester and Jensen Ackles could do, and pulls the 1st blade on Turner thus ending his reign and finishing the battle. All of a sudden Sam and Dean are transported into a room of white where they sit in front of God himself. From here the ending could go two ways...\n1.) they are either told they are dead and this time they are to stay dead by God himself as they have successfully completed their roles. As God steps back into the picture and fixes everything above and below (on earth and heaven). Ending scene, Sam, Dean, Bobby, John and Cas all drinking in a bar with everyone else who has died such as their half brother.\n2.) After a long and epic discussion God declares he really is tired of things and wants to retire officially. He bestows Sam with all of his Power and Might in a real Bruce almighty moment to which sam accepts and is yet still confused by. It is then revealed that that is why he was the one to undergo the trials in the first place, to cleanse him and ultimately lead him here. Crowley is forgiven as God touches him and he becomes fully human again with a second chance to redeem his however many hundreds of years of evil. In his place Dean is named the king of hell with Lucy in the cage and Turner dead, he is the only viable option. However in doing all this the boys know they will never see each other again. More intense tear jerking flashbacks as the boys shake on it and hug before accepting their new roles in the afterlife.\nI think if the writers take the time to out some serious though and effort into this next and LAST season we are gonna have something epic and beautiful, even if it's nothing like what I came up with.

But in general actors tend to act in their genre. \n Especially with sci-fi because usually people that watch sci-fi shows are sci-fi buffs and have seen things like Star Trek and Stargate and such.

Glad I didn't cause it might have spoiled it.": "MrRobot",
            "No, I don't think they would put such a big thing (The Seventh Slap) in a situation like that.  The Slap Bet is one of the most important things in the show (ever since Season Two) possibly second (debatable) only to the Mother herself.  Future Ted would have told that story when he was telling the events of 2012.  If they did do Slapsgiving 3 (Which I totally hope they do) it would be 2013. \n Although one theory I thought of that would be a nice touch would be at Barney and Robin's wedding reception(we know it gets at least that far because of the scene where we see the Mother playing bass), Marshall gets up to give a toast and as his wedding present to Barney he slaps him twice, freeing Barney of his fears of being slapped anymore.": "HIMYM"

            "Okay, so, here's my theory. Apologies if this has already been discussed but I didn't see it here anywhere yet. \n The Kappa Kappa Tau sisters from 1995 are the mothers of several of the main characters in the storyline right now, including the Chanels and Grace. If you look at the 1995 sisters, they all correspond visually to characters we see in the present day. The bitchy ringleader (WaterfallsIsMyJam!Girl) is a dead ringer for Chanel #5-- they look almost exactly alike. The blonde with the shorter hair looks like Chanel #3. The other blonde with the longer hair not only looks like Chanel Oberlin but her name is Coco. (After the IRL Coco Chanel.) This might suggest that she's Chanel #1's mom. Amy-- the sister who tries to help Sophia-- bears a resemblance not only to Chanel #2/Ariana Grande but to Charisma Carpenter. Then, there's Sophia... \n Sophia looks for all the world like a younger version of Gigi. On a show where bodies disappear and people who are supposed to be dead could possibly still be alive, it's maybe possible that Sophia only  looked  dead. Bear in mind that we don't ever see anyone actually test the theory-- we only hear Amy tell the other sisters when they came back that she tried to shut Sophia's eyes but they wouldn't move. (Which I'm also fairly sure is not something that happens when someone's just died, btw.) \n Let's say that Sophia was being targeted by the Red Devil back in 1995 and to keep her and her baby safe, Dean Munch, Mrs. Bean and Amy hatch a plan to fake Sophia's death after the baby is born. Sophia is so traumatized by what's happened to her that she remains stuck in the 90s and is mentally a little off and in no shape to raise the baby. Mrs. Bean arranges for the baby to be given to her father, who is Wes. (Dean Munch stays clear of this part of the plan, which is how it appears that she and Wes had not really met prior to the pilot. She doesn't want anyone but necessary people to know she covered it up.) \n Wes tells Grace when she gets a little older that she's a year or two younger than she actually is and that her mother died in a fire when she was two. This almost has to be the case based on what we know so far because the only picture saved from the fire is (bizarrely enough) one of Grace's mom with her sorority sisters. It's more likely that that was the only picture Wes had of Sophia, period, because he barely knew her before he got her pregnant in 1995. This is all a part of a lot of theories I've seen on here and there's the playlist and blah blah. \n This is then why Gigi is so into Wes. Wes thinks Sophia is dead and it's been 20 years so it doesn't occur to him that Gigi could  be  Sophia. He just sees a woman who is his type and is into mixtapes and fails to recognize Gigi as his daughter's mother. \n This is also why Dean Munch is so cool with Gigi-- she knows who she really is-- and why she tells Wes that she knows that the Red Devil won't target Grace. Since Grace is the tub baby, the Red Devil (one of them, anyway) is apparently on a revenge quest for what happened in 1995. That sets it up so that it looks like Dean Munch believes that the Red Devil is Gigi. She tells Wes that Grace will be safe because she knows Gigi would never hurt her own daughter. Obviously, there is more than one Red Devil but I definitely think the current Kappa Kappa Tau sisters are the daughters of the 1995 sisters.": "ScreamQueensTV",
            "Forgive me if this has already come up but I didn't see it anywhere. I haven't seen anyone talking about the most likely reason why Hester isn't actually dead and that's that she has been dead already the whole time. Hester is the ultimate horror movie trope-- she's a ghost. Now, see how this could explain why we keep wanting to connect her to the Red Devils in the present but how we really should have been trying to connect her to Kappa in the past. We knew there had to be a big twist with Hester and I think it's that she's actually Gigi's mom. \n Why would they have Lea Michele play the girl in the '50s story if not to imply that maybe they're either strongly related or-- better for a horror movie-- the same person? Yeah, we didn't see her die then as she was saved from the meat hook killer by the guy in the truck. But what if the '50s girl is a former Kappa who had a baby and died and then has been cursing Kappa ever since? She's tied into Debbie, the girl who hung herself at the Radwell compound after being very Hester-like in her behavior. \n Either Hester's bloodline is cursed and that's why Sophia died or Gigi is her daughter, which is why they look so much alike. It might even explain why Gigi is so prone to revenge-- not just for her dead friend but for her exiled Kappa pledge mom who killed herself and now haunts Kappa House. \n This could also explain why Hester only seems to alternately need her neck brace, is an easy liar, is obsessed with Chad, and fakes being pregnant. Even though it's tough to make her a Red Devil because she always seems to be where they aren't, she's also never attacked by one because the actual Red Devils all know who and what she really is.": "ScreamQueensTV",
            "In interviews for the final season, Fellowes is quoted a bunch saying that he told Rob James-Collier to be ready for Thomas to be the \"tragic hero\". We've seen a lot of the tragic but I'm not quite sure we've seen enough of the heroic and, in the final episode, that might mean something big for Thomas. It would be very classic storytelling to have Thomas be the one who basically saves Downton Abbey from some terrible fate. He looks totally happy with himself and wherever he's headed in the CS trailer and that's a huge change since the last couple of episodes. They only have one episode to get him there and I think they've been building towards Thomas taking some kind of action that allows him to let go of any guilt he has towards past actions and gives the other characters a completely infallible reason to trust him. Pretty much nothing shy of saving the Abbey is going to do this. \n You could then ask: but why does the Abbey need saving and how could Thomas save it, even if he wants to? Considering that it's the final episode, we know the big theme is going to be that the world has changed in such a way that a lot of the main characters are exiting Downton Abbey. Anna buying a hair dryer for Lady Mary seems to suggest that she & Bates are planning on leaving. Edith is going to marry Bertie and move to Brancaster. The only one who appears to be staying put is Lady Mary. But consider that this is a terrible ending ahead of a potential movie in the future-- there has to be at least one source of conflict you can still mine from the Crawley family and Lady Mary's romantic life is as much the backbone of Downton Abbey as the abbey itself is. This is why Lady Mary just married a guy really wrong for her but what if it's he more than just really wrong for her? What if, really, he's a total hustler trying to swindle Mary and George out of their money? \n Look at some potential suggestions for this in the story... The first is that the plot doesn't ask for us to care about Henry much at all. The show sells us hard on Bertie Pelham but doesn't actually do much of anything to get us to like Henry. It seems almost purposefully set up to make us feel like Mary was pressured by everyone around her into marrying this guy because everyone else's issues caused them to arrive at a point where they thought it was a great idea. We see more of Mary's independent spirit when in how she subtly approves of and is jealous over Edith's London life during the season than when she chooses again to be married, which seems to then squash that side of her, leading us to feel like this marriage was not a very good idea. Most importantly, though, is that Henry comes pre-packaged with everything he'd need as a character to be a swindler. He has no money but he's vain, chilly and ambitious. He has a risk-taking personality (the car racing) which, for all we know, could go hand-in-hand with a gambling problem and a massive heap of debts that no one looked into much because of the whirlwind romance. He has a connection to the Crawleys in Lady Shackleton but he himself is said over and over again to have little in the way of money or prospects. He's  obsessed  with Mary-- not hearing her say no, showing up on her doorstep with a marriage license and convincing her to get married that weekend. Poor Tom has no idea, obviously-- he just sees a dashing, working class, and slightly uppity guy and says 'perfect for Mary!' (and for Tom, who also misses Matthew and having a BFF brother-in-law.) Let's say that Henry Talbot has his eyes on the Crawley family fortune and is working a long con to get it. This would have been foreshadowed by plots in previous seasons-- Lady Rosamund's beau working with the maid to get at her late husband's money and \"Patrick Gordon\" showing up to try to get at the fortune. In both cases, Crawley women were grieving the loss of a man they loved and were succeptible to manipulation. It could be that now it's Mary's turn. Here's where Thomas comes in. \n Thomas is ever-loyal to Lady Mary and George and Mary knows that. He's also the most oddly objective member of the household, so if he were to overhear something that indicated that Henry weren't on the up-and-up, Mary would be inclined to at least listen to him. Thomas is also good with a great scheme and it's not Downton without one last Thomas scheme. This time, he saves the Abbey but this, as we've noticed, doesn't change the fact that Lady Mary is married to a criminal. This could result in Mary continuing a pattern of modernity and becoming the first person in her family to get a divorce. She's no stranger to scandal and it would call back to the first episode of the final season, when she's threatened with exposure of her private life and instead of fearing it, she tells that woman to go ahead and do her worst.": "DowntonAbbey",
            "Okay, so, when Ali and Rollins got married, they suddenly went away for a few days to what is undoubtedly the first place anyone thinks of when they think 'hot honeymoon getaway'-- a B&B in Amish country. We didn't see a ton of what happened here. We saw the bit with the stairs and the beginnings of Rollins' torturing of Ali. (Now that we know that Rollins was so into Charlotte, the stairs thing makes more sense-- it's a sort of perverted revenge for what Cece said Ali did to the girl at the frat house that got Cece kicked out of UPenn.) Anyway, we don't see the rest of their trip. Then, recently, Hanna and Aria went to the same village and encountered Eliza. \n Because they were tracking Rollins and Eliza had creepy Charlotte dolls of the Liars, we agree with Hanna and Aria's interpretation of what's going on here and that's that Rollins brought Charlotte here and, for whatever reason, Charlotte has been playing with this little girl and giving her the dolls. I'm not so sure that Charlotte was the one who had been visiting the community with Rollins over the last five years. I think Ali was. Why would Ali spend time in Amish country with some kid and give her Charlotte's dolls, you ask? Because Eliza is Ali's daughter. \n Remember when Ali had what she told Cece was a pregnancy scare the summer before she disappeared? What if she actually was pregnant and that was part of her desperation? Ali was afraid of the baby's father and the implication was always that Board Shorts was the father-- only the Liars decided that Board Shorts was Ezra, whom we know didn't sleep with Ali. They stopped looking for Board Shorts when they uncovered that Ezra had a relationship with Ali but, in the process, they never figured out who could have been the father of her baby. It might be Ian, Wilden, or possibly Wren (I love that clue someone uncovered about Wren wearing board shorts in the series pilot) but whoever it is, Ali was afraid of him and she ran. \n This is why Ali in the early flashbacks is worried about things like money and her family's will. She's pregnant and she's trying to find a way to escape. She makes a plan to fake her death to get away from A and the baby's father, who terrify her. We never see much of what happened to Ali when she was on the run, just the bits with Cyrus and that she had Mrs. Grunwald who could help her. At some point after she fakes her death, Ali has a daughter and names her Eliza because she's obsessed with Audrey Hepburn movies, apparently. Without the ability to take care of her child and worried that she could be in danger, Ali gives her baby to the people in Amish country and continues on the run. \n This is also why Ali stays in Rosewood before the time jump when, really, you'd have to think why the hell would anyone want to stick around after what she's been through? She stuck around to be closer to her daughter. It's why she tries to be a better person and get a job with some meaning by teaching the kids at school. During this time, she visits her daughter and, on one of the visits, gave Eliza Charlotte's dolls, trying to make a bad situation have some kind of non-creepiness. \n When Ali married Rollins or sometime before then, she took him to Amish country to meet her daughter. That's why they were there on their honeymoon because poor Eliza's stepdad was Rollins. This also might explain why Rollins decided to drive Ali crazy instead of marrying her and killing her for her money. If you consider that Ali got her hands on 51% of The Carissimi Group, then if she married Rollins, then died first, that Ali not being a mother would have meant that Rollins would have inherited the money and controlling interest in the company. So, you have to ask: why didn't Rollins just save himself some time and wait a few months, then have Ali meet with a suspicious \"accident\" or something, if at least part of his motivations were to get at her money for Mary Drake? He didn't because that's not what would have happened if Ali is a mother. Since Ali had a daughter, the money maybe goes to Eliza, at which point Rollins would have really gotten little. When he discovered this, he decided a plan to have control over the money while Ali was alive made more sense for his purposes. The timeline of Eliza's age versus the amount of time that has passed since the summer before Ali disappeared also seems to work, as do hints at other, paralleling plots, like Emily's eggs being taken from her and Spencer having been pregnant with Toby's baby at one point, etc..": "PrettyLittleLiars",
            "Throughout Rick and Deanna's entire conversation about what to do with Pete, all I could think was that what Alexandria needs is a prison. Which is pretty ironic, considering, well, uh... Rick's group's history with finding a safe place. \n But, no, I mean a real prison. What Rick and Deanna are arguing about are the basic tenets of civilization. Rick argues that civilization is gone and it's kill-or-be-killed. Deanna argues that civilization only ever existed once and will only ever exist again if people make it and then fight to uphold it. They are both right and they are both very wrong. \n Rick is right that the state of the world is more perilous than Deanna realizes it to be. While she's not at all stupid and she is willing to take a lot risks, Deanna hasn't seen what Rick's group has seen, so she hasn't been called upon to make many of these kinds of choices. Unlike others, she appreciates that Rick has but Rick also can't see that he's been pushed over the edge and is in danger of losing what's left of his humanity, if Deanna and her concepts of civilization can't bring him back from the edge. They have to find a way to meet in the middle, to protect  everyone . \n This means they have to have laws for Rick's empty uniform to enforce. They have to work together to rebuild what exactly it means to have civilization and give civilization the power to actually protect people. The power to do that comes not from 'if you don't work out, we kill you' but from the laws put into place by society. The problem with Alexandria right now is that it hasn't transitioned from being a group of people clinging to the world before the world ended into a totally new form of society that has come about as a result  of  the world ending. Deanna's mentality isn't lacking in foresight, like Dawn's \"I'll just hold down the fort until the Army comes so that I don't have to be responsible for anything\" mentality at the hospital. Deanna wants to rebuild the world with Alexandria. It's just that until Rick's group showed up, the focus was on just staying alive and keeping going as opposed to saying 'okay, we've made the threat relatively manageable now, so what's next?' \n Alexandria is a lot like its outer walls-- they look like they'll hold up the community and keep them all safe and, so far, they've been fine. But one day they won't be enough. That day is already here. Rick warns that the big threat now isn't the zombies, it's other people. People are capable of climbing over Alexandria's walls-- so Abraham needs to rebuild them. People are capable of committing crimes inside the walls-- so Deanna needs laws as preventive measures before she can ask Rick and Michonne to enforce them. They need a system and consequences. They can't exile people because Rick is right, the threat will just keep coming back, but they also just can't go around murdering everyone because Deanna is also right, it's uncivilized and makes the people of Alexandria no different than the people with whom they are in conflict. They've got to have a prison.": "thewalkingdead",
            "Yes, I know they've all said there won't be a crossover between TWD and Fear. It's even possible that they're not just B.S.-ing that. If it were any other show, that'd be ridiculous but since we're talking two shows set almost across the country from one another in a world where going three feet can be deadly, it does make a lot of sense that there won't be stories and/or characters from Fear and TWD that cross over into one another. That means that Fear  technically  isn't a spinoff-- it's more of a companion story. Generally? Companion stories have more than just mechanics or setting in common. There is usually some kind of link between the characters and their stories. On both series, family is the ultimate theme-- it's what the main characters live and die for. So, it wouldn't be improbable then to think that some of the Fear characters are family of characters in TWD, separated from them in the world of the zombie apocalypse. \n The strongest theory, I think, is the idea that Madison is Rick's sister. Getting the obvious out of the way right away: there's virtually nothing to back this up. This is really more of a musing than a real theory here but oh well. Clues include the following: a) we know exactly nothing about Rick's family life prior to Lori and Carl, so they could do anything they wanted with it; b) Madison and Rick have very similar facial features to the point that they could pass for siblings; c) Madison speaks with a slight Southern accent at times, implying that she's not originally from Los Angeles; d) what little we know of Madison's backstory so far would allow for this to be possible because we haven't gone back far enough with her for there to be anything contradictory. \n If you view both shows from this perspective, you quickly begin to see that Madison and Rick have a lot in common and even react in similar ways to different situations. More interestingly? There are already things happening in Fear that parallel events in TWD or are blatant visual callbacks to TWD moments. If you look at both shows as one, big story about one family, then instead of just seeing the same stories repeating, you see family members paralleling one another. In the pilot of Fear, Nick has a reverse of Rick's experiences-- Nick sees a zombie for the first time, winds up in the hospital, whereas his uncle Rick woke up in a hospital in the pilot of TWD, left, and then saw a zombie for the first time. That sort of thing... Both shows also feature male-female siblings making their way through childhood (on TWD) and young adulthood (on Fear) together-- Carl & Judith, Nick & Alicia as parallels to Rick & Madison? I might even go so far as to suggest that the way that Rick treats Maggie suggests he's used to having a strong, sibling-like relationship with a woman and that maybe Maggie reminds him of his sister, Maddie. \n Finally, there's the fact that TWD periodically does flashbacks. We haven't seen this on Fear yet but Fear's only had a few episodes so far and probably will get there at some point. If the writers ever wanted to do something like this or have characters from one show on the other to spice up ratings or viewer interest or whatever in one or both shows, then the easiest way to do that isn't to bring the groups together in the present, it's to connect the characters in the past. A flashback of Maddie going back to Georgia to see her brother or something might add some nice layers to all the characters involved and hook together the stories of both shows into something a little more unified.": "FanTheories",
            "So, the best way to end a story is usually to circle back to its beginning in some way, right? At first glance, this would seem pretty impossible to do with Lady Mary's story next season. If you believe that Lady Mary accomplished all her early goals by marrying Matthew and giving birth to George, then it is likely that you view her plot since Matthew's death as being largely about personal fulfillment rather than fulfilling an obligation-- that she's been looking for a new man for her own happiness and to be a good father to her son, rather than trying to marry and produce heirs to Downton to keep up her family responsibility. This is true to some extent but not really to all of it. \n George is only a toddler and the show is going to end in Christmas 1925. That means that it is going to be well into the late 1940s before George is capable of running Downton on his own-- and that's if he survives the Second World War, in which he will inevitably fight. Downton has already seen its share of trouble in changing times-- a main plot throughout all of the seasons. It will be up to Lady Mary to keep Downton running long enough for her son to have something to inherit. Matthew's will empowered Mary to have a say in the running of the estate that she wouldn't have otherwise but I think the show is going to go one step further. I think it's going to circle back to the entail plot from the first series, as it's my understanding that England abolished entail laws in 1925. I think Lord Grantham is going to decide that his health scare from last season means he has to make some decisions about power when it comes to the estate for the next couple of decades, in the event that he should die sooner rather than later. Either the law makes this decision for him or (hopefully) he becomes active in changing it but the end result is that Lady Mary will inherit Downton in her own right by the end of the series. \n The irony of this is that it then makes most of Lady Mary's plot in the first few series somewhat irrelevant-- all that drama and strife over having to make an heir happen and she winds up with it herself-- but that's part of her story and part of the point of her story. Now that she inherits Downton outright and it will pass along to George, Lady Mary is truly free-- she can marry anybody she damn pleases, for any reason she desires, and she doesn't have to worry that her new husband will attempt to undercut her ability to control Downton because it is outrightly hers under the law. \n As a result, I don't think Lady Mary actually marries any of these guys. She's for sure not marrying Lord Gillingham, whom she rightly threw over last season (and who is actually a fairly solid bet for the one who killed Mr. Green, which might be why he's still sticking around in the story). She's not marrying that snooze Evelyn Napier. She's not marrying Tom, who is likely going to move back from Boston to help Mary run Downton after something happens like Lord Grantham is really sick this time (prompting this whole plot, possibly.) And she's not going to marry Henry Talbot, as dishy as he is, because please. Lady Mary's not going to marry a race car driver after what happened to Matthew but she for sure will relish the challenge a bit. That leaves Charles Blake as a potential surprise return and he's the only one with real staying power-- the guy she is one day really going to regret passing over. \n Ultimately, though, the fact that there are a handful of guys with a semi-equal shot at wedding Lady Mary is something of an indicator that the plot isn't going to ultimately be about who she marries-- it's going to be about the freedom and control she's wished for since the first season finally really coming to pass for her. She doesn't really need a father-figure for George if Tom stays at Downton (which he probably will, ultimately) and she won't really need a husband for any social reason. As a result, Lady Mary marries her true love, Downton, and continues on her journey to wind up a sharp-tongued, badass, old dame like her grandmother with more than a few saucy tales under her belt.": "DowntonAbbey"

            "1) Buffy very clearly ended her \"relationship\" with Spike episodes before this \n 2) Their relationship NEVER included Spike coming uninvited into her home, her space to have sex. They always had sex outside of her place. \n 3) Spike knows that she is injured before he acts (Note: I am not positive on this point, but from what I remember he comments on it. I am not willing to rewatch the scene to confirm or deny, so if anyone knows otherwise let me know). \n 4) The answer to Buffy's question, \"Ask me again why I could never love you,\" is partially  because  Spike does NOT have a soul. His behavior in this scene is one example of how not having a soul affects the way he acts. \n 5) This IS an attempted rape. I know the author claims he/she is not victim blaming, but it sure as hell feels like it to me. They are framing Buffy as causing this to happen because she led Spike on.

            "Warning: this is a lengthy post, but I'm looking for what others think. Please add to or critique what I've said. \n Now that we've seen Clara in a good number of episodes, I'm starting to become concerned of the similarities in the way that her character is fleshed out to the way that Amy's character was fleshed out. Note, I am not drawing a comparison to their personalities. Instead I am drawing a comparison between their back stories. \n Much like Moffat did with Amy, it seems that so far Clara's episodes almost obsessively focus on the companion. I personally find this very irritating - I like it better when the companions serve as an audience proxy / very HUMAN companion instead of the center of some huge mystery (although as I type that out I realize that Rose with Bad Wolf and Donna with Doctor-Donna are both the centers of big events, however the mystery behind these was not harped on so much throughout their episodes. It was more subtle? in a way. Definitely off track from my main point though). Despite this focus on the companion, who we are supposed to care immensely for, we know so little about both Amy's (and so far Clara's) \"Real life\"! We don't know much about their friends, families, etc., which is partially what I think makes RTD's companions so relatable. \n I guess I made this post because I grew to very much dislike Amy (for a variety of reasons), and do not want to dislike Clara. I so much hope that Clara is given more \"Real life\" connections. \n Here is a previous comment I made on the subject that hopefully sums up what I'm trying to argue, although it might be repetitive: \n \"One of the problems I have had so far with Moffat's era is that much of the show revolves around Amy, and yet... we know next to nothing about her life outside the Doctor. She was also paired with the same Doctor for a longer stretch of time than any one regeneration/companion pairing in NuWho. \n Rose: We got to know her relationship with her mother, her father, and her sometimes boyfriend. Jackie, Pete, and Mickey all had their own personalities and at points were a tangential part of a major plot. \n Martha: We got to know her mother, father, brother, and sister. I would say they had lesser roles than Rose's family, but each seemed to have a distinct personality and at times were a tangential part of a major plot. \n Donna: We got to know her mother and grandfather. Wilfred in particular played a major role across several episodes, most notably that he is the reason 10 regenerates! While her mum was not as important to the plot, it did show a possible influence on why Donna acts or feels the way she does. \n Amy: We got to know her husband Rory, obviously, but he was a companion as well and did not significantly add to her life outside of the doctor. After that... ? We know she lived with her aunt growing up (who I don't think we ever meet), and that when the TARDIS explodes her parents come back (who, again, I don't recall ever meeting... maybe for a moment at the wedding?). To me this has the effect of making Amy seem like less of a real person. \n Rory: We got to know his wife Amy, obviously, and his father. I've always liked Rory more than Amy (my personal opinion), but I definitely think that having episodes with his father made him seem more real and multi-dimensional. It also made me care more about his fate. When Rory and Amy are sent back in time by the angels, I thought about how much his father would miss him. I imagined how his father would find out, how he would react, etc. I did not have the same thoughts for Amy's family... by being sent back in time she really didn't seem to lose anything important. \n I hope that we learn more of Clara's family, friends, background, etc. than we did with Amy. I am also not personally excited about the mystery surrounding her deaths/lives, but just looking forward to a new Doctor/companion relationship!\"": "gallifrey",

UChicago is kind of a \"quirky\" school, and they really want you to show that you're different from all of the other smart people applying (although if you don't have the gpa/test scores, don't bother applying). \n Overall, make sure that an interesting/unique personality shines through your application.  It is a really great school, and most students have a positive experience there. Just prepare yourself to work hard  (I mean, when most kids in the city mention something about it you'll inevitably hear that it is \"where fun goes to die\" because of all of the work. But don't let that discourage you haha). \n If you don't get in, don't stress about it. There are plenty of amazing schools in the US, and sometimes when people focus too much on their dream school they can forget that. Also consider applying to Northwestern if you just want to be in the Chicago area (and, again, have the academic record to get in), although both schools have very different vibes.

            "This post contains spoilers for Angel the series) \n I absolutely cannot stand the Angel episode \"I Will Remember You.\" Brief synopsis for non-ATS viewers: Buffy shows up in LA to confront Angel after he secretly helped her fight the Chumash spirits in the Thanksgiving episode. While she is there, a demon's blood causes Angel to be turned into a human. After a series of events (Bangel sex, weak human Angel getting his ass kicked, etc.) Angel decides to ask the powers that be to turn back time so he can remain a vampire. After turning back into a vampire, Angel is the only one that remembers what happened. \n I initially loved this episode because of the novelty of Buffy crossing over shows and the emotional impact. It's a good look at what could be/could have been. \n HOWEVER, I cannot stand Angel's choice in this episode. I completely disagree with the idea that he chose to turn back into a vampire for selfless or noble reasons. He did not want to be a weak human. He saw how comparatively helpless it made him, and got scared. He did not want to give up his supernatural powers (specifically physical strength). \n Was part of that motivated by a desire to protect Buffy? Undoubtedly. But if Angel was truly a \"champion,\" he would remain a human. Becoming human was not the easy path, it was the harder one. Fans like to focus on what he gives up by choosing not to be a human when he has the chance (specifically true love with Buffy), but ultimately  everything else  in his life would have been more difficult. \n How would he be able to fight as a human? Would his martial arts training and years of experience be enough? Or would be become more like Xander - contributing to the cause but ultimately unable to hold his own in a physical battle. Could he reintegrate himself into the real world? Would Buffy still be able to love him now that they are no longer physically equal? \n And one of the worst parts of his decision - he doesn't even bother to consult Buffy. The love of his life. The person that he is supposedly making this choice for. He sneaks out without telling her multiple times (first to find and fight the demon, second to see the PTB). He behaves cowardly towards the one person that loves him more than anything (although their relationship has always been wrought with miscommunication and subterfuge, but I digress).": "buffy",
            "I definitely agree with your points that people enjoy characters with more drama/excitement, neither of which Riley has. \n That said, I personally think people understand that he was supposed to be \"that guy\", but that doesn't make it any more enjoyable to watch. People make the same argument about Dawn, that her whiny behavior is a natural result of the adversity she face - yes, that's true, but I  don't care to see it . I don't care if the writers designed characters to have boring/shitty traits; that's not enough for me to appreciate the characters. \n It's possible to make characters have flaws or be more boring while still  interesting to watch . This is predicated on a combination of good writing, character development, and capable actors. While BTVS tends to have good writing (aside from some major dud episodes), and Riley certainly undergoes character development (although his descent to vampire-feeding seemed to happen to quickly), the actor just wasn't very good. He seemed stiff and wooden, not just in a \"soldierly\" way but in a bad-acty way. He seemed to have pretty much 1-2 facial expressions: serious and happy. \n Riley's character also seemed to have pretty much zero non-scooby connections post-initiative (which actually coincides with one of my main critiques of Tara: where were her friends and outside life?). Wasn't he a TA? Shouldn't he have continued in school? Angel had an outside life (history with Spike/Drusilla, fighting demons on his own, keeping secrets from Buffy) and even Spike did too (relationships with Dru/Harmony, friendship with Clem, keeping secrets from Buffy). Riley pretty much became a paper cut out once the initiative shut down (although with eventual bonus keeping secrets from Buffy). He was so far beyond boring at that point. \n I don't care that Riley was a part of a normal relationship. Tara was Willow's generally boring/normal lover, and aside from a few critiques I have of her I don't think she was a complete waste of a character. In fact many people seem to like Tara that dislike Riley. \n Went off on a tangent, so I guess here's my too long, didn't read:": "buffy",
            "Many teachers do think that a longer school day could be beneficial to students, IF implemented properly. If time was added to the day without the right amount of planning (i.e. What would happen during this time period? Additional classes, longer lunch or recess, gym more than one day a week? If lunch was made longer, would additional lunch monitors be needed? If additional classes were added, what money would be used to buy additional materials? etc.) then it might not really have a significant benefit towards the child's education. Some teachers don't think it's a good idea to rush into this without thinking out all the way through. \n Some teachers are also concerned that they will be working longer without seeing a comparable pay increase, which I believe any employee would think about. \n As for your comment about ALL public schools going from 8-1:45, I know that to be false. I personally know of schools that go from 7-1:40, 8-2:35, and 8-2:30, so the time can vary from school to school. \n Thank you for bringing attention to this issue because I think it is important for the discussion to continue.": "chicago"

            "NOTE : I'm only looking at what I know of the TV Show. As I understand, non-television sources like  Lungbarrow  and the Big Finish audio works explore Gallifrey quite thoroughly and might give a more definitive answer. \n \n To set basic boundaries, the  Time Lords  definitely  don't predate the universe , as the Doctor scoffs at the notion of things existing before the universe  (The Satan Pit).  Additionally, we know that the Time Lords  emerged sometime   after  the Weeping Angels and Carrionites, as they consider the Weeping Angels as \"of old\" and the Carrionites as uncertain \"legend\"  (The End of Time Part Two, The Shakespeare Code) . For reference, Weeping Angels are \"very nearly\" as old as the universe and the Carrionites were from \" the dawn of the universe \"  (Blink, The Shakespeare Code) . \n However, you are right in assuming that Gallifrey is ancient, as Rassilon and Omega and the foundation of the  Time Lords  vastly  predates  the Doctor's time  (The Three Doctors, The Five Doctors , etc. ) . For reference, the furthest back he's ever gone is  4.6 Billion BCE   (The Runaway Bride) . \n Tellingly, a Time Lord agent informed the Doctor that the \" Time Lords transcended  such simple  mechanical devices when the universe was less than half its present size \"  (Genesis of the Daleks) . Someone could do the math on that one (I couldn't find a specific number), but this is clearly billions of years in the past (and the Time Lords are already extremely advanced by this time). \n So I'm not really able to nail down specific dates, but...  the Time Lords are old as balls.": "gallifrey",
            "Guys, please stop. Please. \n Derpy is in  no danger . Seriously, when we feed back on ourselves in this little echochamber, things amplify way further than normal. Let's just step out a bit and take in the big picture here. \n For us, who have created the character and developed all this backstory the opening line is \"Careful, Derpy\". But for the average layman that line is \"Careful,  derpy \". The context makes no distinction and without that crucial piece of knowledge, the whole scene changes. Now it appears as if Rainbow Dash has directly called her retarded and her later impatient quips of sarcasm and outright yelling at the character take on a very unfortunate tone. Without knowledge that this is her name, it becomes very offensive. \n Further the words \"derp\" and \"derpy\" have loose legal ownership under its creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker, who not only created the word in 1998 in their film Basketball, but also have a character named Mr. Derp on their show South Park, opening the potential for Viacom to take legal action if Hasbro tried to name a character using that unique word. \n This puts them in a difficult position. If they keep the word, it will have to make it clear that it is not her name, which would make the scene  more  insulting. The only real solution here would be to remove the word entirely. \n The other changes are minor. They [didn't even remove the crossed eyes]( and the only reason they rerecorded her lines was due to original actress Tabitha St. Germain [accidentally mistook Derpy for being a boy]( and so they re-recorded them in their proper feminine. \n They could have erased the character entirely, made her into some other clutzy pony. Gave her a pallette swap, slap on a different cutie mark, straighten the eyes and call her Normalia, but they  didn't . \n Derpy's still there. Crossed eyes and all. They just re-recorded a few accidental lines and removed  one word . \n Let's not act like this is somehow throwing poor Derpy out on the streets. She's fine, she's still in the show, and there's no reason to think otherwise. Heck, one Hasbro animator has flat out stated that [there's no intent in changing the character.]( \n Let's all just calm down and chill on this one.

            "I wouldn't select a companion without carefully studying Matt Smith. \n Character chemistry simply cannot exist without actor chemistry and Matt's not really had the opportunity to have a companion selected  specifically  with chemistry between them in mind. This is what made Eccleston and Piper work. This is what made Tennant and Tate work. Chemistry is  vital . \n That said, interactions between the characters have to work. You have to come up with a dynamic that allows the character to have something to work off of, preferably a foil. Something that contrasts well with them while simultaneously complimenting them. Something that challenges  both  characters by creating a unique reaction between the two of them. \n Sherlock (or House) have a vitriolic and frequently bitter persona with staggering intellect that's nicely complimented by the down-to-earth and sensible Watson (or Wilson). You need a dynamic that not only works plot-wise (someone to have things explained to) but something that works out when mixing their personalities (someone to reel in the other, to be their \"other half\"). \n With all this in mind I think that the perfect companion  for the Eleventh Doctor  is a child. Moreover, a child who acts with a maturity far beyond their years. \n Matt Smith has shown an incredibly proficiency with working with children, both on-set and off. He's good with kids, he gets them. From Amelia to Young Kazran to his work with kids in Who Confidential and the Proms Matt Smith does  amazing  with children, and most children seem to do incredibly well working against him. \n There's a unique dynamic possibility. The Eleventh Doctor is an old man with the spirit and mind of a young man. He's reckless, he's a bit foolish, he's sporadic and messy and unruly. His natural foil would be a child with the mind of an adult. \n He's a terribly hurt soul. He's got old eyes that have seen terrible things. He's tainted, he's tarnished, he's got a blackened soul but he's so full of joy and exuberance and life. The foil to that would be someone innocent and untouched but reserved, not lively. \n We've seen this dynamic work in the form of Amelia. The \"have you got an apple\" exchange and the following montage of food is one of the Eleventh Doctor's best scenes. His \"you know when adults tell you everything's going to be alright\" line is one of his most famous lines. The dynamic is there and it  works . \n The child would need to be a phenomenal actor. I mean a knock-out. Like a McCaulkin or a Fanning. Someone of  that  caliber. It would definitely be a tricky cast, but the potential is  incredible . \n I'll try to keep this brief but the benefits couldn't be greater. You get an amazing new dynamic, you get an audience surrogate for kids (and hence engage a demographic better)  and  a role-model that parents will approve of. Moreover this has the potential to  rock  Doctor Who out of atrophy. It's a radically new dynamic, something that hasn't truly gotten attention since the First Doctor.": "gallifrey",
            "Abrams and TOS \n The biggest qualms voiced by detractors of Abram's Trek (outside of the nigh memetic \"lenseflares!\") are against it's disregard for hard science, it's \"just have a fun adventure\" plot, it's heavy use of action and explosions, and it's increased sexuality. \n This is shocking in many parts because \"action-filled, sexy, space-adventure\" quite aptly describes a massive if not core element of The Original Series, the very show that it's attempting to adapt. \n If one were to watch solely TOS then enter into the Abrams film cold one would likely view it as a very successful adaptation of an older show, reinventing where it needed to and staying true to the source when it felt right. \n But that's not the general reaction because of so much that has happened between Roddenberry's vision and today, and I think that has an enormous amount to do with the current hostility to different re-imaginings. \n TNG and the 24th Century Trek \n Now before I go any further I'd like to make something clear: The Next Generation and Deep Space Nine (and yes, at rare times, Voyager) were not just works that revolutionized science fiction, they revolutionized  all of television . They created character that will be remembered as legends, crafted stories that will resound with people across time. These shows aren't just landmark, they're phenomenal  tour de forces  of talent in all categories. \n However three massive shows on the air, often airing two at a time, leaves quite the effect on a fandom. An idea of \"what is Star Trek\" is quickly made in this image during the show's commercial and critical peak. \n This more philosophical, more nuanced Trek that benefited from the longer and more forgiving format of serialized television became the norm. \n And while this vision is superb, it's also a bit limiting. \n To illustrate I'll bring in that  other  phenomenal science fiction series: Doctor Who. \n What Doctor Who Does that Trek Doesn't \n Over the years Doctor Who proved itself to be very malleable. Much like Star Trek you could have an episode where you'd go from the distant past to faraway planets and stars. \n Unlike Star Trek, however, Doctor Who embraced far more genres, themes, and styles. It was willing to fully embrace horror, comedy, tragedy, drama, romance, action, mystery, thriller, heist, spy-adventure. The list went on and on and on. \n Where Star Trek embraced rigidity and formed a strict canon Doctor Who flew in the face of all this and embraced change. The entire cast, the setting, the style, the tone, all of this could (and would) change at the drop of a hat and for that the show went on for fifty years. \n Why Trek Looks Back Instead of Forward \n Star Trek was very, very focused on that \"golden age\" of the 24th Century where it produced some of the greatest television in history. \n Everything that kept the spirit of the human adventure, of triumph over adversity and growing in the face of the unknown, in a way that differed from this was treated with skepticism and even derision. \n The opening to Enterprise, for example, was both incredibly bold (in terms of song choice for a sci-fi it's about as daring as the opening to Firefly) and totally within the spirit of the show. But even to this day it's mocked and even loathed by the Trek community. Why? In large part because it's so different than the norm. \n The Side Effects: The Community \n Shockingly, in a community that centers around a message of discovery and tolerance, intolerance and shutting out of the new abounds. \n I've heard people not just insult the new film, but go so far to insult Abrams himself and deride it as being part of a \"Apple Store twenty-something me-first generation\". It's an inherent loathing of the new and all that it represents. \n Boycotts, hateful rhetoric. It's to the point where outright lies claiming that Abrams somehow wishes to make his Trek \"the definitive Trek\" and have everyone forget it's origins are being fabricated to vindicate hatred. It's positively absurd, and this is most certainly caused by an unmoving devotion to the past above all else. \n Why We Need to Look to Batman \n In all times of struggle great men will turn to Batman for the answers, and here is no exception. \n Batman has been around for over seventy years. During that time he's been reimagined as a golden-age classic crimefighter, a silver age science-fiction hero, a camp pastiche, a gothic crusader, a brutally merciless avenger, and a  gritty and realistic dark knight. \n We've seen Miller and Dini and Burton and Nolan all take the reigns, all forging vastly different versions of this same story, all retelling the same legend in a new way. All different, but all Batman. \n This doesn't make Batman weaker, if anything it makes his mythos  stronger . Where Star Trek languished in a massive desert with nothing running Batman has only continued to thrive as it branches out more and more. \n While The Brave and the Bold aired on Saturday morning screens, The Dark Knight hit the silver one. No two interpretations could be more disparate, and yet both succeeded and both were Batman. \n The Future \n I think the same can be said for Star Trek. We see new as the enemy and this leads us into stagnation. When TNG first came out  it  was the new kid on the block and  it  had to make bold moves and forge it's own path. We need to be willing to allow the same for any new interpretation of Trek as well.": "DaystromInstitute",
            "The dissertation I read wasn't just analysis, I also did exactly what you're proposing: how to make it better. \n Oswin's trapped and one of her first lines are wondering if the Daleks are vampires. We're introduced to a pretty confused person who's unsure of what evil's out  there, but is smart enough to chronicle their movements (hence: \"they came again last night\"). \n She's portrayed as having \"gotten trapped on her first time in the stars\", so roll with that. If you want to make her smart make her capable with computers (maybe have her as a technician on the Alaska instead of a \"junior entertainment manager\"). \n She also is impatient and acts like she's in complete control of the Doctor and Co. That's not the best tact to take with someone desperately trying to be rescued. Make their relationship more like light, perhaps nervous bantering as she  helps  them as a  partner . \n Make her give slightly better explanations to how she was able to work the Daleks so easily. Have her just say \"this tech's surprisingly easy to work with, hold on\" instead of \"I did mention I was a  genius , right?\" \n Overall just a more consistent character. You can't have her be unflappable  and  having never explored beyond her backdoor. You can't have her be condescending  and  begging for help after being alone  for a solid year. \n All-in-all make this a character that the audience feels the need to root for. If you want her tragic end to  really  hold some weight, make the audience think that she  really  has been waiting for the Doctor's help and that this is all that she's ever wanted. \n Make her someone we can sympathize with, not look up to as some super-genius.

            "If you\u2019ve ever been around an old person, then odds are you\u2019ve heard the saying \u201cYour life goes by in the blink of an eye!\u201d And since old people are closer to death than everyone else who isn\u2019t currently on fire, it stands to reason they have a unique perspective on the whole mortality thing. The Weeping Angels themselves represent death and old age, and the fact that they only move when you aren\u2019t looking is a metaphor for how life will pass you by if you fail to appreciate or savor it. \n Case in point: Larry Nightingale, the blogger fanatic obsessed with the mysterious DVD extra who we the audience know as the Doctor. It is implied that Larry spends his time sitting around, watching bad movies, and blogging about conspiracy theories. Larry is so obsessed with unknowable mysteries and trivialities that he is missing out on real life, letting it flutter by while he posts on message boards about DVD features. \n Detective Billy Shipton represents the antithesis to Larry. Billy lives his life in the moment, never regretting the things he did not do. When Sally asks him why he cut work to ask her on a date, he simply responds \u201cbecause  life is short  and you are hot.\u201d Billy understands that life is a precious gift that is not to be wasted, while Larry is so caught up with trivialities that he is literally missing his life. \n When Sally visits an elderly Billy in the hospital late into the episode, Billy proffers his hands. \u201cLook at my hands, Sally. They are old man\u2019s hands. How did that happen?\u201d It\u2019s a question that everyone who lives to a ripe old age ends up asking themselves: where did all that time go? The irony of \u201cBlink\u201d is that the Angels are all too real. Aging, regret, and a sense of missed opportunity follow us all throughout our lives. Moffat has simply personified these abstract concepts into a creature we happen to associate with death and the afterlife. The fact that the Angels are made of stone represents the immovable, objective nature of death and its surety; it also adds to the creepy factor by calling up images of graveyards and tombstones. \n After his terrifying encounter with the Weeping Angels, Larry appears to be a changed man. Having literally stared death in the face, he now appreciates life and wants to spend it meaningfully by pursuing a relationship with Sally.  But Sally herself has become preoccupied with the pursuit of the unknown, obsessing over the mystery of how everything fits together. Only her chance encounter with the Doctor is able to put her mind at ease and allow her to move on with her life, finally at peace and free of the Angels. \n As the final montage of the statues scattered across the world makes clear, the Angels are all around us, both literally and metaphorically. They are simply waiting for us to \u201cblink\u201d, waiting for us to underappreciate the value of our own lives, waiting for us to let our guard down and let our lives pass us by so they can swoop in and snatch us into oblivion.": "gallifrey",
            "I just happened to have re-watched \"The Unquiet Dead\" and I noticed something rather startling. \n In the end, without any real fanfare or focus or melodrama Nine mentions that Charles Dickens will never be able to \"tell the truth\" and return to his former artistic vigor as he'll die early next year. \n Rose doesn't balk or really show any sense of empathy to this news at all. Really Nine just treats it as a convenient factoid and swans off on his next adventure. It's literally an afterthought to the episode. \n Now this stands in  stark  contrast with later episodes about going to the past and knowing of famous deaths. \n In Fires of Pompeii a major element is the companion wanting to save those destined to die. It's not  the  focal point, but it is incredibly major and the conflict between a companion who wants to change the past and the Doctor who must sternly enforce the natural order of things (which actually parallels quite a bit with \"Father's Day\", but I'm getting ahead of myself). \n The episode that  most  revolves around a character's inevitable demise is that of Vincent in \"Vincent and the Doctor\". While \"The Unquiet Dead manages to \"add to (Dicken's) pile of good things\"  without making a big deal about it. Much like the Doctor later notes with Agatha Christie's work in \"Unicorn and the Wasp\", he tells Dickens that his work will last \"forever\" and just leaves it at that. \n He clearly improved what was left of Dicken's life and improved the depression he was in and introduced him to a bigger world of phantasmagoria.": "doctorwho"

            "so, just finished watching the new episode. Amazing. Absolutely amazing. I can safely say now that Clara is the one companion I absolutely love and is definitely my favorite now. The plot was interesting, love how contemporary we are getting with some of these stories and all the references now. And all the wonderful little mysteries that Moffatt has left for us (124, \"the woman in the shop,\" 'Summer Falls,' ages 16 and 23, etc.) are some things to wonder. \n but let us go back a while, and remember the flickering lights that were so subtley dominant in the first half of the season. In every episode, an instance of a flickering light was featured somewhere in the episode, most notably that the Doctor even acknowledged it in \"A Town Called Mercy,\" but quickly dismisses for more important and relevant matters. \n for reference of each episode, in \"Asylum of the Daleks\" the lights in Amy's make-up station flickered shortly before she was abducted by the Daleks. \"Dinosaurs on a Spaceship,\" Brian Williams was trying to fix a lightbulb in Amy and Rory's place in the beginning of the episode. \"A Town Called Mercy,\" all of the lampposts flicker in town, but like I said most notably, while the Doctor is contemplating how to deal with the Gunslinger and Kahler-Jex, a hanging lightbulb in the Sheriff's Office flickered and he noticed that and stared at it for a second before forgetting it. in \"The Power of Three,\" the lights in the basement of the Tower of London went out, even situational it is an instance of this. \"The Angels Take Manhatten,\" obvious. \n And so, we all thought it might have had something to do with the Weeping Angels and, at least I thought at first, Moffatt simply didn't answer the fact that we had flickering lights throughout the whole season for the sake of focusing on Amy and Rory's departure and his whole \"movie in an episode\" format for the season. I had dealt with that disappointment cause I favor an overarching story arc in the background, like Bad Wolf or the Cracks. \n but no, in \"The Snowmen,\" it returned at the moment when Clara kissed the Doctor and you see the lights quickly flicker. and now, in \"The Bells of Saint John,\" there are a few instances of the lights, but all of these seem to be part of the plot and not subtle anymore. Such as Miss Kizlet having the lights going out in London and all the lights in Clara's neighborhood turning on to scare the couple. Then again, I guess somehow to show the use of the WiFi, the lights in the coffee place flickered whenever Miss Kizlet hacks one of the people to speak to the Doctor. \n Does this mean that the Great Intelligence has been somehow watching the Doctor throughout this whole season? Or is there something even bigger at hand? Or maybe I'm just reading too much into this now, hoping for something out of it. Please let me know what you think, cause the flickering lights was a big point of discussion among my friends, and we always enjoy picking apart Moffatt's brain.": "doctorwho",
            "now, first off, Moffat said there'd be no overall story arc and he'd want the writers to write each episode as it's own stand-alone movie. but that doesn't mean there can't be any connecting hints towards the coming midseries finale. \n my first theory to talk about is one i saw a while ago, when Dinosaurs on a Spaceship came out. some one made a thread explaining his theory(which i can't find again) so i'll just summarize it for you. basically, it's said that Episode 5, The Angels Take Manhatten, takes place before episodes 2-4 for the Doctor(as for Asylum of the Daleks, it's hard to tell, will explain why later) now, as Whovians we all know the Ponds are departing with that episode, and it will most likely be heartwrenching. whatever happens in that episode, it must've been devastating to the Doctor, so devastating, he couldn't stand not seeing the Ponds again and feels guilty for whatever happened. eps 2-4 are just adventures he takes the Ponds on again to see them after they've departed, out of guilt and loneliness. why Asylum of the Daleks is hard to tell with if it fits with this timeline is because the Ponds were just taken by the Daleks, instead of the Doctor taking them on a trip. \n this theory can also be evidenced by the Doctor's personality in all recent episodes. everyone can obviously tell that he's become more heartless, more ruthless, and more malicious than he ever has been before. if this theory is right, then whatever happens in TATM must have broken him, similar to the Last Great Time War. but just traveling with the Ponds helps him find his way again. and you can also tell in his conversations with the Ponds, that they are always ominous and he seems to know something about their death whenever they bring it up and why he cares so much about their marriage, that should die(or leave) happy and together. \n done with that now(i think) let's move onto the Lightbulb theory. at first, i didn't think much of it when AotD first aired. i noticed that they prominently showed the lights flickering in Amy's dressing room, but i just brushed it off as something related to her abduction by the Daleks. but as we've all seen, they prominently show it in every episode now, and especially when they start their adventures. i've seen a lot of people think about the Silence and the Weeping Angels, and while they both make sense, it's hard to make actual sense of it until they reveal the meaning of it. far as i can tell, the flickering lights signal the start of their next adventure, and the Doctor has obviously taken note of it in ATCM. he knows there's something to it, but either can't figure it out yet and doesn't want to alarm the Ponds, or he already knows what they means and dreads it for the Ponds. \n as for Oswin, that's a whole nother dinosaur i don't want to tackle, i just want to see how they handle her ;)": "doctorwho",
            "now, i've thought it about this for a bit. remember when Oda said that he originally planned for the series to last for only 5 years in manga form? but then said he was having so much fun with it, he decided to make it last longer. \n now, i don't know when EXACTLY he decided to switch from 5 years to the length it is now, but if we look at what we have with the series, you would see that if the series had ended in the 5 year span he planned originally, it would be at the end of the Arabasta Saga. Now, why with a series that had the outset of the protaganist becoming the greatest figure in the world, the Pirate King, simply end so early in the middle of the Grand Line? \n And even if Oda had decided to lengthen his series and then in turn expand the rest of the arcs, no way he could hope to get through the New World and find One Piece in any kind of timespan of 5 years. \n To anybody who doesn't know, Oda also said along with extending the series than the originally planned 5 years, that he is also going to have the same ending he had already planned, that he already knows how he's going to end the whole series. So the question is, how could Luffy find One Piece and become the Pirate King if he doesn't end up in Raftel, where it supposedly is? One possible theory is that One Piece was originally in Arabasta, but that's very highly unlikely. \n No, my theory is that the ending of the series will be the discovery of the Rio Poneglyph and the telling of the True History of the Void Century. If you think about it, that's what the Arabasta Saga was all about, Crocodile trying to find that Poneglyph(although, to find Pluton, not the True History) and Robin says her journey will end at Raftel, where she will most likely find it after discovering the rest of the Poneglyphs. \n Now, the exact details of the Rio Poneglyph may not be the same as they would have been with the 5 year timespan, but I am sure the essence of it will be the same. I mean, the Void Century was essentially non-existent until Robin joined the group and started explaining her research on it. I bet the whole content and idea of the Void Century was created AFTER Oda decided to extend the series, but still planned to use the contents of the Poneglyph as the ending of the series, then leave Luffy's journey to become the Pirate King open to people's imagination. \n Now, I realize there are some gaps in this theory, but I generally tried to cover them all.": "OnePiece",
            "so i just beat the game today(would've been sooner if my sister wasn't also playing at the same time) and i must say, the whole last sequence was exciting. after completing the Sky Keep, i was wondering where this was going exactly. \n when i got to the Horde Battle, i was so excited that i would actually face waves of enemies on my way down to Ghirahim. i only wish that the mobs were stronger that they weren't OHKO most of the time, but it wasn't that big of a deal to me. \n Then the final Ghirahim battle was good fun, made it exciting to cause all those fatal blows to him from 100 meters in the air. Then they finally had the Dead Man's Volley that i was missing throughout the game, and he went down pretty fast cause of that. When he brought out his berserker sword, i had a little trouble cuz he kept switching stances, but i finally took it slow and took him down. \n then came the final battle with Demise. i do like his character and Ghirahim's, and the way they interacted for their few moments cause it showed how differently Ghirahim and Demise were as sword and master to Fi and Link. and i love Demise's pompous attitude towards Link and it makes sense cause this is the first 'legend' to happen so far in the storyline, i guess. Demise doesn't have any other previous encounters like Ganondorf does, and he knows it. he made numerous notes about how so many humans were insects in front of him. \n and the final battle, i had the most fun with. the first part went fast when i just kept attacking him and shielding his attacks in quick succession. it made me really use my shield(which i already did a lot in the game) for the second part since there was the problem of his ELECTRIC EVIL MASTER SWORD. but i learned the pattern, and was able to take him down within the minute then. \n this was the kind of final epic sword battle that Skyward Sword needed and deserved, one that didn't just make you swing wildly til they went down. and all the events that happened in between, and those awesome Groose moments(renaming the franchise 'The Legend of Groose?' genius) and of course, the revelation that would become Ganon's birth. then the final moment where Link actually makes a choice in what he does was heartwarming(watched a lot of Lost, i see a lot of conflicts of Destiny vs Free Will everywhere)": "zelda",

            "So, I bought the whole set of Commander 2014 decks at release, and have not touched them since in terms of changing them or taking them apart. I wanted to play with the vanilla decks with friends to see how well made they really were. Oh my lord, it was so much fun. It took us awhile to get the 5 of us and actually sit down to play it, but it was worth it. \n We played Star format combined with EDH, and damn was it a lot of fun. For those who don't know, Star is a format that requires 5 players, and each with a mono-colored deck(I'm sure you could do this with Wedges or Shards, Guilds probably not so much). Each player picks a color to play as, and everyone must be a different color. Then, they all sit in the typical MtG color spread, WUBRG like so on the back of a Magic card. In order to win, a player must defeat his 2 enemies in any way that the Commander format allows. So if you're playing White, your enemies are Black and Red, and you will win once both of them are defeated. This means it is possible for there to be 2 winners in the game. \n So for our game, I played the Green Commander deck, with Freyalise leading the charge. We all agreed to only use the planeswalker commanders, just because it felt right. And I started off strong. Turn 1 mana dork, turn 2 1-drop elf and Skullclamp and draw 2 extra cards from Skullclamp. From then on, my play was set. I started dropping Elves every turn and Freyalise as soon as possible to keep ahead of the curve. \n It got really silly when I had Priest of Titania out to tap for G for every Elf on the battlefield. I used that to cast Sylvan Offering, with X for 13, and split between my allies(White and Red) the Treefolk and Elves tokens. There was so much mana for me to tap for, along with Wellwisher to just gain so much life. \n My Blue enemy used Rite of Replication to copy my Priest so could have all the colorless mana to use, but after that never became much of a threat. Even with Teferi, there wasn't much happening on his side despite how many cards he drew unfortunately. My White ally used the 13 elves to his advantage to buff his Geist-Honored Monk and start beating on Black with all of his equipments. \n Meanwhile, Red just didn't do much as he wasn't drawing the mana he needed. And even when he did get out Caged Sun, it would immediately get bounced. I'm pretty sure he casted it like, 3 times in our game. It was really unfortunate that he amounted to nothing really in the end, cause I know that deck can do crazy things on its own. \n Black was holding its own with lifegain and Ob Nixilis, and kept repeatedly trying to slow me down with sacrificing and killing my creatures. But there was just too many Elves and my Wellwisher was beating out his lifegain. I eventually killed of Blue with a Creeperhulk buffed up from an Immaculate Magistrate and my army of Elves. It also had an Assault Suit on it, so I gave it to White on his next turn. \n I reminded him that if killed Black right now, only I would win. So he had to work it out to kill both Red and Black at the same time for both of us to win. He did, even though he could just kill Red on his own, and I would kill Black with Overrun the next time. It was an amazingly fun game, and the Offerings are great Commander cards, especially in the Star format, where it's so easy to pick who gets the benefits. \n So in the end, White and Green(me) won out at the same time, in the most glorious fashion. I honestly had hoped to use Titania's aspect of the deck, with all the land-based play and tokens, but Elves were just too strong to pass up in my opening hand.": "magicTCG",

            "Top Prospects: Basically the whole team. Javier Baez is the top prospect that is still in the minors (he will be at spring training with a good chance of joining the big league club sometime this season). There are only a handful of veterans slotted in our line up, most notably Luis Valbuena at third base. These guys are basically just hold overs until all of our young players are fully developed. 5 years ago we were at the end of the previous era of Lee, Ramirez, Soriano, and Zambrano. We've finally gotten rid of all those guys and have a solid year or 2 of rebuilding under our belts. \n The top players are Anthony Rizzo and Starlin Castro. These guys did not live up to expectations last year after both being inked to long term big money deals. They are seen as the future of our organization at first and shortstop respectively (although Castro and the prospect Baez currently play the same position, so that will be something to watch). Our ace pitcher is Jeff Smmmmshark (see also: my flair). He is also relatively young and now signed to a nice contract. He may or may not be the ace of the future depending if he takes the next step forward, but at least he looks like a solid big league starter. \n Pessimism for the season is not hard to come up with, we are projected to be the third worst team in the league, which is about on par with where we've been the last two years. Our offense over the last few years has been really lacking, we score most of our runs off of home runs but we don't hit a lot of home runs. We really lack clutch hitting, we leave runners on, and a lot of times those runs we leave out there are the difference for our pitching staff. The starting rotation is generally good, but can only do so much with no run support. The bullpen is questionable, and for this year that is where the most question marks lie. \n The main story surrounding the cubs over the last few years is the front office. Can Jed Hoyer and Theo Epstein break the Cubs curse as they did with Boston and the curse of the Bambino? It remains to be seen, but they are taking the same methodical approach. \n As far as general cubs information, the history of the club is the most important thing to know about the cubs, possibly more important than who is on the field right now (especially because that can change quickly these days). Baseball history and the Cubs are more closely linked than all but a few franchises, as we are one of the senior members of the circuit and play in the second oldest stadium. Our stadium, up to this year, had an even older feel than any other stadium (including the oldest, Fenway) because of its notable lack of a jumbotron screen and because of it's famous characteristics of its large manual scoreboard and ivy covered walls. It's the 100th anniversary of the stadium this year, and the new owners are putting in a jumbotron and lots more advertising. Apparently this is something that is required to win a world series. \n The Cubs haven't won a world series in over 100 years. 1908 we were world champs and then 1909 we made it back and didn't win. Then we began the drought, we made a few appearances but never won (we lost to Babe Ruth on the called shot, famously, for example). In the 40s we made it to the series, but a curse was put on us by some guy who owned the now famous Billy Goat Tavern. He put a hex on (Wrigley?/)the Cubs because they wouldn't let him bring his goat into the stadium and we lost the series and have not been to a world series since. There have been other manifestations of the curse with the black cat in 69 against the mets and the bartman ball in 2003. \n edit:": "Cubs",

            "It was revealed a while back that in TWOW Sansa is going to do some sort of morally objectionable act that might not sit well with the fans. Not sure how much this has been talked about on here, but an idea came to me today. \n I'm doing my reread of A Storm of Swords and, while I'm not there yet, I'm constantly aware while reading Catelyn's chapters that the Red Wedding is fast approaching. In the books, as far as I can remember, following the wedding the Blackfish and Jeyne Westerling disappear. We don't know where they are, but we can reasonably assume they get away and are in hiding. \n On top of this I was comparing how that scene played out on the show. I understand the show isn't canon, but it stands to reason that if Robb's wife on the show was killed off then she is likely to die in the books as well. Again, not canon, all speculation, etc., I get it. Just hypothesizing. \n Anyway, enter Sansa. She's coming down from the Eyrie for the winter to the Vale of Arryn, and who does she find there but her dear great-uncle and sister-in-law, growing heavy with child. We as readers have sort of picked up on the idea that Sansa is learning to play \"the game\" and is learning from one of the best in Littlefinger. \n Now we get to my idea. Sansa is going to recognize that, with her brother dead, the unborn child is the heir to the North. However, Sansa is soon to be lady regent of the Vale if Littlefinger's plan works out, plus she has a (somewhat distant) claim to Riverrun. My thinking is that maybe Sansa will dispose of Jeyne in some way or another, thus solidifying her claim to three realms. \n Kind of tin-foily, and certainly not supported by the books, but it stands to reason that if Jeyne wasn't dead or going to be killed at some point then they wouldn't have killed her on the show. \n Of course, you could also assume that if they knew she would be killed by Sansa then they probably would have spared her for that. \n I don't know, it was just a thought I had and it seemed like a fun idea to entertain so I wanted to share it with you.

            "Sorry for the wall of text, but here goes! \n I'm still somewhat in the formative stages of my worldbuilding. I'm ultimately hoping to turn all this into a novel, so I'm juggling plot and setting so that slows things down a bit. \n Anyway, my era is primarily medieval but with some touches of pre-industrial technology here and there, mostly in the form of machinery. I guess a parallel could be made to the Dwemmer ruins in the Elder Scrolls games. \n The political aspects are taking me longer to work out than most other parts of the story. One of my main inspirations is the political revolutions occurring in the Germanic states in the 1800s. Bismarck was a very interesting political figure and the way he dealt with opposing forces in the newly-unified German state was impressive. I really like German culture and the diversity in the Germanic states is interesting to me, considering that prior to 1815 there were more than 300 sovereign states spread across present-day Germany, Poland, Austria, France, Switzerland, Italy, Czech Republic, etc., and that they were mainly just linked by a common language and cultural tradition. I wanted to take this sort of diversity, minimize it for ease of reading and writing, and make a story out of it. \n So with that in mind, the political system I'm working on will be a similar to a constitutional monarchy, though the sovereign will retain a lot of his or her powers. The parliament/senate/assembly will be bicameral- the upper house will be made up of the elected and/or hereditary leaders of each province, plus certain advisors and leaders appointed by the monarch. The lower house will be made up of smaller lords and nobles and lesser elected officials. The upper house will deal with issues pertaining to foreign affairs, inter-provincial and -national commerce, and large-scale governance, while the lower house will deal with taxation, roads, and just general municipal affairs. Basically, high politics versus low politics. \n The trick here is to create characters that fit into the system and will know how to manipulate it and create intrigue. The story will sort of jump into a period where there are pressures for unification from some factions, while others want to maintain their historical autonomy. Internal struggles, mixed with pressures from competing nations/kingdoms, my equivalents to France, Britain, Russia, etc., and some other things I've thrown in on my own, should hopefully make for an interesting story.": "worldbuilding",

In the days of FFP this is becoming more and more important. \n I also think it helps the club's image because we're showing ambition to move beyond being a \"splash the cash on established talent\" club and becoming one that promotes from within and supplements from the outside in other positions.

            "1a. Yes, quite a few. All of them unpublished, and most of them young. \n 1b. Not yet. \n 2a. I'm not sure what you mean by \"writing issues\". A failure to finish projects? Imperfect grammar? If that's the sort of thing you mean, then definitely yes. Most new writers have a handful of bad/lazy habits they need to train themselves out of, which can only be done with practice. \n 2b. Many writers have backlists (unpublished novels no one wanted at the time) that they edit and publish once they get their foot in the door (whether with traditional publishers or indie publishing), so that the quality of older works is roughly equal to the quality of the piece that got them some attention. Brandon Sanderson comes to mind: I think he wrote...6? 9? novels before he got one accepted. Now some of those \"old\" novels are in print. Unless I'm thinking of someone else. \n Volume isn't more important than quality. It's more visible.  Readers can't buy your second book if you haven't written it, no matter how much they adored your first book. \n There is a point at which you should say to yourself, \"This is the best I can make it right now. This is the finest product my current skill set can produce.\" And move on to other projects, in order to practice honing your skills. Like with weight-lifting, doing all your reps, every day, forever, at 120 lbs might get you toned, but if you really want to improve, you'll need to leave that weight limit behind and lift 140 lbs.": "writing"

            "Recently I posted my side project website / web app  Recall  in response to [this post]( about getting back into a long book series after a hiatus and forgetting a lot of the details that happened in the previous books. \n &nbsp; \n I received a ton of amazing positive encouragement and feedback. So I started to work on all of the suggestions others gave me about the site and I think it is now in a really good place to share around a little more to see what people from other areas think of the it and to look for more feedback as well as more activity. \n &nbsp; \n I would love to get the dark tower series on the site. I read it a few years back and loved it. \n &nbsp; \n Here is a summary of features and ideas that I was going for. I think the readers of this subreddit would benefit and enjoy using this tool as much as other who have seen it so far so I wanted to share it with you. \n \n The site is built on the idea of  chapter summaries  rather than a whole book summary. Each chapter usually has at least one important idea or plot point otherwise why is it in the book. So for each chapter the user will fill out a very short summary of the important points. They can be as short or as long as you feel is needed. \n \n That being said the site is flexible to allow for basically any kind of summary you want to create. Want to only break down the book into a few sections? Go nuts. Call each section what you want and write what you want. Want to just have one block of text for the whole book? Nothing stopping you. \n &nbsp; \n The site is pretty new so there is a lack of content, [but if we each add a little]( here and there I feel that the site could be a great tool for everyone. Go do a search for your favorite book and see if it is in the system yet. If not, go ahead and add it in and start a new summary for it on your next read through. \n A few cool features about the site: \n \n Users can  vote on each summary  (I wonder where that idea came from) so the best summaries will float to the top of each book. \n \n You can  export any summary as an ebook  to keep for later and add to your library so you dont have to search for it again when the next book in the series comes out. You can also  favorite summaries  to keep in a list on your profile page for easy access later. \n \n If you add each main character to the chapter you can then  sort the summary by character  and only see chapters where that character is involved. This also allows other users to search for the book by characters as well as book title or author. \n \n When creating an account on the site, if you leave the picture blank you will be assigned a random color and animal icon. They're pretty cute, create a user and see what you get on your profile page. Or you can upload your own picture for a more personal touch. \n \n The site was built to be very mobile friendly. It should work great on any device. \n \n Request a summary  by clicking on the \"requests\" count on the bottom right corner of the book to add your vote for a summary of that book. Then you can search by most requested books and see what people want the most and possibly write the summary people are looking for and be a hero to many. \n \n View / Download count  See how many people are viewing and downloading your summaries on your profile page \n \n Flair  Certain milestones will add small icons next to your account picture to show off your contributions to the site. Currently you will get the \"beta tester\" flair for signing up and supporting the site from the very beginning. \n \n Verified Author  flair can be added to an author who provides proof that they are who they say they are. Then users can see that the author them self has written a summary on their own work. Michael J. Sullivan has started doing that for his book \"Theft of Swords\" on the site. Check it out  here \n \n Featured Summaries  There can be a featured summary on the home page to drive more people to get acquainted with the book or perhaps promote a new book in a series coming out soon by encouraging people to catch up on the series before the new book hits shelves. \n \n Save chapters as draft  if you started working on a summary, but don't have time to finish it right away and don't want users to see your unfinished work. Then come back later, finish your summary and post it for others to see. \n \n \n I am the only developer on this thing, but I have tried to implement as many ideas from contributors to the site as I can. Some features are still coming in the future, but I would love more feedback to make this thing what the users want it to be. \n I really think this site has potential to be a great tool in the future, but right now it is pretty bare. It needs people who love reading to join and contribute to make it a real success. \n Please let me know what you think! \n Thanks for reading!": "stephenking",

            "If you don't know what [Recall]( is. [This post]( is where I originally posted info about it. \n After another long week of development  Recall  users. I want to thank you all again for trying out the site and letting me know what you think. Many improvements and ideas came from the users here in this subreddit. \n New Features \n \n Profile Page  - This one was probably the most requested features both directly as well as indirectly asking for featured that would require such a page. It's up now and you can go see your summaries, your favorites and the books you have added. \n \n Things that go along with the new profile page \n \n User Edit  - You can now edit your user \n \n Favorites  - You can now save summaries to your favorites list. These will show up on your profile page. \n \n View & Download Counts  - I am now tracking views and downloads to show off on the profile page. Also these can be used on the main page for new search options. \n \n Edit Book  - if you added a book, you now can edit that book if you made a mistake or want to add new info. \n \n \n (side note: I was not able to link all books to the users who created them because I was not saving that data before now. So if you added a book and dont see it on your list in your profile and you want it there just PM me your username on the site and what book you added and I will link it up for you. Going forward this will be done automatically) \n Other Features \n \n UI Update  - Most buttons how have text along with the icons. This should clear up some of the confusion going on at times. \n \n New Search Options  - The main search areas how have more options. Search by most view, or hot to see what people are looking at the most right now. Or search by most recently having added a new chapter. \n \n Requests  - You can now request a summary by searching for a book and clicking on the request count in the bottom left corner. Then summary writers or authors can search by most requested to see what the people want.  (perhaps in the future there will be a bounty system for fulfilling a request...) \n \n Featured Summary  A summary can be featured on the homepage perhaps to coincide with the upcoming release of a new book. This should highlight the summary and help users catch up on the series before a new release as well as help promote new books that are releasing soon. \n \n \n There is still a big lack of content, but that will come with time. If we all start working on things, in a little while we can have an awesome tool we can all use. After this round of use from the awesome people here I plan on posting the site on many more subreddits and other places around the web to get more traffic and users contributing to make the most out of the site in the future. \n Final note, the 'beta tester' flair will probably end soon so sign up now if you want that flair on your account.": "Fantasy",

            "I think in cases like these one has to be careful not to be anachronistic. \n Hume's argument may appear to agree with atomic theory on the surface, but they really are two very different things. Hume almost certainly did not have atoms in mind. \n \"Substance\" in the rationalist tradition doesn't really mean matter in any modern conception. It's a somewhat more metaphysical/religious idea. Substance is the thing that constitutes the basis of reality. It's the essence of stuff, of being. For example in Spinoza, substance = God, because he was pantheist. \n So when Hume denied substance, he wasn't really saying anything about what makes up matter as we understand it now. The fact that atoms are mostly empty space doesn't affect it much - even that empty space has being (spacial dimension). \n And note that even if Hume were talking about atoms, he'd be very wrong. While atoms are mostly \"empty space\", you do still have the nucleus and electrons (though I believe that is a significant simplification, as the subatomic particles that make up atoms aren't really little balls flying around. Much of that so-called empty space will be part of the electron cloud). \n This is all connected to the idea of dualism. Descartes' philosophy had two substances: mental substance and extended substance (physical stuff). Spinoza thought there was a problem with that - namely how the two interacted if they were of different substances, so conceived of the world as consisting of just one substance, which was god. And then Hume came along and was sceptical of the whole lot. He denied our ability to know the true basis of reality. All we could know was our sense perceptions - phenomena. It was a mistake to infer from these perceptions a lawful reality underlying it all, he thought - the problem of induction. \n And then Kant came along and shewed him what was what.": "philosophy",

            "But HP magic isn't \"magical energy\" -- it isn't energy at all. It doesn't work  with  physics via some special type of energy, it works in spite of physics, overruling what JKR calls \"mundane nature\". \n As for way too fast, you're not thinking of the full range of HP magic. Spells that shoot in a straight line and have to hit their targets are the smallest part of HP magic. For example, transfiguration spells do not shoot through the air, they take immediate effect regardless of where their subjects are in relation to the caster, and can even take effect over a large area on multiple objects simultaneously. \n Further, on the issue of firepower, there's no evidence that physical forces are able to overcome magical shields in HP. We've never seen any HP spell overcome by a physical force, only magical forces, and JKR's extra-book comments generally talk about how magic is completely separate from physical forces and able to completely override them.

            "Salmond is a canny operator. He knows that the average voter does not really understand how currencies and central banks work. He also knows that people don't really fully understand how Parliament works. \n Salmond's primary concern is winning the referendum. So while he knows that these economic and political issues are complex, he also knows that pretending that they're simple and that Scotland has a strong negotiating position will help him win the vote. Once he's won the vote,  then  he can face the difficulties of the reality of an independent Scotland. \n In reality, Scotland has no legal negotiating power at all. Until the Act of Parliament that creates Scottish independence is passed, Scotland remains under the control of Westminster. The powers of the Scottish Parliament are derived from the Westminster Parliament and they retain supremacy in law-making power. \n The upshot of all this is that Westminster is essentially negotiating with itself the terms of an independent Scotland. The Act of Parliament which dictates the terms of Scottish independence will be passed by Westminster Parliament, and thus Westminster MPs decide what it contains. \n Now, Scotland can of course simply declare itself independent and not subject to Westminster. No matter what Act Westminster passed, Scotland could ignore the legal situation and just do whatever they want. No one is going to invade them, as stated. \n But the technical legal situation would still be the Act of Parliament, even if Scotland refused to recognise it, and that's the reality that international markets would follow. Finance depends on the rule of law. \n If Scotland disclaimed responsibility for debt that an Act of Parliament legally passed to them, international markets would treat that as a default. It doesn't matter what argument Scotland uses for why it shouldn't be theirs: legally, it is. \n Similarly, if Scotland tried to \"fake\" a currency union without UK consent, e.g. by setting up their own central bank and saying that the currency it printed was the same as the UK pound, international markets would treat the pound printed by Scotland as a separate currency to that of the UK pound, no matter what Scotland said.": "unitedkingdom",

You still need the chemical process, it's just that for that chemical process to occur the food needs to have the magical \"nutritious\" property.

            "The first thing I considered was immigration. Modern Muggle USA is shaped significantly by immigration from Europe. If the US wizarding society is to be similar to US Muggle society then it's fair to say that the same would have to be true. Now, most people migrated to the US for either economic reasons or idealistic/religious reasons. Would there have been a similar drive in wizarding society? I decided not, at least for my world. \n There were a number of factors leading to no similar migration to the New World. \n Firstly, it presented no significant increase in economic opportunities. Wizards have as much land as they could possibly desire, both due to their low population and ability to warp space. So if wizards wanted more land they could just have it in Europe. \n Secondly, by the time the US was discovered by Europeans (I decided that the Muggles discovered the Americas before the wizards, as wizards have a significantly lower propensity to explore geographically. They're much inward looking, feeling that they have everything they want already.) the Immortality magics were well developed, which meant that the European population was extremely old and therefore more entrenched. \n Thirdly, while wizarding society is extremely classist, most people (other than Muggleborns) didn't feel actively repressed. This can be attributed to a number of sources: firstly, the fact that the nobility had convinced the lower classes of the meritocratic ideal, even if it was a warped meritocratic ideal. The very existence of an entrenched nobility who guarded knowledge to preserve their power defies a meritocracy. Nevertheless, the population at large was convinced of it - not unlike the way many modern Americans remain convinced of the possibility of the \"American Dream\", despite all the barriers against it. Further, life in Europe was pretty good at this time for even those of the lower classes. Wealth and power were flowing into Europe, and especially Britain, following Merlin's Conquest. \n Fourthly, as was mentioned above, the nobility guarded knowledge. Above all, they guarded the Immortality magics. Migrating to the New World meant leaving this centre of expertise. Unless you could cast the spells yourself (in which case you likely were either from the nobility, or on your way to becoming part of that world), moving away was almost like accepting a death sentence. \n So there wasn't a massive migration to the New World. Certainly there was some migration by Muggleborns and people with a chip on their shoulder. But, importantly, this migration was not significant enough to overrun the already existing Native American magical culture. \n So, given this, what does modern US magical culture look like? \n The US population is split about 50/50 in terms of Native American and European ethnicity. Most of the European side isn't from European immigrants but from Muggleborns from the US Muggle culture. \n However, the magical culture is very much dominated by the Native Americans. The European side has drifted in so slowly over the years that they got absorbed into the Native American culture rather than overriding it. Further, the Immortality magics took a long time to reach North America, and when they did the magical people there rejected them as unnatural. On the other hand, the Europeans were not so scrupulous. They took from the Native American culture everything they thought could be of value. Foremost of these was the secret of how to make Totem Poles, extremely powerful protective objects that the British Legions use to this day. \n US magical culture is very tied in with spirituality, unlike European magical culture. There is no central government, nor are there magical schools in the sense that there are in Europe. Muggleborns are routinely detected and told about magic, but they don't go away to a magical school. Often, they don't even leave home. They'll simply spend time with whoever the local wizards are, learning their ways. They may choose to become fully part of that culture, or continue to live on in the Muggle culture, treating their magic like a religion or hobby. The Statute of Secrecy was not something that US magical culture particularly liked or wanted to enter into. They were essentially forced into it, after seeing the kind of punishment other magical nations had suffered at the hands of international forces for rejecting it. \n US magical culture is therefore very small compared to European culture and uses a very different type of magic. They reject both wands and immortality magic. They are particularly gifted with a unique type of magic involving animals, and have powerful shape-shifting abilities that put the animagus transformation to shame. They also are good at healing magic, divination, and potions, though all of these are meant in a different sense to their European counterparts. US practitioners of magic, however, do not have powerful magic suited for combat. That's not to say they have no magic that can be used to attack people with, it's just that it's a) quite subtle and b) weak compared to wand magic. \n US magical culture is rather overshadowed by a magical superpower to their south, the Mayan civilisation. This is the only civilisation to discover how to make oneself immortal before Europe, though it is not nearly so easy as the European way: the general population is not immortal as is the case for Europe, and so there is a much smaller population (though still quite large compared to canon population). However, the greatest of the Mayans can extend their life indefinitely through ritual sacrifice. These sacrifices also increase these wizards' power. There are wizards in this culture who were alive in 1500BC, and so are far older than their European counterparts. A handful of these wizards are also frighteningly powerful. Only three things prevented a Mayan conquest of Europe: the versatility and power of wand magic, the very large European magical population, and the threat of Merlin. \n The Mayans also rejected European immortality magic and wands, but unlike the Native American wizards, the Mayans have their own extremely powerful magic - powerful enough that they were the only magical nation that Merlin did not risk attempting to subjugate when he created the ICW and the Statute of Secrecy. Rather, an alliance was reached - an alliance which resulted in the complete disappearance of the Mayan civilisation as they were brought into the Statute of Secrecy. This disappearance remains a mystery to modern Muggle academics.": "harrypotter"

            "I have read most of Gaiman's work. \n Firstly, if you have any interest in comics at all, you owe it to yourself to check out his Sandman comics series sometime (he wrote, others illustrated/etc). It is great and wonderful.  That said, those are rather outside the bounds of the this subreddit. \n His work with Pratchett, Good Omens, is a great starting point. It's unique, funny, interesting, and relatively short. That said, the book borrows more from Pratchett stylistically than Gaiman. Of Gaiman's solo works, I'd recommend starting with American Gods. American Gods is one of Gaiman's best works - it has a lot of his best writing in it. Then I'd continue with Gaiman's short stories and poetry in Smoke and Mirrors or Fragile Things. Finally, I would check out his other stuff - he has a couple books that got made into films (Coraline and Stardust) where the book version was superior IMO. He has a TV miniseries called Neverwhere that got turned into a book - the miniseries has better pacing and a sense of urgency and tension that the book lacks (to it's detriment), but the book has a number of elements that didn't make it it into the TV series, so I'd recommend checking out both of them. His Graveyard Book is a modern day homage/adaptation of the Jungle Book, and it's pretty great even for adult readers, so you should go check that out. Finally, Anansi Boys is a sort of followup to American Gods in a way but isn't as good IMO. \n The most favorable qualities of Gaiman's writing: \n 1) Uses language well - stylistically very competent and interesting writing. \n 2) Maintains pacing and structure to all works (short and long) very well. \n 3) Very interesting side characters and non-narrator characters. \n 4) Interesting and unique plot/setting elements, settings, etc. \n 5) Uses a wide variety of different styles of exposition and narration from different viewpoint characters to great effect. \n Bad bits: \n 1) Narrator often (but not always - see e.g. Good Omens) has a narrator who is less interesting than those around him.

            "Discworld Series by Terry Pratchett  \n This was written for newcomers to the series, who may perhaps have heard of it before vaguely but don't know much about it. There are a lot of 'rationalist' themes present in various Discworld books, and as such some of those books are very definitely worth a read for people interested in 'rational' literature. \n MOST of Terry Pratchett's work qualifies as deconstructionist - deconstructing and subverting popular tropes of everything from genre fantasy to modern day institutions to popular culture of all sorts \n Finally, most of Pratchett's books are really worth reading, even those non-rationalist books. The worst of them is 'decent and readable', while the best are some of the funniest, most poignant, and most intelligent fantasy ever written in English. It's really good stuff, in short. \n For reference, the big chart of suggested [Discworld reading order]( is a really good resource when deciding what to read next. \n For a rationalist, there are two main series that are rationalist in some sense - the Watch series and, to a lesser extent, the Witches series. That said, the best entry point for the books as a whole for general reading is Small Gods. Small Gods is a mostly independent novel from the rest of the series, and the characters and specific location within the overall setting are not revisited, making it a good book to read at any point; it also is extremely strongly written and interesting. There is some interesting analysis of how a phenomenon similar to the LW affective death spiral causes an organization to become devoted to self-perpetuation over it's nominal goal, and some interesting commentary on religion as well as some interesting planning and plotting, but it's not very rationalist overall. \n From there, arguably the most rationalist and one of the most interesting sets of stories is the Watch Novels, starting with Guards! Guards! In these novels, each novel is mostly structured as a mystery, and opportunities for the author to drop hints beforehand, and for characters to figure things out, both abound - the stories are mostly (with exceptions being to some extent the first and the last two last books) puzzles that can be solved beforehand. Night Watch in particular is exceptionally well-written, and if not extremely rationalist in terms of being a puzzle-solving plot it does show an intelligent protagonist using limited resources very effectively. \n One warning: Other than the Watch books, the first book (or in the case of the Rincewind books, first two or even arguably three books) are weaker than the others in their set. They were written at the start of the Discworld, before Pratchett had as firmly defined setting elements and style, and it causes them to be off-putting. However, if you get to (Faust) Eric, Witches Abroad, Soul Music, or The Truth and are still not enjoying yourself, you should probably give up on that sub-series entirely. \n The Witches books have some rationalist elements as well. In particular, some of the characters are particularly keen observers of human nature and illustrate vividly how people tend to think, albeit not in particularly scientific terms. They are not usually puzzles or mysteries, though, with the noticeable exception of Maskerade, which definitely is. These often examine and deconstruct the intersection between fiction and people, i.e. how people's beliefs and thoughts in/about fiction influence them. \n The Rincewind novels are entertaining but basically antirationalist - everything is madcap adventures of an incompetent wizard, who gets through by luck rather than skill, and who has no ability to be predicted beforehand because nothing is foreshadowed. Can occasionally be really funny, but not nearly as easy to recommend as the other series. \n The Death novels are somewhat interesting from a transhumanist perspective as a portrayal of death in a not-strictly-negative light, but again are not particularly puzzles and often don't have any particularly illuminating bits about human thought/nature. They are often gorgeously written, however, and are definitely worth a read on that basis alone. \n The Industrial Revolution is mostly quite standalone, and in that series The Truth stands out as being particularly rationalist in terms of being a puzzle to solve. To a lesser extent, so is Going Postal. Both are defined by protagonists who intelligently use resources to solve problems. \n Of Pratchett's non-discworld books, Strata and Dark Side of the Sun are both sci-fi adventures that imitate Rincewind in lack of foreshadowing and predictability in favor of luck and random chance, and are not really worth reading, being substantially clumsier in execution. Good Omens is an amazing collaboration between Pratchett and Gaiman, but the target of a great deal of it's deconstruction (mainly Christian escatology, with some general Christian theology) is the sort of thing that most readers of this review already don't bother to even consider taking seriously. However, it is some of the most funny and amazingly well-written fiction Pratchett ever produced, so I strongly recommend Good Omens. The fact the overall message of Good Omens is very pro-humanist helps. Pratchett's remaining works are mostly ignorable, but Nation in particular is probably worth a read. \n Suggested 'most rationalist' books: \n \n Guards! Guards! \n \n Men At Arms! \n \n Feet of Clay \n \n Jingo \n \n The Fifth Elephant \n \n Maskerade \n \n The Truth \n \n Going Postal \n \n \n However, most of the non-rationalist books are still definitely worth a read, and not reading them would IMO be a mistake. \n The last few Discworld books (starting with Unseen Academicals, IMO) are not up to par with earlier books. I suspect this is as a consequence of Terry Pratchett's early onset Alzheimers. \n The Science of the Discworld books aren't anything special - they offer no insight that is not offered better elsewhere in the nonfiction segments, and the attached fiction segments aren't particularly well written. That said, if you haven't read any popular science books before they may have something interesting to offer you.": "rational",

Choose one and stick to it - I prefer lower case. \n \"shouted Sakura, angry at having waited for their tardy sensei for three hours.\"\nFirstly, you just spent a multi-line paragraph explaining why they were angry directly before this. If you hadn't done that, this would be sort of acceptable - but here it's just very redundant. \n \"Snarled naruto, this was\" - Firstly, comma splice. Secondly - really, snarling at him? \n \"Their angry features mirroring Naruto's own.\" Sentence fragment, revise to \"mirrored\" instead. \n \"boring at him\" Would be a lot better as \"boring into him\". \n \"Kakashi then went on to explain the bell test and that they would begin immediately. Sasuke and Sakura immediately went into hiding. Kakashi took out his porn and seemed to begin reading.\" More of this passive voice stuff. \n \"Naruto convinced Sasuke and Sakura to help get the bells per the agreement that both of them would get one. Sasuke and Sakura were curious as to why Naruto would decide to just give-up so easily but chalked it up for their own reasons. Sasuke, frankly, didn't care. Sakura assumed it was because he lacked dreams like her and Sasuke.\" More of this passive voice stuff. Not sure why 'give-up' is hyphenated. \n \"Sasuke soon joined them in attack Kakashi\" Attack should be attacking. \n \"They honestly were a poultry amount and C-rank missions would garner them both a higher paycheck.\". 'poultry' should be 'paltry'. \n \"fed-up\" More mystery hyphens. \n At this point I decided to stop reading with any focus on spelling and grammar. This does not mean the relative frequency of such errors decreased. Get an editor/beta reader, or do careful editing yourself. It just got tedious typing them all out.  Rest assured, there's lots more random hyphenation, grammar errors, and questionable decisions in overall style in the writing style later on in the chapter. \n Check out TVTropes on Said Bookisms, your dialogue writing seems to suffer from these occasionally. \n The plot: \n Thank you, first of all, for getting the Obligatory Wave Arc (always a long and boring piece of writing which everyone has seen far too much of) over (relatively) quickly. That arc was vital to canon Naruto's opening, but it's always a slog to get through if you try to pace it like canon Naruto did. \n I have read a bunch of Naruto fanfics, this introductory scene wasn't even that interesting when it happened originally in canon, it remains sort of boring here. \n Secondly, I have no idea where you are going with this. Naruto seems extraordinarly different from canon and far more knowledgeable, far more competent, and far more skillful/powerful. Super!Naruto for no reason, basically. I don't particularly know why exactly he's Super!Naruto, and I find I don't particularly care. And everything so far in the story was basically \"Canon Naruto, but with Super!Naruto.\" \n Why does Sakura have this total hatred of Naruto if he's basically completely different (as characterized here) than he was in canon? Presumably he's not been incessantly pursuing her romantically? Speaking of which, reading about a 12 year old child having a girlfriend or, in his own words, \"lover\" is fucking creepy. Remember that this is a character equivalent in age to a SIXTH GRADER. I know it's not unknown in fanfiction, but it is still super creepy to envision for someone as old as Harry Potter was in The Chamber of Secrets. \n I have no real impetus to continue reading the story. I hit the end of the chapter, and as far as I can tell events were basically \"Canon, but Super!Naruto removed tension by being far more powerful than before while everything else was the same\". I don't really have any strong reason to read the Chuunin exam arc which will inevitably come next (haven't looked, just guessing) because I've already seen/read canon Naruto and having a very similar thing with Super!Naruto instead is basically not interesting to me - there are a thousand other fics that already do that and aren't full of spelling and grammar problems. \n Basically, there's nothing that stands out as good or as a virtue of the story. There's no really funny bits. There are no really dramatic intense moments. I was never particularly sad, or happy, or scared, or amused. It was written as if the author was not trying to evoke any sort of emotions from the reader, but was instead just trying to move on the plot as fast as possible so they could get to the next bit - and all the bits are basically \"canon Naruto, but with less tension\", so it leaves me wondering why you actually included the bulk of this chapter at all instead of starting your story where the actual part you wanted to write happens. \n Matters of taste: \n Matter of taste: Sweatdropping. As in \"Sakura sweatdropped.\" I strong dislike this, 'facefaulting', and all the other similar \"make my story read like a screenplay for an anime/manga\" elements. This is entirely a matter of taste, but it's a fairly strong one for me. Think about if you want to constantly remind the reader that these are characters from a manga or anime series rather than actual people. \n Matter of taste: Gratuitous Japanese. I tend to feel that things should be fully translated and localized or not translated at all. In your fic, you randomly sometimes put suffixes on names but not at other times, using Sensei and Bento and a few other bits of gratuitous japanese, etc. I prefer not doing this. However, I feel if you ARE doing this sort of thing, it scans better if you use them more consistently in your characters' dialogue rather than including them only semi randomly. This is because NOT using a suffix has a strong and important connotation in japanese culture (either you're really intimately close or you're basically actively trying to be insulting) which is usually not something the author intends. Something to think on. \n Matter of taste: I have elsewhere seen \"deadlast\" used as a portmanteau to be a translation of dobe. I don't like it here either - I would prefer at least a space between the words.": "rational"

It would hurt Joe, it would hurt everyone around him, and absolutely no one would be helped. \n If Joe then decides to tell the truth, he's a bastard bound to his principles - and that's going to cause repercussions that are going to force him to make a bunch of choices, through which he'll learn. \n If he decides to lie, then you have complexity of character. \n \n Another approach is to make Joe's penchant for honesty irrelevant. Joe always tells the truth... but he's put in a scene that gives him no opportunity to lie OR tell the truth. How does his steely will to truth-tell affect what he does when he sees a car careening toward a nine-year-old girl? It does, but in oblique ways. If he believes that telling the truth is demanded by honor, then he's a strongly honorable person, and he saves the girl or dies trying. If he believes that telling the truth is practical because you can't be caught lying, then he's a pragmatist and he's going to evaluate the situation. If he believes that telling the truth is valuable mostly for the reactions, then he's kind of an ass and he might not save the girl. \n \n Which leads to another thing - if a character is an avatar of something, it came from somewhere else.

The sign bounced around in my head for most of my walk, and as I reached my office it had turned into the girl stopping {character} and saying \"Remember Eleven.\" And other people stopping {character} all over the city to say the same thing. \n From there I filled out who he was (some sort of psychic attractant) and who he worked with (a team of people responsible for preventing the apocalypse)... \n And then I started brainstorming more, and the whole thing fell apart and recongealed into a novel. About the only thing kept was the idea of the team and the title, morphed into a thematic question - what is the 'best\" way to deal with trauma you've gone through in your past? From there I built out the character's backstory, built a magic system, found along the way that I wanted to write a series, and that the series would in part be an examination of the ways corporations impact life in current society... that led to an antagonist, whose goals led me to more worldbuilding and magic-system building... at some point I took a position on my thematic question, and that gave me the ending. \n So now I had characters and an ending. Which meant, in a way, that I had a beginning - I had a character who was going to learn that repressing one's guilt over trauma doesn't actually help things. So that meant that he had to start out repressing things, right? So from there I did the notecard thing, just throwing random scene ideas  down as quickly as I could. Some were related to one another, some not. I tried to keep them related to the theme, however loosely, either in support or opposition to the position I'm taking. Outside of that, it was just whatever I could think of that would be cool given the magic system and other setup stuff. \n And then I started arranging those scenes, throwing out the ones that didn't fit... \n When I was done, I had a pretty tight outline. That, after I started writing, I realized wasn't going to work at all. \n So I kept the key scenes in the outline - the one where the MC gets involved, the one where the antagonist shows up, a few where the antagonist plies his antagonism, the ending, a few more... and tossed the rest.

Basically, once I build a basic outline for the story on index cards (or the Scrivener equivalent), I'm doing a real fast draft with minimal descriptions--more telling what people see and do and hear than writing out the scene--and a first cut at the dialog. Then, before I write it in \"real\" form, I'm editing that, instead of the written-out first draft--I'm finding it really improves my ability to step back and see what the story's doing, and gives me some ideas on how to fix its problems. It changes going into the first draft, of course, gets filled out and the dialog changes and whatnot.

They are both white. They are both equally, highly intelligent. They are starting first grade. \n Bill has 2 parents. His dad works a well-paid 9-5 office job. His mother works 8 am to 3 pm at another well-paid office job. \n Bill comes home to a clean home, a parent waiting to help him study, and a full meal in his belly. He goes to bed at a reasonable time, and wakes up to a good breakfast, and both parents home to make sure he gets all his things together for school. \n Ted's parents are divorced. His dad remarried and has no interest in him, and has fallen behind on child support. Ted's mom has to work 2 jobs to pay the rent.  Ted comes home, if he's lucky, to a babysitter who tosses some pizza rolls in the microwave and sends him off to his room. \n She tells him to go to bed, but he's six, and she's not paying attention, so he's usually up until his mom gets home around midnight. \n In the morning, she has to drop him at school too early, on the way to work, so mornings are rushed. If he's lucky, he gets a poptart and remembers his backpack. If not... well he ends up with a lot of zeros on take home assignments.  The school serves breakfast, which he may or may not make it to school in time for, since his mom is on the city bus. \n When he does get breakfast, it's usually sugary cereal because public school breakfasts offer that option, are largely unsupervised and well, he's  six . \n Because Bill gets plenty of sleep, eats well, and has parents helping him learn at home, he's able to be alert and attentive in class, does well on his schoolwork, and learns what he needs to do well  next year . \n Even though Ted is  just as smart , he is sleep deprived, malnourished, and has no outside help. He falls asleep in class, or his mind wanders to lunch, and he doesn't learn everything he needs to do well next year. \n Either he's held back, in which case he's now a year behind Bill, or he's allowed to move on to second grade, where he cannot do the work because he's unprepared. \n Most often, conditions won't improve for Ted, but  even if they do  he's still starting behind Bill. \n They do not have  equal  opportunity, because Bill has advantages Ted does not have. \n So people start a program. Anyone who doesn't have parents to help them at home can come in for free tutoring, breakfast, dinner, life skills (like getting enough sleep!) ... Each of these classes/programs is geared to getting TEDS on even starting ground with BILLS. \n If Bill takes these courses too, he's STILL ahead of Ted. \n Usually, Bill won't, because they say they are for Ted. Most of them would allow Bill anyway. \n So we replace Bill with the average working class white man, back in the 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s, even the 90s, when these programs started being created. His two parent home is his skin color, which, while providing no specific advantages, also doesn't  hinder  him. \n At those same times in history, Ted, the average working class black man, had a parental situation (the color of his skin) which did hinder him. Not  everyone  would turn him down for a job because of his skin color, but  some  people would - whereas no one would turn Bill down for his skin color. That's not equal. Same thing went for schools. \n Even beyond that, a larger percentage of black people (due to racism in the past) started out with less than ideal home/financial backgrounds. \n So programs were created to get the Teds of the world into an equal starting position. \n It's supposed to be a temporary measure, where, eventually, there are no \"minorities\" and everyone starts with equal opportunities. \n That wasn't thought through very well, because even if Bill and Ted start out equal, one may make better choices than the other, and their  children  don't start out equal. Or they both make bad choices, or good choices, and their children start off on lower or higher ground than Jim's kids. \n Added to this (because we aren't really talking about children) is the fact that there IS still racism in the world, (although much less of it) and the fact that during the process of integration, much of Ted's  culture  was lost. \n Culture being important to emotional growth (which affects every part of our lives) more groups are formed to celebrate what culture remains. \n Being a controlling majority of the population means that Bill hasn't suffered as much of this loss. He generally doesn't need the hand up to get onto even ground. \n That being said MOST of those organizations will still take Bill - the Caucasian applicant.

They had an assembly  in school  when they were 10. Beyond that, we've had several talks. \n Everyone in that  junior high school  (not elementary at that age) class  knows  what BDSM is. Most of them don't have a \"healthy\" understanding of it, because no one talks to them. They think it's funny, or a way to \"control\" their boyfriends or girlfriends. \n The children at that school, many of them, are having sex. They shouldn't be, but they are. 11, 12, and 13 year olds. \n These are the realities of the age and the media. \n I would  never  suggest my child go as a character from this book. I realize that makes me a hypocrite, since, as a horror fan family, we consistently work on serial killer costumes and monster costumes and so on. \n Why do I make the distinction? Because the kids at the school  know  killing is wrong, and why. They don't (most of them) understand why they shouldn't be having sex yet. \n I would never suggest that. \n If my child came to me, though, and wanted to dress as Grey, I would allow it. Probably not for a school event, because I would have enough common sense to know the  school  wouldn't allow it. \n But for Halloween, or another \"WBD\" event? Certainly I would. \n His body would be covered. He isn't going to demonstrate how to use the ties he carries. \n Especially if, as in this case, it was done as a  joke  to mock the frenzy of mainstream media over a truly (in my opinion) poorly written book. \n I encourage my kids to think for themselves, and to make a statement, when they feel strongly about something. \n And if the school is going to forbid  any  costumes for any reason, they should have stated, explicitly that any \"overtly sexualized\" characters are disallowed,  before  some kid got splashed all over the media for his choice.": "books",

            "I... agree, in part... Which is strange because I'm pretty much an \"everything sucks\" sort of asshole over on RDR. Then again I also started a sub to encourage the little guys, so I can't be all bad, right? :/ \n My thing is this... It depends on the venue. \n I think we're all so accustomed to the internet platforms you  have  to be on as a writer today, that we forget where critics came from. \n We ask for critiques when what we really want is encouragement and an editor. \n And an editor  is  a type of critic - but not the kind everyone thinks of. \n I remember every \"movie review\" or \"book review\" in the paper growing up, and it was \"This was the worst piece of trash I ever read\" and \"6 thumbs wayyyyy down\" and \"don't waste your time with this movie.\" \n Some were good, of course, but the columns you could really trust? They didn't pull punches, and they didn't always stick to technical stuff with the work. \n A critic isn't your cheerleader. A critic should be honest. If they hate your vision, they hate it. They shouldn't have to lie. \n But they shouldn't tell you you're a dipshit who should never write again, either. \n If you go to a venue that's open and encouraging and someone trounces you and your story - that's painful. And wrong. There's a way critiques are handled on, say /r/keepwriting, or the weekly critique thread here, that is very different from, say /r/destructivereaders. \n I post honest feedback on both, but I'm way more intense (assholish) on RDR. It's not the critic's - or the sub/venue's responsibility to assuage your ego, or decide what you can handle as a writer. It's yours. \n If you know that one random asshole can break you - don't go where assholes critique. \n There are people who  need  those assholes. I'm one of them. I need someone to bash my face into every mistake and say \"See? See TK, you worthless piece of wanna-be filth? THIS is what you're doing wrong!\" \n And then I say \"oh.\" and I  fix  it. \n Most people don't need that, but some do. \n So... Idk. I think it depends on the time and the place - and both people. \n Cause despite my  vehement  opinions on the subject - I've really tamed things down on RDR for a writer who seemed tentative. I've amped it up on other sites for writers who seemed a bit smug. \n But I shouldn't have to change my critique for each writer because  I don't know you . \n The \"guidelines to follow with critique\" change from company to company, site to site, and sub to sub. \n Unless you're talking about industry standards through an  actual business , then no, they aren't always the same. \n It's ultimately - whether the critique is good or bad (and I do agree that there are bad critiques) - up to the writer to decide what information to take from it, or leave as it stands. \n And I completely disagree about the thickness of skin. I've seen people break down in tears over a notation that a comma placement is wrong. Some people are thin skinned no matter if it's focused on the work or not. \n Some people (me) are thick skinned, and can take whatever you throw at them. \n And whether a critic  should  be harsh or not doesn't really matter. As writers, we  will  encounter an asshole at some point. There will always be assholes. If you can take it, you can take it. If you can't, you'll either give up or you'll get over it. And which you choose is entirely up to you. But you will encounter an asshole at some point. \n I think rather than focusing on the critic (good or bad) it's more important for the writers of the world to learn  how  to handle those critiques. \n How to know if the critic  gets  your vision. \n How to find the nuggets of truth in what the assholes say. \n How to elicit honesty from your cheerleaders. \n Whether your ideas click with your editor's. \n When and why it's okay to make an exception to a rule, and what is a rule vs something subjective. \n >A good critic is an unabashed cheerleader of your artistic vision, even at the expense of your personal pride. \n No. \n A good critic is honest about your artistic vision, even at the expense of your personal pride. \n Preferably without insulting you as a person.": "writing",

            "Generally my preferred reason for us not going the Singularity route is exactly the sort of extreme event you specify, and it could really come from any number of things. I think the only thing that would stop us from flipping the \"On\" switch is the switch not being built in the first place - we're curious little primates, and there are few areas where we won't go in the name of discovery. This goes triple for scientists, who are enormously ethical and farsighted in many matters, but are bound by personality and institutional constraints to seek and test the boundaries of knowledge. Simply put, there's someone who would say \"Damn the consequences, we have to  know! \" \n In general, it's the issue of stopping or slowing research. Enough conflict breaks out, and research into singularity-developing technology will probably decline - and even if it accelerates (because of military pressures for things like AI, robotics, and bioresearch, all of which are heavily financed in the US by DARPA, among others), the resource focus will have switched from technological innovation to warfare: guns, not butter. Without the fertile business and research environment created by the modern globalized economy, Moore's law no longer holds. Without that, the Singularity is averted or delayed. \n Here are a few scenarios that might get us there, in no particular order or likelihood: \n Climate Change \n As anthropomorphic climate change takes hold, resource endowments will change or shrink, weather patterns will generally become more energetic, and some densely populated regions of the planet will become less and less inhabitable as time goes on. The pressures this creates could reverse the international security gains of the last six decades and create regional and possibly global conflict. My money's on Pakistan/India/China/North Korea for setting off the nuke heard 'round the world, unless something very interesting happens in Russia or the UK (US gets an honorable mention because we tend to react irrationally when certain things get in our way, but that same irrationality would probably still block a first strike IMO - our national self-image doesn't like the idea much). \n Economic Collapse \n The modern economy requires a few things to sustain the conditions that have brought us technological growth at the rate predicted by Moore's law. The intricate supply chain that supplies researchers with the ability to build more complex machines is distributed across the planet. If that chain is disrupted at any point - embargo where heavy metals are mined, labor riots in the developing world where chips are created, unsafe sealanes between economic centers, or diffuse economic hardships that dry up private and public spending on research - make it likely that singularity research slows down. I say slow down, because the system can adjust with some discomfort to singular events. It's much more likely, however, that a full-on Depression in the United States or Europe could collapse several conditions simultaneously, requiring such an extensive restructuring of economies and societies that the Singularity could be pushed back decades. \n A Dark Age \n I leave this one for last because I really, really don't want it to be true. The sad fact is, while science has advanced by leaps and bounds, most of those gains are very fragile and often very new - meaning the most advanced science is only taught to people still in schools. Most of our information is stored in electronic form now, making it exceptionally easy to destroy - or replicate - at will. Our technology is very, very advanced, but the underlying science it is built on is largely specialized and beyond most of the educated members of our society. If the above scenarios play out poorly and the global society we've built in the last century collapses, we could experience a dark age where we actually regress technologically. The fact that we have archives that store much of our progress in much of the developing world is the reason I hesitate to espouse this position, but if a CBRN-based collapse scenario occurs, we might lose enough of our population and enough of the developed world's infrastructure to lose significant knowledge bases - chemistry, medicine, microbiology, applied mathematics, quantum physics - they are the domain of 1% of our population. If our libraries are burned in a nuclear holocaust or 95% of our population is successively killed over generations by bioweapons to the point where it becomes difficult (or more frightening - not worth our while) to teach people how to read, or teach abstract non-survival skills, we experience a Dark Age. I like to think that it would be a short one since some knowledge, somewhere, would likely survive, but given the wide parameters of the problem it would be hard to tell.": "singularity",
            "Alright, I'll bite. \n First things first: as a gay male, my perspective on this is  very  constrained. I'll never have to face the decision to keep or terminate an unplanned pregnancy, as either the father or (obviously) the mother. So my voice should not carry any special weight in the matter - I've never been there, and I never will. Someone in my position might well be opposed to abortion on personal, ulterior grounds: more infants available for adoption means a greater supply for gay couples who want a family, which is by far the easiest option for most men in my position. I disagree with this perspective, because it's selfish and because it doesn't consider the \"whole problem.\" I try avoid the former and succeed in the latter below. \n So I'll try to address this in the order which you proposed. It's not comprehensive, but it's long, so that will have to suffice. \n 1) Policy should always take into account morality, or at the very least, ethics. However, in this case, it is morally unclear and ethically inconclusive about whether abortion is \"wrong.\" Then again, people like to pick fights about all sorts of things and defend it with morality, so we're not going to be able to rely on consensus as a way to solve this particular problem. It's a deeply held, personal belief - based on ethical and moral principles. Given that, and the strong feelings on both sides, I favor the freedom to choose one's own morality: just as we have freedom of religion in the United States, we have ethical and moral freedom. I o not personally consider abortion to be immoral in many cases, and given that, I am more willing to support free elective abortion over restricted or banned abortion. More on that later. \n 2) I think that as a society we should do what we can to reduce abortions, because it is  always  a terrible, difficult choice. I think that the best way to do it, however, is to reduce the  need  for abortions, not their availability, because . . . \n 3) If we banned abortions or made them illegal, they wouldn't go away - they'd just get more dangerous. Abortions happen for a variety of reasons - almost as many reasons as people get pregnant. The statistics on this are hazy (as are most statistics on illegal activity), but states with more stringent abortion restrictions sometimes have much higher cases of botched black-market abortions. This is less common in states where abortion is more freely available. So, in my mind, a bad on abortion or \"personhood\" law would almost certainly cause more deaths of would-be mothers, with little or no change in the actual demand for abortions  all other things kept equal . \n 4) Comprehensive - and I mean  comprehensive  sexual education, mandatory for anyone who is sexually mature^1, with completely factual medical information, followed by fully legal, destigmatized, and heavily subsidized prophylactic or birth-control methods. This means no taking our kids out of sex-ed, no \"we don't believe in modern medicine,\" and free condoms/IUDs/hormone cycle pills for anyone who wants them and for whom it is medically safe to prescribe them to - for starters. There's been some promising research on male contraceptives as well (reversible ones, even, which is a nice change from vasectomy), so if those get past FDA approval, I'd have them free as well. Unfortunately, most of these are non-starters: few people support a national curriculum for anything, much less for something as charged as sex ed, and apparently Americans don't favor universal healthcare, much less  free  universal healthcare. Sad thing is, this won't completely end the problem: unplanned pregnancies even happen when people are on birth control or are using condoms, so there might still be abortions. \n 5) Yep. If it's a supreme court decision, it can be overturned. The current court is exceptionally conservative, and not exceptionally deferential to precedent. Since there's been a slew of new abortion laws at the state level recently, I imagine they will have opportunity if they want it. There's some discussion about the politics of the Supreme Court recently (since the ACA ruling) but in my opinion, unless the composition of the court changes, a repeal of RvW is possible. I can't honestly give odds, but it's not zero. \n 6) Not sure, honestly. Writing a law is one thing, and enforcing it is another. If all pregnancies are monitored for termination, for example, then it  will  run up against the legal logic of Roe v. Wade, which will force a SC challenge and a slew of injunctions back and forth. If it's merely a ban on abortions . . . it might go through, with just as many injunctions and back-and-forths and probably a visit to the SC. If it's a ban on birth control and condoms, there will be revolts and possibly a revolution. (I jest, but shit would go down - there's a whole lot of sexually liberated feminists out there who would mobilize against such a law, IMO, even in more conservative states.) \n 7) Honestly, I don't think so. I'm a weak federalist in general, and prefer national (read: general) solutions to policy programs over state (read: specific) solutions in this case in particular, because the issue at hand is largely the same wherever you are in the country. It also creates a shady environment where people can be prosecuted for breaking a law in a state, when the violation occurred in a different state where an abortion was legal (though only in edge cases, like the abortion-tracking personhood amendment above - I'm pretty sure it's not a problem in less restrictive legal environments). Moreover, it's bad policy in general - it imposes exponentially greater costs on the poor and the least powerful in society, because they lack the resources to move to places where laws align with their needs and views. All this said, I'm not a lawyer, so I lack the base of information from which to make a reliably informed opinion. \n 8) OK! The fun part! \n \n Comprehensive Sex Ed. It's science, it's medicine, it's education. It's how we beat smallpox and polio, it's how we can keep kids from getting pregnant before they want to be. It's how we can get non-kids to avoid it, too.^1 Take your  pills, wrap your tool, and have a frank and awkward discussion about sex the next time you go for a checkup. This also goes a good way towards destigmatizing sex, which is a noble goal in itself, in my opinion. \n \n Birth control is a better solution than abortion. I agree with the HHS ruling that it should be paid for without copay by insurance companies, and think that the legal work-around provided to religious employers is both elegant and perfectly acceptable as a compromise. I wish it wasn't necessary, but given that it is, I'll work with it. \n \n No abortion clinics. It singles out women who seek out abortions, and charges the decision. I don't know if this will encourage or deter abortions, but it will remove the mania around the decision - allowing people to make more rational choices. The problem here is that a lot of hospitals are religious, and refuse to perform abortions - as do a lot of doctors. I think this is horse ** , but it is their right as private businesses to do so, even if I disagree. But abortion clinics are dangerous targets for bombings, assaults, and threats - and it adds unnecessary social and psychological stress to a decision that is hard enough as it is. There might have to be some leeway on this, but as a rule I think it's a bad way to go about it. \n \n This isn't really abortion policy per se, but I'd like to see a conception-to-eighteen care system. If women knew that they could give up their children to a system that could take care of them - from their first heartbeat to high school graduation - then I think that fewer people would choose to abort a pregnancy. This would mean  massive  reform of family care law and a slew of other reforms, but I think it's the only policy \"alternative\" to abortion in the case of a desperately unwanted pregnancy. There's also a lot of moral hazard here - after all, that's nine months of free medical care for the mother, and people have done stupider stuff to get health insurance. \n \n \n 9) This is a deeply, deeply charged debate. No matter how rational a solution is, if you disagree with the two poles in our current national debate, you're wrong according to someone. I think that abortion politics will be with us as long as the religious right and feminism are, and I don't see either of them dying soon - and any victory for one could well mean a resurgence of the other in protest.": "rhb",
            "Snow Crash and Diamond Age by Neal Stephenson talk about it some, but it's not the libertarianism that most libertarians are familiar with. It's more a \"freedom to choose your own society and its rules\" than a \"government does not interfere with choices\" liberty. The Common Economic Protocol of SC/DA is technically a government, but the only thing it regulates are the formation of new phyles (societies, etc) and the use of nanorobots for warfare (Nell's foster father, at one point, has to go off to combat against some rebels that violate the terms of the Protocol, IIRC). \n Diamond Age , Japanese engineers, and  the Germans  Hindus, IIRC) are fabulously wealthy for their ability to create new housing zones, commercial areas, and industrial zones more-or-less on demand for the overpopulated cities of China. On the other hand, in the American Southwest you have small (in population) phyles that dominate the landscape: homesteaders whose only duty to the phyle is to mind their own land, and provide for the common defense. There are plenty of other systems described however: a Zulu phyle that protects its own by hunting down and bringing to justice anyone who harms one of theirs, a communist phyle that requires you to give up your possessions and live as if you're in a reeducation camp 24/7, a Hidu phyle that is mostly a bank for anyone who wants to borrow, with collection policies in the form of indentured service, etc, etc. \n It's an excellent character study for societies: you see the good and the bad of every one of them, where they work and they don't, and why. It's all enabled by technology that makes it possible (more or less) to provide everything to the masses at little or no cost, with money being exchanged only for premium design, service, or honest-to-god handmade goods (which are astonishingly expensive - entire phyles live a pastoral existence and create them for wealthier societies - the \"Amish\"/Luddites are billionaires). People do what they want to: become hackers, live in drum circles, homestead, work for Software Kahns, join theatrical troupes, work as scenario writers for a bordello, or in the semi-feudal administrative system of the Middle Kingdom. Most of this is implied, not explicit, which only makes it better reading, if you ask me: Stephenson may hit you over the head with the details of nanotechnology and ponderously describe encryption services (which personally I like anyway), but the wonder and cleverness of how the whole society works is rarely stated directly, meaning you can tease it out slowly and marvel at the way it all fits together.": "printSF",
            "Frankly, Valyrian steel would be expensive, and confers no extra benefits to armor. As a status symbol, there were probably a few hanging around, but they probably didn't make it out after the Doom. \n As for why it'd be bad armor, here're my thoughts: \n 1) Valyrian steel is light. This is great for a weapon, and  terrible  for many kinds of armor. Lighter armor provides less cushioning mass against strong weapon blows, and getting Valyrian steel up the the weight class of normal steel would be difficult without restricting your mobility with the thickness of the armor. You'd be so covered in Valyrian that you couldn't move. As for light armor and chainmail, the amount of minute spell-work and smithy needed to craft it would probably leave the smith profoundly insane. Then, you'd need to redo it/repair it whenever it was seriously damaged. \n 2) Valyrian steel is also supple - if it was too rigid, it would make for a terrible sword. This also makes it  terrible  for armor. Supple and flexible metals require less energy to bend and deform, and they resume their shape when force is removed. This is great for slamming swords around, and not so great for protecting people. When a sword (or warhammer, for that matter) hits armor, much of the protection offered is in the form of blunted momentum. The force of the blow is transferred to the armor - deforming it, but sparing the wearer the trauma of a hammer blow. Valyrian steel would translate that force straight through, and then snap right back into place. In other words, too much of the force would avoid the armor, punching straight through to the wearer. Incidentally, this also means it's a terrible material for mauls, hammers, and other blunt weapons - aside from being less dense, it's as likely to deform as it is to transmit momentum to a target, which is a major no-no. \n 3) Valyrian steel is  expensive . Even before the Doom, it's not like everyone was running around with the stuff. It required master smiths to make, and hours of complex spell-work to craft or reshape. Armor and weapons get damaged, and fixing them requires the same level of skill (though not the time and materials) needed to craft them. But armor takes the cake in terms of damage done and repairs needed. Every serious blow to the armor might require the smith to completely rework as much or more metal as an entire sword, and do so often if the armor is used frequently. This ties up the smith so much that you'd get fewer weapons and armor out of him. We can't know the precised dynamics of how hard it is to smith Valyrian steel unless GRRM tells us, but given his reluctance to give us the guts of his magic systems, I doubt we're going to get and info on the process. We can assume, however, that Valyrian Steel Armor was prohibitively expensive, which means even less of it was made, compared to Valyrian Steel Weapons. If there was ever much, not enough of it survived the Doom or history to make an appearance in Westeros. \n Now, I'm not an armorer, or even a smith, but that's my understanding of the physics (and economics, I guess) of it all.": "asoiaf"

            "First question about revising/re-reading - you work how you work. If you find that doesn't help, you are free to write it all first and then revise later. I only find it helpful when I have hit a wall and need to reconsider what I've got. There is no right or wrong way of working --- everyone is different and everyone works at different speeds. \n Second question: yes, I think that is distracting if you do it too much or for too long at once. Ideally, a character should show the reader what they're doing and why through their interactions with others and engagement with the plot. I do infodump a bit about religion in my current WIP because I have a lot of internal monologue from a priest character, but I'm being a little ruthless in cutting it out at the moment. Basically, have the characters think and act like the reader isn't there. They may have some thoughts that clarify a piece of worldbuilding, but having them talk over things that they'd already know or practice just for the benefit of a reader is a little tedious. When you write a story, show us only what we need to see and tell us only what we need to be told. It's sometimes a little frustrating if you have all that worldbuilding in your head or in your notebooks, but readers pick up context easier through characters acting naturally than through them discussing history and religion at length when they wouldn't otherwise do so.

While you don't want people to speak like they come out of Chaucer or Shakespeare or any deep period piece depending on the historical period you're emulating in your work (for accessibility if nothing else), you also don't want them to speak like 21st century westerners. \n I've experimented with more archaic dialogue in order to create character and atmosphere. I'm writing steampunk fantasy, so I can imitate the speech patterns of the Victorian world without writing totally in that 'dialect'. Like with most things, however, it's getting a balance. Think a little bit more about how to steer a course between total period immersion and just plonking down modern vocabulary in a historically-inspired setting. Period language can be silly to modern ears: I had to suppress a few giggles while reading the memoirs of Titanic survivors, because no-one uses the words they're using seriously any more, yet that was genuinely how people spoke and wrote a hundred years ago, and these were people who fought the sea and won, so they deserved a little bit more of my serious attention than your average Colonel Blimp. Likewise, Lord of the Rings is written in a very archaic style and, despite it being reasonably accessible for a reader, it's not something that I'd advise someone to  copy  nowadays, particularly when Tolkien still uses the word 'queer' for odd and some other words which we've changed the meanings of since then. I write with a modern tone, but use some more archaic words for flavour: 'youths' for 'teenagers', for instance, or 'to be in want of something' for 'needing something'...but only as flavour. \n Maybe try a few good modern translations of older books to get the cadences right (for instance  The Three Musketeers ; a tip is that the free or cheap versions on Amazon are usually reprints of older editions, so you want to look for a recent translation, which may be as expensive as a newly-written book, unfortunately; try Penguin Classics or Oxford University Press editions - they tend to be the most up-to-date versions). I read Emile Zola when I was at school and there was an essay in one of my books explaining how the translator worked to conjure up atmosphere that would be more relatable to a modern audience than translating the archaic French ultra-faithfully without using too much modern slang. Zola's work dealt with working-class politics (and is full of sex and violence, no-holds-barred for its day; it's like Dickens but  better  IMO), so I'd recommend him to any writer of gritty fiction anyway.

There are a lot of people here who game, and a lot of people who write - reasons for world-building which, while not directly antagonistic, are different enough that there's no one-size-fits-all tutorial which could help. For instance, as a writer of fiction, I like bottom-up worldbuilding that can change to fit the story. I don't fix anything until I need to publish something. I like to take a premise and a character, and then grow their society around them, which helped me come up with a kind of Victorian Westeros, albeit with much more pronounced urban fantasy supernatural elements. Other people do conventional mediaeval fantasy, some people do high tech space opera, yet others do post-apocalyptic or alternate history versions of our world, and a lot of people here do write intricate story bibles or wikis to make sure they know their song before they start singing; I'm more of an open-mike, improv night person. \n We all bring different things to the table. Tropes to me reflect what's in the world, rather than being guidelines to work to. ('Tropes are not bad', but they are cliches, and so if someone told me that the way to write a convincing religion was to adopt the tropes of established authors, I'd point out that a lot of modern SF&F is sceptical of faith, and tends to reduce it to a set of inquisitions, petty squabbling gods and corrupt established churches, which as a practising, liberal person of faith I'm keen on  challenging , rather than parroting.) They don't pigeonhole; they create a taxonomy for analysing media, but suggesting they are the be-all and end-all of human (or otherwise) society is probably a restriction too far. \n If you have ideas for a set of tutorials for beginners, though, shoot. I've written up a tutorial for producing artistic city maps on another forum, and might copy it over here (because I can't link directly to a members-only section of another site). There's a bank holiday coming up in the UK :), and it might be wet.": "worldbuilding",
            "Tricky one. I don't think it's either/or. I've done this a few times with various stories - not so much worldbuilding details, more with the way the story pans out. Since I'm a gardener rather than an architect, I usually start the story with a premise and a scene and not much else. While I was writing my last novella, I had a brainwave halfway through about the status of one of the protagonists that really shook things up. I actually didn't stop writing, because I still had the basics of the story down and the plot didn't change. I just went back and tweaked bits and pieces at the beginning of the book to give some hints to what was going to be revealed later on, some before I finished the book and some afterwards, when I'd worked on another story with a similar character in it and knew the general mechanics of how that variety of supernatural character worked. \n So maybe see what you can salvage from the first part of the story. Does it change the fundamental premise of the scenes you've already written, or does it require you to scrap what you've got? I'm also part way through a book where I had a few doubts about what had happened to awaken the monster threatening a ship, plus I've worked out that there's an internal political issue surrounding the protagonist that needs some trailing. I've kept as much as possible of what I already had, and rewritten some parts of it to reflect the altered mechanics. When I rewrite, I find that the structure of the book doesn't change an awful lot - it's the content that does change. So therefore there's an incentive to keep the skeleton and change the flesh. \n This can happen at any time, but usually with me it's how the story develops later on that changes things at the beginning, and I additionally find it helpful to revise what I've already got, quite often in order to regain momentum after taking a break (which I do regularly to keep myself from burning out on a particular work). During re-reads, I continually tweak and add and subtract; I've tried just loading the book onto Kindle to avoid that, but ended up making loads of notes in the text and thought I'd be better just to read it in Scrivener so I could make the tweaks I wanted to make at the time and have done with it. I wouldn't presume to tell you how you work best, because everyone finds their own way of working which suits them. \n Does that help?": "fantasywriters",
            "I must admit I didn't enjoy the last time I tried to do a Camp NaNoWriMo challenge in July 2014, because I got to the 'so near, yet so far' point - within 10% of the total - and then couldn't look at what I'd written as a result of having personal issues take over in the final few days and letting things slide completely. So this year I'm doing something in the spirit of NaNoWriMo, but without the numbers game that was actually detrimental to my enjoyment of writing (and let's face it if it's not enjoyable, there's no point in doing it). \n Basically, I'm trying to do a scene a day on a rewrite of the MS from last year. No pressure, no word count, it's a revision so I'm editing as well as pouring out words - I am working on structure and composition as well as sheer volume. I had a few issues earlier in the autumn which prevented me from finishing the project I've been working on for most of the year, but once my head was in a better place, I've bounced back. I know I don't do well with numbers, but because the issue with the first draft of this book was the structure and plotting, my goal at the end of November is to have a viable project, maybe not finished but with the back broken and a general idea of how all the plot points tie together. I've already figured out some of the elements that were plaguing the original draft. I did start on 23 October, and I'm 10K words in, but as I said, the point is not word count, the point is moulding the story into much better shape than it was in previously.": "writing",
            "It's hard to critique this because I'm not sure where you're going with it. It's a nice piece of writing, and it's fluent and immersive, but I think there's certain elements of it which are very situational, and if it's OK to show me a little more - the beginning of the actual plot - it might help to give you a more concrete critique, because at the moment I'm just guessing as to the intentions of the story. \n My first question is, basically, how long the story is going to be. In general, with a  short  short story, I'd go in both feet first, which means any exposition should be kept to a minimum. Writing a 2K word story recently which did have a lot of background to get across, I started the dialogue/action going and fed in most of the context when the characters were getting to the point where the reader needed that perspective. Without much context as to the later thrust of the story, I'm assuming however that you need to give me information about the city watch. I'd just watch the character's perspective getting too lavish in description of the world around her while not yet putting her directly into the situation that forms the backbone of the story. \n >The new city watch\u2019s so-called justice was as brutal as it was corrupt. Loved ones would disappear at night, only to be found face first in the filth filled gutter, with bruised bodies and open throats. Those who went to the new government with tales of abuse and molestation were turned away, their pleas idly disregarded below flamboyant feasts and other hollow luxuries. Fear hung in the air like a stagnant mist, stifling and inescapable. \n This basically sounds as if you're setting up a mystery.  However , in a short comic book story I wrote, I was told that exposition like this (the protag of the story was narrating it in the past tense, which is why I generally gave up on comics and went into prose) dampened the emotional impact of seeing such an incident (my cousin studied screenwriting at UCLA, so he was a good person to go for for critique on drama; comic books are basically frozen TV episodes :D). If this is a fundamental point of the story, show us it, don't tell us. \n In fact, although it was a chilling, Soviet-style dictatorship style disappearance rather than brutalised bodies appearing on the street, this is almost idential a passage my cousin told me broke impact later on when we saw an example of such punishment. It would be more shocking to us if you showed something like this happening - but as it's a short story, what you tell us also has to revolve around what the vignette is about. So while this might set the scene nicely for a longer novel in which such action was peripheral, for a short story, it potentially punctures tensions I assume you're going to explore. If you're just using this as atmos and the story is about something totally different, then it might be relevant, but I'd go for something more directly relevant to what situation you are setting up and resolving. (China Mieville uses such an idea of a violent state leaving warnings to its citizens on the street in  Perdido Street Station  without it being a particular plot point, but his novel was huge and could comfortably go into world-building detail without detracting from the focus of the story.)": "fantasywriters"

Nothing unusual, but my mother would take me when she needed to do some shopping, my grandmother would take me to see movies, my dad would take me when he needed to go to Sears, etc. When driving to the mall, I never had the experience of going past the turn-in, simply because my parents never had reason to go that way when I was in the car. \n Right past the mall was a construction company owned by a guy named Foxworth, including a sign with a big picture of a fox. So the four year old me, not being able to read, concluded that we never went past this point because, past that sign, was the Land of the Foxes. Humans weren't allowed there - I thought that the people I saw driving down there were really brave, and the ones coming back were very lucky. \n I never told anyone about this, so no one ever told me I was silly. And then, one day, my mother had to get her drivers license renewed at the DMV, which was ... past the mall. \n I get in the car quite content. We're heading towards the mall, it's all familiar, no worries. And then we get to the mall, and we keep driving. I distinctly remember the growing knot in my stomach as I realized that my mother was going into the Land of the Foxes. My mind raced. Why was Mom doing this? Was she going to kill me???? That must be it! She's going to give me to the foxes!!! What did I do?!?!?! WHY WOULD SHE DO THIS?!?!?!?!?!?! \n At this point I began shrieking and thrashing.

            "Engineer mode activated! > \n Thermodynamically speaking, this is precisely what is happening when a sympathist uses their body heat as a source. Complex organic molecules like those found in food store a lot of energy. Our digestive system is designed to convert those big, complex molecules into a form that our cells can burn for fuel, and the resulting release in energy is where our body heat comes from. \n So how would this be applied to sympathy? \n Well, I can see several possibilities. First there's the one we already know: letting the body convert the energy in food to heat, and using that. A well established method. \n Anything else is beyond what we have seen sympathists be capable of using. The bloodstream transports simple sugars (from food, via the digestive system, or from stored fat) to the cells, which are then converted to cellular fuel. The energy in these simple sugars is locked up in the chemical bonds that link atom to atom and form the molecule. While these contain a hell of a lot of energy, using them would mean, essentially, burning the molecule. \n So, if a sympathist were able to do this, they would be setting off a pretty powerful chemical reaction within their bloodstream. Unless they were very, VERY careful, it would probably lead to something I am christening \"binder's fever,\" and would probably kill them. \n Now, if you really wanted to be clever, you would think, \"aren't chemical bonds pretty much the same everywhere?\" And you are correct, clever student! Suppose a sympathist learned to break down chemical bonds directly, and use this as a source, rather than starting an independent chemical reaction (such as a fire) and using the released heat as a source. Doing so would be the sympathy equivalent of rocket fuel. If a sympathist was able to use chemical energy directly, than EVERYTHING would be an immediately accessible and handy source. A block of wood contains all the heat given off by burning it, plus a lot more. If a sympathist were able to access energy in this way, they could carry around a bonfire in their pocket. Hell, you could strip them naked, shave their heads, starve them, and shove them in a dungeon, and they would be able to  use the walls of the dungeon for fuel.  And when they were done, as a bonus, the section of the wall they used would be reduced to silicon dust, and they could just stroll right out.": "Fantasy",
            "About the Many Worlds and the Dark One: In the chapter way back in tDR, when Verin gave Egwene the dream ter'angreal, they had a conversation about this. According to Verin (whom I believe on this, despite the fact that I will always think of her as Sneaky Verin), if the Dark One breaks free in one world, he breaks free in all worlds, but if he is held bound in one world, he is held bound in all. Verin says flat-out that it's a paradox, but it's the way it is nevertheless. \n Ishamael-Moridin, who was a philosopher in the AoL, actually turned to the Shadow after coming to the conclusion that the DO's victory is inevitable, though for a different reason. His reasoning was that each time the Light wins, the Dark is simply walled away, and the status quo continues. If the Dark wins, the Pattern is destroyed, and victory is permanent. So the Light could win 10,000 victories in a row, but if the Dark wins once, game over. \n Regarding toh: in some cases, there are specific acts that incur toh, and the obligation to meet that toh is clearly defined. The most obvious is being captured in battle: you have toh towards the one who captured you, and that toh is met by serving as gai'shain for a year and a day. In other instances, there are two sides to it. \n In Egwene's case, she lied to a bunch of people, thus incurring toh. Her chosen method of meeting that toh was allowing those she lied to to beat her. She could have halted the beatings at any time, and declared her toh to be met. One of the Wise One's says something like, \"only you know the depth of your honor,\" so if she had stopped it after one hit, that would have indicated that her honor wasn't much to speak of. In contrast, when Sulin was meeting toh by being a wetlander servant, most people seemed to consider it excessive, and a kind of boasting. In other words, the more you are willing to endure to meet toh, the greater honor you have. \n All that being said, the person on the other end of it can say there is no obligation. If they agree that there is an obligation, they have no say in how it is to be met (unless the person who incurred the toh gives them the choice).

            "I agree with most of it, and applaud you for putting this together, but I will offer a differing opinion on adverbs. \n Adverbs encourage quickness, brevity, and an easy understanding of your writing; and as much as you want to challenge and engross the reader with your prose, your primary goal as a storyteller is to ensure you don't lose them, and get it as close to a direct and seamless telepathic transmission of your story as possible. \n By using adverbs, you can place emphasis where you want it; if you want to create a sense of background action, you use adverbs for unimportant characters, and employ greater detail for your main characters, or for specific actions within the greater scene. \n It's like painting. Where is the focus? What is the object of the scene? Does the detail add or detract? Almost always, you can benefit from adding detail, but remember that you're telling a story; if you're offering an in-depth description of every single fruit in a bazaar at the expense of the thrilling escape from the guards in the background, you may need to reconsider your perspective. \n (Alternately, this could be the makings of a funny short story.) \n Ideally, what you want is to achieve a balance in using them - not to eliminate them completely. Adverbs get a bad rep because of their overuse by poor writers, who haven't properly developed their faculties with descriptive language, and as a result, rely completely on the adverb to communicate their vision to you. That results in the problem you're addressing above.": "fantasywriters",
            "How? Symbolism, your character's choices, your writing choices, and possibly a particular framework informing your point of view. \n Case in point - symbolism is an easy way to infuse your story with meaning beyond what's happening. Maybe you decide that certain things carry meaning; ex. in John Woo's movies, he decided birds symbolize danger. Maybe, in your work, you want to show nature as a safe place, and code it as such with more comforting descriptive language, show it as an escape for your character, etc. Or, better still, imbue symbolism in your character - as in Hunger Games, where Katniss Everdeen becomes The Girl Who Was on Fire. That \"Fire\" ignites a revolution. Fire & heat are the elemental opposites of water, ice, and snow. Hence, it's no surprise that the Girl Who Was on Fire is the one who evaporates President Snow's reign. \n The choices you make in your writing and that your characters make also inform this; they can be, as mentioned, in line with Judeo-Christian mythos (resurrection / sacrifice), or they can be representative of a particular school of thought (i.e. my fantasy novel may be seen as more feminist than others, due to a high prevalence of female characters, more attention to their roles in manipulating the power struggle for control of the kingdom, and attempts to achieve or be seen having parity with their male counterparts, in addition to working with common goals in mind, and a severe lack of damseling. This is deliberate.) \n Sometimes you make a conscious effort to work deeper meaning in - for example, Atlas Shrugged by Ayn Rand or Albert Camus' The Stranger. Sometimes it emerges organically. Sometimes, your story starts as a means to explore a topic; I have a YA fantasy story I'm working on that's an exploration of religion and sin. It's loaded with symbolism by virtue of the topics it's dealing with, but I've seen fit to expand past them and include other elements as well. \n If you have other questions, definitely ask your English teachers. They did a ton of literary criticism for their degrees, and I'm certain they'll point you in the right directions for learning the finer points of things. And as much as I hate suggesting Joseph Campbell's monomyth through \"The Hero With A Thousand Faces\" (because, for me, knowing the monomyth when I started felt tantamount to cheating. Don't ask why, I'm weird like that.), I would suggest exactly that as a good place to start. \n Also, try any of Roland Barthes' work, in addition to Emile Zola. Barthes was big on literary criticism and interpretation of symbols, but he also got into signs and semiotics (the language of symbolic communication in our culture), and it's an easy read.": "fantasywriters",

            "This post was prompted by a thread [over here]( wherein /u/eaturbrainz noted something which has been nagging me for a while -- and I mean a  while  -- I've been ruminating on this since before /r/rational existed, which is why it took so long to write this. This pertains mostly to rational and rationalist  fan fiction, but I hope everyone can get something out of it. \n \n Eliezer Yudkowsky touched on something important in his [Explaining Other Universes]( post, but I want to take it further. \n > There's something that feels natural about exploiting laws and explaining facts someone else laid down, maybe because it bears a resemblance to the real challenge we face against Nature. \n > One way to get that feeling is the path of hard SF and hard fantasy: to have a small set of premises so lawful that by the time they turn into problems and puzzles, you don't feel like you're choosing them, because they were generated by the law. \n > But that path is hard, and doesn't work for everything. There are simple laws that you can decide will govern time-travel and then everything else will follow from that; but there is no simple law that generates Dementors, or Azkaban, or the Potters' tombstone. \n > So the other way is to write stories inside someone else's universe, and stare at that universe's given observations until you begin to imagine your own answers to its puzzles, and deduce what further facts you require as background truths. \n > Hence rationalist fanfiction. \n Fanfiction, as a rule, is an incredibly diverse medium. Crackfics and straight retellings of canon abound, but rationalfics are unique in that they have an implied requirement to improve on the source material. The rational fanfiction (ratfic?) writer looks at the source material and says to themselves \"I like this, but I would like it more if it was more like  this .\" \n Which brings us to the discussion: \n > [/u/eaturbrainz] eh-hem. Real-world heuristics for instrumental rationality are not  actually  instrumental rationality. If you find yourself in a universe with Spiral Power, going beyond the impossible and kicking logic to the curb  is the strictly rational move . You cannot rationalfic Gurren Lagann because there are no errors in reasoning to fix, whatsoever: they're doing the right things the whole time because  their universe really does run on awesomesauce . \n It's not just  Gurren Lagann  which falls victim to this;  Fullmetal Alchemist  ( Brotherhood  or the original manga, not the first anime run) is mis-re-interpeted on this subreddit too. I can see why it makes an attractive candidate: it has a great plot with many twists and characters and some cool, albeit limited, use of real chemistry.  But if you try to make  Fullmetal Alchemist  more rational by injecting more complex chemistry into the fight scenes, you have totally missed the point. \n Fullmetal Alchemist  is not about solving problems through the power of  family  molecular bonds.  Fullmetal Alchemist  is about  grief . It is about  redemption . The most significant plot devices such as Philosopher's Stones or Human Transmutation have jack-all to do with real-world physics. \n A fictional work can be divided into two parts: the  plot  and the  story . The plot is the actual sequence of events. The story is the emotional foundation running in parallel. Together they form the narrative. Good writers recognize this, and keep these two parts properly synchronized. Think of your favorite story, like, say,  Worm . When you're remembering your favorite part, you're really remembering the  story , not the  plot . You have to think harder and further past the general happiness to realize why it makes you have such a fond recollection. This is why a work of literature can endure for centuries even though precious little actually occurs in the book, and why the most explosive action film can be forgotten a few hours after you leave the theater. \n This is why adding more chemistry to  Fullmetal Alchemist  is such a grave mistake: the plot gains little, and the story even less. If you want to write a rational fanfiction, you have to understand the Real Issues at the heart of the original, and work from there. \n Quick question: How much has Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres learned about magic since the start of HPMOR?  Not that much . There's one quick theorycrafting session about Atlantis and sufficiently advanced technology and that's all. It's still a fantastic story of course,  because the magic doesn't actually matter . Unlike  Ra , HPMOR does not trip over its own magic system. A \"plausible\" hypothesis is tossed to the audience like a bone and Eliezer gets on with the actual plot, confronting the  Actual Problem . \n That  is what rational fiction is about (to me anyway). Looking past Good and Evil and saying: What is the Real Problem here? What,  when you get down to it , is causing all of this trouble? \n Writing a rational fanfiction is writing the N+1 draft of that work. You have the entirety of the source material laid out in front of you all at once, an advantage the original author could only dream of.

            "Older sister and mother were doing cool things with words as long as I can remember, and being homeschooled early on gave me tons of free time to develop my imagination. \n My younger brother and I would make up these enournmous role-play games with original characters, worlds, baddies, plots, and so forth, making it up as we went along for  months  on end until we started a new one. \n I was extremely interested in videogames during this period, and keep in mind that I was 9 or 12 through this next bit: I would fill notebook after notebook with game designs, down to the smalest unit for strategy games or plot notes for rpg's. Even at that age, I was worried about things like deep tactics, getting the player emotionally invested in the story, rewarding gameplay, and even precautions against copyright infringement. Since I hadn't learned programming yet, I prototyped these in the Map Editors of StarCraft and Age of Empires, using their internal scripting engines to achieve wonders (or that's what it felt like anyway). \n It was around this time I played  Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess  and then I decided I wanted to do this for a living. If you've played the game, you know that it is a masterpiece of design and cohesion between art, story, mechanics, and anything else. I loved the darker atmosphere, the mix of awe and dread you feel while exploring, everything. The most important note here is that after I beat the game I stumbled into the online fandom, and that's where things got interesting. \n People often say fanfiction is a pile of shit, and they're kinda right. But there's enough of it out there that some truly incredible writers create things that blow your mind. LoZ fanfiction is pretty diverse, but more importantly it's a bunch of unpaid ametuers. \n People also say to study the greats, and they are kinda right there, too. But you must not miss the writers of your level, the ones surrounding you, because it's in that zone of peers you learn fastest. I was pretty solid on the basics (my mom had a small library of books about writing, and I had read a lot of these already) so I was somewhat ahead of the curve. One of my favorite lessons from fanfiction is that building a deep universe into your fiction is one of the coolest things you can do, and you know you've done something well when thousands fans are creating their own content because the original  was just too good, there wasn't enough . \n Whew, not sure where the lecture came from. Anyway my personal development as a writer is centered in the core of the internet as a ludicrously free-form enviornment of expression and learning.

            "Hello, ladies and gentlemen. This post is intended to be both a resource and a guide, keeping everyone on the same page. It is not the final say, and can be edited and amended for whatever reasons necessary. \n I'll use my own characters for the examples: \n > Aethaniel: Hello! \n > Kelly: Go away. \n Let's break this down. \n The Basics \n The only real rule of /r/FictionBrawl is the Ask Rule, which is (more or less) as follows:  The attacker must \"ask permission\" for a hit to connect, leaving it up to the defender to accept the hit and describe the severity of its impact. Don't do this: \n > Myself1: Kelly grabbed Aethaniel's wrist and hacked at it, severing his hand. \n Do this: \n > Myself1: Kelly hacked at Aethaniel's hand. \n > Myself2: \"Aaugh!\" Aethaniel cried as the blade severed a finger. \n (There's a certain story of  Aethaniel and the Dragon , if you need any more examples...) \n This rule is  not  an excuse to never take a hit. This sub lives and dies on the Duels, and the Duels depend on good sportsmanship, so play nice and eviscerate each other. Understand this and you're halfway to infinity. \n \n Formatting \n The only stipulation on format is to stay consistent within the duel. If the first post was written in past tense, for the love of mercy don't switch to present-tense halfway through (I don't know why anyone would ever use present-tense at all, but that's a different discussion). \n I've also seen people use italics for the entirety of their posts. I'm not putting the practice down, but I will assert that it's totally not a requirement. \n What I've  never  seen is a duel written in 1st-person. It should work in theory, but apparently no one's ever tried it. Something to experiment with, I think. \n \n Choosing Characters \n We all have a variety of characters to pluck from their various home universes and commit to deadly combat, but exactly which ones should be used where is tricky. When you describe them, include any information that could be relevant in a fight, including past versions if you have used them before. If they've made an AMA on /r/IAMAFiction, link to it. \n There's no formal limit on reuse of a character, but you should only ever make an actual self-post once per duelist. Being the original poster also gives you control over the setting, which I will talk about later. It is also important to consider who you are facing. While you may be tempted to pick characters to counter the OP,  the point of the sub is to fight a good fight, and NOT to win.  However, sometimes it is beneficial to the OP to be forced to brainstorm ways to deal with an outmatched opponent, so as in all things, discretion is advised. \n /r/FictionBrawl has a recurring and equally frustrating and hilarious problem of two combatants befriending each other instead of fighting.  Whether they're both Hero-class, or just averse to fighting, it is sometimes necessary to make up excuses to get them going again, so keep that in mind when starting a duel. \n \n Invoking the Environment \n A good fighter uses his enviornment to its fullest potential, and a good battlefield has lots of potential to use. \n > Aethaniel glanced around the expansive throne room as the servants made preparations for the feast. The servants were getting in the guard's way and vice-versa as they carried in long oaken tables. Overhead the gaslights mixed with the sunset flooding through the incredible stained glass windows. The castle was built on a promontory, and this room came right up to the cliff's edge, just for the view. The huge purple drapes, as big as sails, were restrained by chains, and decorative suits of armor with full weapons eternally guarded the carved marble pillars. It was a tactical nightmare. \n Is it really? Analysis Time! It's a big ol' throne room, so there's plenty of hard and sturdy floor space. However, at the current moment it's full of people carrying large objects everywhere. As you write your fight scenes, try to include as much of the scene as you can, even if it's only for style. In this scene, we also have vast windows on a cliff (good for throwing people out), drapes (lots of uses there if you pull them down), pillars (minor obstructions) that are carved (enabling agile characters to climb them), and suits of armor (sources of weapons and, well, armor), servants (innocent bystanders) and guards (aggressive bystanders). \n Seems like fertile ground to me. This is just an example; don't feel pressured to use complicated scenes, but don't be afraid of them either. \n \n Powers & Equipment \n It's always nice to list everything upfront about each character's capabilities.  If you forget something on accident, it isn't there, so don't pull it out later. It's ok to lose. \n High amounts of endurance get tedious pretty fast (ex. The entirety of Dragon Ball Z, etc.). If a character gets punched through a wall, he should feel it, and still be feeling it for the rest of the fight. And if he's so strong that he wouldn't feel it, then get hit with something that would leave a mark. A \"Flawless Victory\" is the exact opposite of /r/FictionBrawl. \n Remember to be precise and accurate in your scaling. If I say that Kelly is an ordinary human with some  extraordinary  shooting skills, and she gets punched through a wall, she's dead, 'cause that's what happens when you get punched through a wall. You can excuse it with something like \"She's stronger than average\" or other nonsense, but you have to at least have an excuse. \n Regarding the powers themselves, pretty much anything goes. I've even seen varieties of precognition that treat the character as if they can read Out-Of-Character posts, etc. Limit Breaks, Power Levels, Gates, and so forth are all valid attributes of a character, if a little boring ( the situation has changed, I'll flip a switch and become even stronger! AAAAAGGHHHH ) \n \n Fight Economics \n A good fight usually has some degree of back-and-forth. There's no health bar here, but the \"ability of each fighter to continue fighting\" should not be static.  The combatants should ESCALATE instead of STAGNATE as their usual moves are spent. \n It's also good to take hits for another reason. Everyone wants to be the coolest guy that destroys everybody's stuff, but they can only do so at the expense of other people.  You're more likely to get those moments of awesome if you let the other guys do the same thing. \n Another important concept is that of ammunition. Finite resources are an excellent way to ramp up the tension by the simple virtue of their expenditure. The hero immediately becomes more desperate when he runs out of bullets, and even a mage can exhaust himself.  Endurance is actually a negative trait for writing fight scenes, since such battles turn into wars of attrition as they slowly erode each others' power reserves. \n The point isn't to limit the character for the sake of limiting them, but to introduce as many different problems as possible for them to solve in spectacular fashion. \n Lastly, try to wrap things up in a timely manner. A fight that goes on past 200 posts is definitely taking too long and would be better served as multiple, distinct battles. Users are free to declare a \"time-limit\" of whatever thread length they desire. And don't wait too long before responding (at least leave an OOC comment if you're going camping or something). \n \n Writing for Clarity \n This is important. Always use proper spelling, punctuation, and grammar, and proofread your posts before and after posting to be sure there are no mistakes. If an action is ambiguous, make it not so. Don't rush your posts and make silly mistakes, even if you do get a bit excited. \n > Aethaniel readied his sword as Kelly came up by his side. He turned around quickly to face her. \n > \"What the heck is going on?!\" he said. \n > Kelly shrugged. \"Dunno.\" \n Did you catch that? With the way the above passage is written, Aethaniel should have cut Kelly as he whirled about. Keep an eye out for tricky situations like this, and at least add a line explaining it. \n > Aethaniel readied his sword as Kelly came up by his side. He turned around quickly to face her, the tip of his blade halting just above her throat. \n > \"What the heck is going on?!\" he said. \n > Kelly shrugged. \"Dunno.\" \n That's better.": "FictionBrawl",
            "More context would be appreciated, but I had a similar problem recently, so I'll explain how I solved that. \n My issue was arranging a decent chain of events that brings together six individuals from totally different backgrounds as quickly as possible. Making this happen while also setting up for the main arcs was getting ridiculous as many different justifications and other bullshit was getting in the way of telling a good story. \n It was then I realized that the probelm was exactly that, ridiculous.  I had allowed the work to become over-complicated.  So instead of adding on other layers of motivations and backstories to force everything to connect, I started pulling them away, stripped down and simplified the backstories and finally condensed the location spread from three to one. \n Your motivation is already there, it's just obscured.  I really, really need more context for a helpful suggestion, but I can say that character motivations are best when they affect other characters. In my case, having the focus on a core team of six creates some fascinating group dynamics, and since their objectives sort of line up but not quite there is conflict as well. \n Essentially, your character may be lacking proper motivations because he is lonely.  There are not enough other characters compelling him in different directions while maintaining their own goals.": "Screenwriting"

            "Recently I've been on a bit of a nostalgia kick and I ended up re-watching Beast Wars. Naturally, this brought me back to Beast Machines as well. I'm almost done re-watching the first season, but I vaguely remember how the series ends. \n Anyway, I don't know if any of you have read this Star Wars fan theory, but many fans have this idea that the Emperor was building up the clone army and the death star and whatnot in order to fight off a massive invasion force from another galaxy (something he'd foreseen because of the force or whatever). That got me thinking. \n Originally, Cybertron was Primus, and not an actual organic planet. Beast Machines made it seem like it was an organic planet that had life similar to Earth (plants and animals, with Nightscream's bat form being the notable example). Well, what if Cybertron was still Primus? \n What if Primus saw what had happened to Optimus and the Maximals on Earth during the Beast Wars and had seen how powerful their beast forms were? And he already had a direct link to Optimus since Optimus had held the Matrix within him during the Beast Wars while trying to stop Megatron from destroying the Ark? \n Throughout Beast Machines, it is shown that the Matrix/Allspark/Oracle (aka Primus) is capable of giving the characters elaborate hallucinations/\"visions.\" Maybe there was never any organic side to Cybertron, just the visions given to Optimus and the other Maximals. Maybe Nightscream himself was a hallucination or an early experiment by Primus into creating organic life (his only source for inspiration being Earth animals). \n The point being, Primus wanted Cybertron to become Technorganic, the perfect fusion of nature and machine. But why? Because it was stronger. And why would Primus want to be stronger? Why would he want Cybertron and all the Maximals and Predacons to be stronger? \n To face the only real threat against Cybertron and Primus alike: the return of  Unicron.": "FanTheories",

            "I was once alone in my apartment and I was feeling really sick. So I decided to go to the store to pick up some medicine.

I could tell you that time heals all wounds. But, the fact is, time won't heal those wounds.

            "Let me tell you a story (and I really hope this helps). Keep in mind, right now I'm a bit drunk. \n I once dated a girl for a few months. And I fell in love with that girl. It was the first time I'd ever been in love so it was a feeling that filled me up totally and completely and I'd never known something could be that amazing. Well, she dumped me. And not in a creative way. I'm a writer so I greatly prize creativity and her lack thereof really hurt me. She used a variation on the \"it's not you, it's me\" speech. \n I spent nearly the same amount of time I'd been in the relationship with her, getting over her. The whole time, I felt like a loser. I felt inadequate. Like I wasn't worthy of her love. I tried to use all the things I'd learned from TV shows and movies and very sad songs to get over her. But nothing worked. I was so mad. I mean, I'd cared so deeply for her but she just managed to shut those feelings off in herself and I began to wonder if she'd ever felt the way I'd felt. I began to think that she might've been lying the whole relationship. \n And so I started to think of all the possible reasons that she would do that. All the possible reasons that things wouldn't have worked out between us. I made a list. And my oh-so-sad realization was that the reason wasn't just one thing. It was all the things I'd listed. She wasn't right for me and I wasn't right for her and as much as I missed her, I would never be able to trust her again after that because of how she'd hurt me. And that made me even angrier. You know that feeling when you hate someone for not loving you and that makes you hate yourself even more? I don't know if there's a word for that. The English language seems so lacking when it comes to words with such complex emotions. Maybe the eskimos have a word for it. \n Anyway, I thought long and hard about what to do. I mean, she'd been my best friend, too. So it was like losing two of the most important people in my life at the exact same time. And when I was around my other friends, it was like I'd been gone for a really long time, only I didn't have anything to add to their conversations. I didn't have any new stories to tell. I'd become boring. It was like I hadn't existed for all those months. \n So I hated myself. Until I realized something very important. I had to move on. That was it. There was no other option. I'd wallowed in self pity too long. If I didn't have new stories to tell, I'd go do some new things. I'd make new friends. I'd reconnect with my family. I'd do crazy things. I'd talk to people and say things I never would've said otherwise. I'd become interesting again. \n And after a little while, something amazing happened: I was back to normal. No, scratch that, I was better than normal. I was me again but stronger. Someone had hurt me worse than I'd ever been hurt before? That meant nothing could hurt as bad. And suddenly that meant I wasn't afraid of all the stupid little things I'd been afraid of before. I was brave. And exciting. \n Months went by and I saw my ex. And she had gained at least five pounds. Now, I'll be honest, I like curves. I really do. But there's something so damn satisfying about seeing an ex get fat.

Firstly, the Cultural revolution was less about culture and more about politics, what it really was was a few layers of marxist and maoist rhetoric on top of a cynical, naked political purge. \n Also, you cannot deny that there is a general pattern in chinese history which is not seen in Europe: every few centuries, china falls apart and has a period of turmoil, civil war, strife, or invasion.  Then it pulls itself together and goes on for a century or two in peace and prosperity before tearing itself apart again.  This pattern has repeated numerous times, and each time china has re unified in some shape or form. \n This did not happen with Europe.  The roman empire fell apart and after that, never did Europe reunite under one rule again.  But when the Han dynasty fell apart, that was NOT the end of china as a unified state, and it is interesting to wonder why. \n I do agree that it's not that meaningful to talk about the \"idea\" of unity.

However, the fact of actual political unity in china being more the rule than the exception cannot be denied. \n Lastly, I take issue with how you dismissed offhand without the slightest argumentation several reasonable hypothesis by simply demeaning them as \"just so stories\".  It's not a \"just so\" story if you're making a very sincere effort to try to unravel some threads in a tree of causation. \n To argue briefly for geography being a major factor, consider that the core of China is relatively compact, while Europe has more peninsulas and internal mountains.  Also consider the fact that China is sort of isolated from other major civilizations, which allows one strong faction the time to take over the others, while Europe always has to content with influences from the middle east.  This is not meant to be a fool proof argument, firstly because a historical argument isn't meant to be air tight, secondly because I don't have much time and I'm trying to be brief. \n To argue briefly that the writing system and language is somewhat of a factor, consider the language of Japanese which linguistically has absolutely nothing to do with chinese, but stole the chinese writing system as it's own.  I can read a rudimentary level of chinese and I have never spoke or studied japanese.  However, even with that low skill, I can somewhat understand a few snatches from a document written in Japanese Kanji.  This is simply because Kanji IS chinese characters, the Japanese way back long ago took the chinese writing system and adopted the characters semantically.  So Japanese pronounces the chinese character however it is said in japanese, but it means the same thing as it does chinese.  For example consider the word \u65e5\u672c.  In japanese, I understand that it is pronounced \"nippon\".  In mandarin, it is pronounced \"ri4 ben3\".  In both languages, it means [literally] \"origin of the sun\".  The point is, all the chinese dialects/languages share the same character system, just as chinese shares it with japanese.  This means that translating documents roughly isn't that difficult, even if you only know the other language on a low rudimentary level, even if you can't actually speak it.  Wheras, english and german use the same alphabetical script but if you're going to translate, you'd better be pretty good at both languages.  I'd say this whole deal makes somewhat of a difference. \n To argue briefly that the religions are somewhat of a factor, seriously have you ever heard of a religious war where both sides are non-abrahamic?  Like, between Bhuddists and hindus [where both sides are explicitly fighting for religion, not just that the two sides happen to be bhuddist and hindu]?  Or daoists and bhuddists?  Or Jupiter worshipers and Thor worshipers?  As I said, sure they fought, but they weren't fighting because the other guy wouldn't accept one's own religion.  The point is, non abrahamic religions cause a lot less friction, and it makes politics just a tad less complicated.  Once christianity got into the mix in europe, what with the western church versus the eastern church, and then the protestants versus the catholics, and crusades against heretics taking up people's energies, yeah it gets complicated. \n To end off, I'll say that 1) Generalizations are not bad generalizations just because it isn't 100% true in every single case, and 2) no one here is trying to say that it's really simple and without nuance, most every response I've read is trying to do justice to complexity while sticking to a point.": "AskHistorians",
            "since we're doing literary analysis, might as well break out some counter-criticism right? \n >The reasons for this coding system (whether it\u2019s intentional or not) seem obvious\u2014doggy-style sex is, visually, all about power\u2014one figure (male) \u201ctaking\u201d another (female). Several excellent articles have talked about how Game of Thrones manages all sex as an expression of power on behalf of the female characters, but the immediate visual cue is one of no intimacy, love, or pleasure for the receiving partner. \n >The code is clear: doggy-style is rape-y, domineering, sexist. But the purity of face-to-face sex is so great that it can turn a brutish rapist into a loving husband. Babies are born from gazing into each other\u2019s eyes. \n the above quotes seem to be the thesis of the article.  the author is exploring the usage of the trope \"doggystyle/blowjob implies dispassionate dominance by the male partner\" in game of thrones, establishing that the trope is usually played straight throughout game of thrones.  she also seems to be refuting the idea that \"Game of Thrones manages all sex as an expression of power on behalf of the female characters\", insisting that the truth is actually usually more to the contrary, but with some important exceptions critical to plot and character development. \n if the trope is played straight, which is indeed the usual case in game of thrones, the male partner is dominant and gives the impression of \"using the girl for just sex\".  the code for this is doggy style sex, and fallatio.  but sometimes, every once in a while, you've got loving, intimate sex and the code for that is face-to-face sex of various sorts.  in the second you can argue that the trope is still played straight since it's just a contrapositive of the original formulation.  (for those of you who don't know what I'm talking about, what I'm saying is that \"NOT doggystyle/blowjob implies NOT dispassionate dominance by the male partner\" is logically equivalent to \"doggystyle/blowjob implies dispassionate dominance by the male partner\".  take a course in formal logic muthafuckas) \n the basic thesis i can agree with, but lots of the evidence the author uses is flawed.  for example, as someone else pointed out, the scene between jamie and cersei is much more complicated than \"jamie is a beast, he likes transgressive sex, fucks his sister from behind, and pushes kids out of windows with no qualms\".  this is definitely the impression that is given, no doubt about that.  but if you've read the books, you'll learn there's so much more to jamie's character, and make no mistake there IS intimacy between them at that point in time, it was not a dispassionate affair from jamie's end.  so this is an instance where the trope is kind of played with and then neutralized.  now that i think of it, i think it's done pretty well.  big props to the writers for literary skill in this scene (although, as someone pointed out, the decision to make the sex be doggy style was probably more due to practical considerations.  but if so, then it worked out just right) \n also, consider the following quote: \n >Doggy style seems to be part of a larger sexual coding in this universe. Transgressive sex\u2014an extremely wide category in this case that includes sex with prostitutes, sibling incest, rape, pseudo-lesbian sex lessons\u2014happens in the form of doggy style. \n again, the basic idea seems alright, but the author did a bad job of screening her textual evidence... \n the \"pseudo lesbian sex lessons\", if i recall correctly, did not involve any doggy style.  in fact, the whole point of that sex lesson was doreah trying to teach daenerys how not to have sex doggy style.  they were face to face the whole time.  also, the \"pseudo lesbian sex lessons\" in littlefinger's brothel also involved only face-to-face. \n the only time i remember seeing a blowjob was that gay scene between renly and loras.  even if one of them was a female, i don't think this thesis would apply to this case.  it'd be one of the exceptions to the \"doggystyle/blowjob -> dispassionate dominance\" trope. \n so": "gameofthrones",

As far as \"alignment\" systems go, the DnD system is relatively complex, but it by far fails to account for the full breadth of human motivation and capture the full complexity of what we value and desire. \n Besides, you can go into all sorts of discussion about what \"good and evil\" really means.  Is selfishness evil or just neutral?  If you kill people to save people, is that good or neutral?  If you're motivated to do horrible things for the sake of love (as is implied for Lautrec, who wears armour that has the arms of the love goddess embracing him) is that evil?  Is the illusions and pretense that Gwyndolin is putting up in Anor Londo, what with trying to trick the PC into temporarily extending the age of fire (see that one lore video by Epic Name Bro) good or evil?  You could say it's evil because it's manipulating others to make huge sacrifices for something that's really ultimately futile, the Age of Fire will burn out eventually one way or the other, even if you do link the fires.

            "I have no doubt that language shapes thought, but another mistake you're making is lumping japanese and chinese into the same category.  Because they're all the same right? \n As I said, I'm a chinese speaker, so now let me translate the phrase, \"I am very happy because I got a gift from Professor Professorson.\"  in the same way you did in japanese. \n >I am very happy because I got a gift from Professor Professorson. \n >\u6211\u5f88\u9ad8\u5174\u5e94\u4e3a\u6211\u4eceProfessorson\u6559\u6388\u6536\u5230\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u793c\u7269\u3002 \n Now in pinyin: \n >wo3 hen3 gao1xing4 ying1wei2 wo3 cong2 Professorson jiao1shou4 shou3 dao4 le yi1g4e li3wu4. \n wo=I; hen=very; gaoxing=happy; yingwei=because; wo=I; cong=from; Professorson=Professorson; jiaoshou=professor; shou=receive; dao le=[verb auxiliaries that indicate past perfect tense]; yige=a; liwu=gift. \n Now putting it together in literally translated chinese ordered english: \n >I very happy because I from Professorson professor received a gift. \n This is the word order that most I think most native speakers would use.  However, the following word order is also correct: \n >\u6211\u5f88\u9ad8\u5174\u5e94\u4e3a\u6211\u6536\u5230\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u793c\u7269\u4eceProfessorson\u6559\u6388\u3002 \n >I very happy because I received a gift from Professorson professor. \n Now as you can see, if we just added an \"am\" after the \"I\" and put the \"professor\" in front of the guy's name, the second sentence is correct english.  The first sentence, if you also add some strategic commas, is also correct english, it just sounds a bit strange.  However, in neither case does the sentence sound \"backwards\". \n In the sentence we used here, there was no semantic complexity, all the words are commonplace and mundane and can be translated into direct equivalents.  And as for the grammar, as you can see chinese grammar is not that different from english.  For the most part, chinese has Subject Verb Object sentence word order.  I believe japanese is SOV. \n In the article you linked to the TED site, most of the examples have to do with semantic content of words.  Certain languages have certain words that mean a certain shade of meaning that other languages don't have, or some languages use certain words more than others, or certain concepts are embedded into certain phrases, and so that influences thought.  It's kind of like \"eskimos have 500 words for snow\" (this example probably not actually true but that's the idea).  Only one example is actually about the grammar of the language, which is the example about people who happen to speak a \"futureless languages\" saving more, I would question the accuracy of that statement.  There's no way to separate correlation from causation on that fact.  It could be a causal effect from language to thought to action, but I think it's more likely to be a completely incidental fact that has nothing to do with anything. \n Anyways, getting back to our sentence with professor proffessorson.  As you can see from my analysis, grammar and form differences between english and chinese are vastly overblown.  I can't possibly how you could look at \"I very happy because I from Professorson professor received a gift\" and conclude that chinese people think in some sort of \"circular\" manner. \n As for your example with Japanese, I see SOV order and I see a lot of honorifics (both of which btw are lacking in chinese).  However, other than the honorifics and the word order I'm still not sure what you mean by \"asian (or at least japanese at any rate) people speak, and therefore think, 'backwards' or \"circular;' \".  In what way is it backwards or circular?  Tell me exactly what sorts of substantial effects on thought that grammatical quirks have.  Do you see any of this \"backwardness\" or \"circularity\" in the international student's essay? \n (Your annotated paragraph is slightly difficult to follow, perhaps you can write it in literally translated japanese ordered english similar to what I did with chinese?) \n I agree that, in theory, language can have an effect on thought.

            "I didn't think of that, this is a very good point, \n however, I still insist that since an author writes a story to express himself, we still have a kind of responsibility as readers to try to understand what the author's meaning was, before creating and instilling our own meanings. \n isn't literary criticism all about attempting to figure out what a story is \"trying to say\"?  notice how i say \"story\" instead of \"author\".  which just means that, yes, I agree with you in that what the meaning that the  story  is trying to express can be somewhat divorced from what the  author  was trying to say.  but nevertheless, the author is the one who wrote the story.  even if you disagree with my assertion that us readers have an obligation to try to understand the author's message, it is still impossible to separate the story and the author completely, and to understand the former, it is always very insightful to understand the latter.  I strongly hold that this \"can of worms\" that you refer to in your last paragraph is an integral and fundamental element to literature, though not the only element. \n because come on, face it, the author embeds his mental dna into his story when he writes it, the story is born from the author's head like athena from that of zeus.  and no, the story is not a thinking being which has a mind of it's own like athena is.  the \"mind\" of the story is a piece of work which is a fragment of, and woven from, the author's own mind, forged from the fires of his psyche.  I will not say that this piece of work is completely static, but it's certainly not dynamic like athena.  if it grows, it will grow like stalactite, or a crystal, and not like an organic being. \n as nerdysweet said, it is difficult to prove what the author's intention was.  but if you think this is difficult, then how difficult do you think it is to prove what the \"true\" meaning of the story is?  You can't prove what the author's intention was, but the author certainly did have somewhat of an intention, and what the author's intention was is an objective fact.  it either was his intention, or it wasn't.  we probably will have a difficult time determining which is which, but it's theoretically possible.  but how is the \"true meaning of the story\" in anyway objective?  how is it even theoretically possible to determine the \"true\" meaning of the story?  it's now just a matter of subjective interpretation, and on what your criteria for \"true meaning\" is.  I suppose now, it's just a matter of, \"what did I 'take' from the story?\"  and, \"what will most people 'take' from the story upon reading it?\"": "literature",

            "I'm a 22 year old female who works in government/ politics and I definitely notice that I, and many of the female staffers, dress in more feminine clothes, especially the younger generations. I tend to stick to pencil skirts and dresses, as opposed to pant suits. For one, I find skirts more comfortable (I'm 5'1\" so finding good fitting pants is a chore).

I think politics has another aspect to it though- being in the public eye as much as politicians, staff, and lobbyists are, one is expected to look good. I would say a good 90% of the successful female lobbyists in the state capital I work in, are skinny, fashionable dressers, that wear 3\"+ heels, tight skirts, and bright colors. \n An interesting dichotomy though, is that female legislators do not wear as feminine of outfits as compared with their female staff members. In our capital, we have a House and Senate, with 4 female Senators.

Most of the female legislators stick to pantsuits, or if they are older, the \"old lady fashions,\" as I have coined it- things you wouldn't see on anyone other than your 55+ year old teachers, librarians, secretaries, etc. Perhaps it is because our capital is close to a university with a fantastic public policy program, but the age of most staffers is between 20-30, and so we see a lot more female staffers wearing bright colors, wedge heels, 5\" heels, etc. \n I just find that female fashion has so much more wiggle room for what may or may not be socially acceptable, than what guys have.

In the article they even mentioned women from across the world (South Africa, Romania, etc). that feel their breasts negatively impact their sport. \n The other thing to remember is that breast development is heavily dependent on hormones; not just weight. While being active and fit will likely keep your breasts from becoming unnecessarily large (or possibly what you're referring to as \"huge\"), that's definitely not always the case.

However, the TAs/ Grad students that teach German at the lower levels are for the most part actively pursuing teaching German as a career, or becoming a German professor so they are, on a whole, fine.

            "it depends on what kind of reader you are, and what you like in a book. the three most well-known works are each very different in tone, structure, style. \n WARNING: i'm an arm-chair Tolkienista & my friends know better than to ask me anything about any of it anymore, i get carried away! i was a weird kid who wanted to do things \"in order\" so i read Silmarillion first (as a sixth-grader, yes, girl nerd.) going from that to The Hobbit was jarring for me, but i still ended up loving all of them. \n Silmarillion is like a history or the Mahabharata or bible, and starts with the creation of Middle Earth, through wars, vendettas, tragedies, love stories, and goes just about to the \"end\" of the world, so chronologically it comes first. it gives you a lot of context and a deeper understanding of Tolkien's world, different peoples, different characters and events, so well worth reading, and ok to read in bits and pieces IMO. \n BUT if you read Silmarillion first all the way through, you'll hit spoilers for some of the twists in Hobbit & the LotR series... \n so if you do start with it, you may want to STOP near the middle of the final section \"Rings of Power and the Third Age\" - right after the alliance attacks Sauron in Mordor. save the rest for after you read LotR & Hobbit. \n if you plan to see The Hobbit film when it comes out in December, you may want to read it first so you can go see the film in a theater. \n otherwise,  my advice  would be to start with the  Lord of the Rings , as it would be the most accessible for you as an adult new to Tolkien, and works fine all by itself. \n if you get into LotR and feel sad to reach the end, then you'll breeze through the Hobbit as a prequel and not be too bothered by the somewhat less dire style & story-line. \n and hopefully you'll be interested enough in the mythology that you'll want to read Silmarillon to answer various questions or get the deeper back-story on the peoples and events in the other two. everything else can safely be read anywhere along the line, i think. \n keep in mind, too, that Tolkien meant these as a reconstructed sort of  mythology for the British peoples. so the story movement is mostly 'big picture\" with archetypal themes, poetry, songs, languages...there is character development for some of the major actors, but in a 'heroic' way, not a  personal  way so much--flawed people generally fall victim to their flaws, others are doomed by fate or by the actions of their ancestors, and so on. \n anything else you want to ask, fire away, i won't spoil anything for you!": "books",
            "I love this stuff! Thanks! \n From some reading (not all exactly the most established or verifiable sources I admit but mostly with merit and some fairly well proven and mainstream) it was the last of the really big glacial maximums that opened up those areas around Ireland, Scotland etc. and the whole big 'Doggerland' plains. \n That last of which was initially hugely fertile, so as temps warmed up, plants, animals, and early humans pretty much made a land-rush into it...partly for space to get away from others, partly for the excellent hunting. \n Anyway, it was likely a sort of prehistoric cross-roads or northern capital for a good while. \n But as those glaciers melted, it pushed everyone back south or to the west or east/north-east. Then a couple big underwater landslides (like Storegga?  washed a lot of it over with tsunamis. That must have sucked. \n So yeah, a LOT of archeological remains are underwater now, as  donthack  &  cul_maith  mentioned & linked to. Sad so much is lost, but there are scientists now who literally rush out onto tidal plains at low tide to dig... \n If you look at languages, folk-tales, traditions etc. you see some interesting similarities amongst the modern peoples who live all around there now in coastal nations (parts of Scotland & the northern Isles, Denmark, Netherlands, Norway, etc.)": "ireland",
            "Born and raised American from the north-eastern U.S., who learned after working for some years down in The Old South of the U.S., that locals there had two ways they thought of us northerners: \"Yankees\" and \" DAMN  Yankees\". \n I imagine that as tourists from anywhere to anywhere else, something similar can usually also be said. \n If it helps, the quickest & easiest way to deal with any overly annoying Americans on holiday in Scotland for whatever reason--certainly any clueless enough to say they are \" Scotch \", is to offer us a bit of  tactfully  put and well-meaning correction... \n I sincerely hope that at least  most  of us will respond with an apology and an offer to stand you a coffee/tea or pint, and will actually want to understand how to better communicate, learn something from it all. (The more boorish remainder will just storm off--so you're set, either way!) \n As the IrateGlaswegian and others below point out--chances are you have a local pub that is older than our national capitols. And many of us still have 2 to 4 of our grandparents who came over directly from somewhere else, or their parents did. \n So it is kind of normal for us back home to identify to one another that way \"Oh, your name is XXXX? What is that, Italian? Polish?\" We forget when we have a chance to actually go  visit  those countries that people there probably don't do that. \n Like the OP, on my first and only trip, I didn't go blabbing about, but locals did ask sometimes, and then I'd just say my dad's family came over from Wishaw in the 30's, kind of thing. Having mainly Scottish & Irish, but also a few Welsh, English, Danes & Swiss-by-way-of-Germany, and lord knows what else if I could look far enough back, I just like to know where family foods, religious/holiday stuff, funny sayings and stories and things like that trace back to, and try to learn about them. \n I only have one living relative left over here who was actually born in Scotland--Wishaw, 1912, and at 101 she's probably the coolest & most witty, sharp-tongued person I know (she can make grown men shut up and look at their feet in shame with a single word, or blush over a compliment--seriously, I love her dearly but I'm half scared to death of her sometimes too!)": "Scotland",
            "you don't sound too ranty to me. \n i'm 45 and have been trying different approaches to working out exactly what you describe, from pretty much the time i walked out with my undergrad & the overwhelming (for us at that time at least) attached debt way back in 1990. \n you are not alone in finally choosing what feels right to you, over money or \"status\" or whatever others have pushed you towards. \n your insight crosses many demographics, and generations. although personally i do believe that the pressure (and the school debt) has really gotten a lot worse over these last 20 years or so. it makes me sick, how that wastes so much potential and beats people down. \n the only \"improvement\" i've seen is that now more young people do seem to see that there IS a choice, and in general these issues have a wider audience today, there is more awareness, and more people (i hope) are finding ways to make choices based on their ethics--maybe they are more willing, or (i fear) maybe at least partly it has become that much more stark? if you're going to end up struggling one way or the other, may as well at least know you're doing something worthwhile. your health and your sanity are far more important than money or things. \n i also think that more younger people today are able to see the bigger picture, understand better how things work, and see how/when they are just getting screwed/screwing others, and recognize that they do have the right to refuse to play a losing hand, and try something else. \n so maybe there is some hope? \n of course i don't know your parents, but they at least sound more flexible than my own have been over the years. but really, sometimes they just don't know...they want you to be happy and feel good about what you do, but they really have no good advice for how you should make that happen. \n regardless of age/generation, i fear that too many people just do what they think they are \"supposed to do\" or what they've been told they \"have to do\" and they don't really think it through. at least that is how i see my own parents' \"choices\" -- ie they never really realized they even  could  choose for themselves? so how could they have ever taught me what they didn't know for themselves? \n for your own situation, if you are doing something you believe in, if you are making a difference, if you are getting at least good  energy  back from your work--this is something you can't measure in dollars. if you can find a way to make an ok life for yourself on less income, then it is worth it for being able to know that you are doing something positive with your life. \n no one, not even your family, should try to tell you otherwise. anyone in your life who doesn't \"get it\" well, you can try to teach them, but realize they probably never  will  \"get it\" and don't let them make you feel bad, and try not to resent them too much for not knowing any better? (why waste your energy on it, you know? right...easier said than done, but worth trying to keep in mind.)": "lostgeneration",
            "As a fellow American, let me see if I can provide some general perspective from what I've read and followed here & elsewhere. Please correct me, Scots, if I get anything wrong. And please forgive me, Peg, if I presume to tell you things you already know! \n First, yes, Scotland is already, and always has been, her own country. \n The U.K. is four such countries joined up (Wales, Northern Ireland, Scotland, and England.) Next year's ref is about Scotland ending their part in that arrangement and going fully solo again. Everyone living & working in Scotland as their home nation by choice or birth will get to vote, and also some Scottish folk outside Scotland (such as military.) So a good number of voters will actually have been born in England, Wales, etc., or for that matter anywhere in the world, and may be fairly recent residents in Scotland. \n Why vote 'yes'?  I think there are many reasons, and some are more important/valid to some voters, than to others. Mainly it seems to me to come down to economics, and to representation in governance and affairs within Scotland, within the current U.K. Union, and internationally--so, everything, really! \n Until not all that long ago, Scotland did not really even have their own home Parliament anymore to govern their own purely internal business. So partly this next ref will be about taking that all the way to full independence, or not. \n Why vote 'no'?  With any such major change, there is risk, and many outcomes can't be fully known until they are tested (if the ref wins a 'yes' vote.) A 'yes' vote will impact many aspects of the economy, social services, relations with/in the European Union, alliances--everything, some things much more than others. Some voters are already sure they will  not  be better off personally, or that Scotland herself won't be better off. They likely have some valid concerns. Some voters prefer to consider the current U.K. as a whole, see themselves primarily within that context--as \"British\" more than \"Scottish\", etc., and worry the remaining U.K. will suffer if Scotland is no longer a member. They are likely right that without Scotland, the remaining U.K. nations will certainly feel her loss in some key ways. And, does this open the door for the rest to also separate? \n Why do the polls look the way they do right now?  Understandably a lot of voters are being cautious at this stage. Like anyone anywhere, they want to know if they will really be better off, or could some things end up worse for them? So likely most voters aren't ready to say for certain how they will vote. This seems wise enough to me (unlike in America where we tend to instantly voice a very loud opinion on things that don't even affect us personally, or before we've even fully understood the issues, then we change our minds 12 times before we vote. That's just our style here in the U.S.!) \n Why does the media paint a somewhat different picture, when most voters are likely still fairly undecided? Well, it seems most U.K. media, even within Scotland, currently sides editorially with a 'no' vote and with staying part of the Union. But who knows what powers or reasoning or concerns are behind that! Their mainstream major media seems to be much like ours is here...more 'conservative' or 'old guard' or status quo, whatever, and a bit out of touch with a lot of (at least Scottish) regular people? \n I can't speak at all to the details and intricacies of the economic and other factors, pro or con, within or without Scotland. You will need actual Scots for that (but it is the middle of the night there right now...you may get more answers in the morning.) \n BUT, and here I will go out on a limb rather more than I have already-- \n I think one major long-term factor has to do with how voting & governance are structured across the U.K. nations. The population U.K.-wide is spread very unevenly across the whole (much as it is here in the U.S.) with the bulk of voters being in and around London, and then to a lesser extent other more urban regions, mainly within England. \n But  unlike our U.S. system, there seems to be no mechanism to ensure that low-population areas aren't simply drowned out and dragged along with whatever high-density areas want? \n So imagine if the U.S. was run only by the House of Reps (no Senate) and Presidential elections were flat one-voter one-vote across the board (no electoral difference between States.) States like Alaska & Wyoming, and to a lesser extent most rural voters in general even in NY, CA or PA, would end up having little or no say at the Federal level. NYC, LA, etc. would run everything. After a while, you can imagine that Alaska, Wyoming etc. might start talking about going their own way...or that a critical mass of rural voters everywhere would start getting angry (which, we kind of  still  have that issue here!) \n Someone in a different thread stated that one could ignore all the Scottish voters for the last, I forget how many years or decades, and it would have no effect on U.K.-wide elections or policies. If true, you can certainly see there is a problem there, at least from our perspective. \n If the U.K. had already had a more proportional electoral system, there might now not be this move for Scottish independence. But how does that change when the voters who want it, can't get themselves heard at that level in the first place? Right. Chicken-and-egg problem. \n To quote someone I'd rather not quote, but in a different more sensible context: Democracy is messy. \n I can't say I have any clue how the ref will turn out. I can't really even say from any truly informed & practical  Scottish  perspective how I think it  should  turn out. The few Scots I know offline are uniformly in the 'yes' camp, and have been from the start (but they are younger, 'artsy' types, so...take that as you will.) \n In general I believe that smaller Democracies tend to be more representative of, more responsive and fairer to, their citizens. \n I also just have a sentimental soft-spot, and I'd like to see how Scotland will fare on her own. IF a majority of Scots can be convinced to step out onto the global stage, IF that is indeed what most of them want, I really hope they get the chance. It won't be easy, but I think it may be worth the risk for them. \n From a global perspective, as an American, I think the world would benefit from having an independent Scotland take her equal place among all nations. And I'm wondering who I talk to in D.C. about applying for a Scottish Ambassadorship! HA! I will eat the black pudding  and  the haggis every day for breakfast, if that helps me qualify! Never tried the Irn Bru yet, but I pledge to that as well. \n Thanks for your interest, and your question :)  I hope you get some better answers here than mine!": "Scotland",
            "Australians, New Zealanders, Irish, Scottish--all of these native English speakers have very heavy accents, but I doubt they try to conform to any 'standard', and would rightly feel insulted if one tried to insist that they do. \n Even across the U.S. we have a variety of fairly strong accents (Boston, the deep Southern States) and we can't always even understand everything one another says at first. \n I work in an American university with a fairly strong international presence and I really enjoy hearing the different accents. I've always thought that the Indian accents I encounter on campus often sound rather 'educated' to my ear, very pleasant. Indians are easier to understand than some Aussies, Kiwis or Scots sometimes! (I realize my personal experience is limited somewhat by the campus demographic, and I have not ever traveled in India.) \n For anyone who is already making the effort to use a second-language to communicate with me, I can't imagine expecting any further concessions from them, that would seem rude of me. I would certainly never expect someone from Texas to try and use a Boston accent--that would be sort of humorous, actually :)": "india",
            "Hi. First, good luck with your visit and I'm sure you will have a great time. Expect rain. \n There is a whole big political thing going on over the next year in Scotland which you may have heard about ;) so a very interesting time to visit, especially given any interest in history or politics! \n I hope you don't mind some thoughts from an over-bearing know-it-all and overly wordy fellow American... \n I only made my first trip last spring. I  thought  I knew a lot about Scotland from before that...but during and after is really when I've learned a  lot  more that is relevant and current (some of it via this sub) that puts things-Scottishy here in the States into better perspective as compared to the actual Scotland of today. \n (Scots please forgive my stepping in & feel welcome to ignore or correct me!) \n First, Scots are as diverse in many ways as people are in any other place, even if it doesn't always look so at first from the outside. Where will you be? That may make some difference, but I'll just try to be generic here. \n SO, you will find people take different things differently, around the various regions and cities. There may well be some guy in some bar in some town somewhere over there who will prove everything I am about to say is wrong! HA! \n That being said, what some are eager to talk about, may offend others, etc. And that diversity includes accents & dialects too BTW...you may have zero trouble following folks in Edinburgh, but then meet others where you go red with embarrassment having to ask them to repeat or explain! I find a smile always helps. \n Now...ermmm...at the risk of egregious over-simplification, generalization and even a wee bit of stereotyping on both sides of the Atlantic: U.S. peeps with Scottish parents, gramps, whatnot who are at all interested in that aspect of their family make-up, culture or history kinda sorta take a lot of that  much  more seriously than actual, normal, present-day Scots do themselves (as Catses said already.) \n We are a very young country, comparatively, and we're nearly all from somewhere else at some point not too far back, so it is normal here to share that kind of stuff. It is NOT normal in some other parts of the world where the local pub is older than America is. \n You may compare your concern to someone visiting the States today and wondering if having Civil War era southern \"rebel\" family connections will get them hassled in a bar in Boston...it won't (unless someone just wants to be a blow-hard in general and have some fun at the 'foreigners' expense, in which case, move along, right? 'cause that guy won't think his night is complete until he's cracking skulls.) \n I've been around to different U.S. Games & related festivals, so I'm familiar with how a few, isolated...wanna be's?...think they are all Joe Braveheart or something. \n I don't want to judge and who knows where they are coming from really, but...c'mon, seriously? Celebrate and explore your family's history and music and literature and your immigrant ancestor's struggles and all that, but why on earth try to resurrect conflicts or hard feelings from 100's of years ago from the other side of the ocean? \n Some of our ancestors did carry that stuff over here when they moved, but why anyone tries to hold onto it now is just...really? Like we don't have enough present-day tensions here or internationally! Much more likely you'll end up in a Scottish bar having heated words over Syria or Obama or sports or your favorite beer, then someone going all quiet and saying \"SO you are a  Campbell  you say?\" \n Yes, the Glen Coe Massacre was a real and very tragic  historical  event, but was itself at the time more politically complex than just some kind of family feud, I think. And today, the people around the world who carry any of the surnames involved really have no culpability for things that happened so many years before their parents were even born. Plenty of people with those surnames today aren't even distantly related to the families in question. \n You don't mention what part of the U.S. you are in, down South maybe? But if anyone is giving you attitude at a damn  U.S.  Highland Games, they really need to chill out and swear off the whisky tent (and they've probably never even  been  to Scotland!) \n So I really wouldn't even worry about that kind of crap happening on your trip! \n BUT, now on a related note I  will  say that I think today for at least  some  actual Scots, it can get a wee bit tiresome or at least weird how many Americans especially show up over there with a picture in our heads frozen in time from ages ago, that is largely a false, overly romanticized (sometimes insulting) image in the first place...going on about our \"clan\" and our 3X grandfather from X and where can I get my  official  tartan. Most of us really don't mean anything offensive by it and just have no idea...still...after a while you know? \n Most Scots are maybe too polite to point it out, but I think it does puzzle some the way we can seem to feel this attachment, generations down the road, and wonder why we aren't ok just being Americans on holiday, enjoying the culture and all, making friends and having a good time when we visit, like normal tourists from elsewhere do all the time in Scotland :) \n I do NOT mean to make you feel odd here or like this is a 'silly' thing to ask about, no honest question is ever silly, and it shows some cultural sensitivity on your part that you take the chance to ask about it before you travel (we Americans should all make a bit of effort to learn about places & the people who live in them, before we show up there. At our best sometimes we are still like large dogs who should not be allowed indoors.) \n So please don't take my words here as anything like that--I know I don't always come across the way I mean to in writing! \n Certainly yes do read up on lots of different aspects and times in Scottish, UK, Irish, Norwegian, Roman/Viking-era etc. history before you go and you will get a lot more out of the sites you visit. I'm happy to give my own rec's if you need ideas for where to go! \n I am sure that you, being a History major, probably already know what a fascinating and complex story has unfolded over the centuries in that part of the world, with far-flung, major influences! You can't hardly beat it for anyone interested in Western-European History, modern Philosophy, Natural Science, Economics...or  American  history, too, for that matter! The more background you have, the more you can appreciate what you see while there. \n My own dad's peeps were mostly just coal miners down around and between Glasgow and Edinburgh, some of them really Irish or English, some by way of the Ulster plantations, on my mom's side they're too far back to worry about, so anyway we aren't anybody 'clan wise' and there's no lofty family stories there (aside from bits like how my dad's grandma was the \"go-to\" lady on her ship to America for curing head-lice in other people's kids so they'd not be turned back in NYC, really \"posh\" stuff like that!) \n All of that to say that I really do empathize though with your personal interest in your own family and with your desire to learn about and see where they came from,  and  with feeling like there is some element of connection there, because yes of course there is. \n My personal advice for getting off on the best foot with actual Scots (thanks to ones I met over there, and folks here too) or really for getting on well as an American with  anyone  in any other country, is: \n *Pay attention to what is accepted polite behavior where you are. \n *Do more listening than you do talking until you get warmed up to people and they get warmed up to you. \n *Do your best to leave most assumptions or preconceptions back at home. \n *Show your hosts the courtesy of letting them tell or show you about themselves and their home and their culture (yeah, I am violating that one a bit here just now...) \n Most people anywhere are just people, some things are different, but a lot more things are usually pretty similar. I know that sounds a bit school-marmish maybe but then I am a 45 year old librarian lady here so...I am supposed to sound like that. \n Unless it is you or at least both of your parents who were born in Scotland, then you are (like me) more American than anything else, like it or not! It can be  almost  as much bad form to denigrate or deny or downplay that when abroad, as it is when jag-off Americans go mouthing off about how \"great\" we are...if you think about it. \n Sure we know that some folks have inaccurate assumptions about us and about things here, too, but to be brutally honest, we  do  enjoy a lot of advantages and privileges etc. whether we feel good about it or not, that we just take for granted and never think about. \n You may find that some younger Scots are a lot more interested in hearing about America, and could not care less about your surname. \n Even if it is your grandparents or further back who are/were Scottish and you know the name of their town, sure, share that if it feels right, certainly once/if someone asks. That is part of your interest in visiting, after all. But I wouldn't  lead  with that... \n I dunno...many words, how much actual information?": "Scotland"

            "First thing : as everyone else have said, this therapist shouldn't do what he does. Confidentiality is essential between patient and therapist. And like BrighTide has said, even in the \"best case scenario\", the situation doesn't look very good. \n You may not want to report him, and it's your choice. But the first thing you should do is talk to your wife. 1) she has to know what he has said and 2) You know your wife better than me, but I'm pretty sure the \"it's been 3 years, little progress, lets try someone different\" won't work. I mean, she has all the reasons to believe her therapist, he is in a dominant position (he could have suggested that she was making progress, that she was realizing that you weren't the best husband, that she needed him, etc. whatever he want). But again, I do not know him or your wife, it's all suppositions. \n The second thing is : even if she said that, and if it's true, I don't think it means what you believe. What I understand from what you write is that you think \"doesn't love you\" = \"dislike you\" (or at least \"is indifferent and just follow passively the events\"). From what you are saying, I think I understand the feeling of your wife, because this is how I feel. \n > is her determination to stay with me her version of love? \n And if it was me, I'd said yes, it is. Because she is with you and doesn't want to go elsewhere. It's likely she is where she want to be. But you can't be certain unless you speak with her. \n It's just an hypothesis, but maybe you would be depressed too if you had the impression of being not \"wired\" for love, in a situation where you would have absolutely all things to make you happy but where you couldn't feel that seemed right. Where you can't really find where you belong. And the worst thing is you can't really tell your husband because he is quite emotional about you, and can't really understand because he seems \"normal\", like all people surrounding you. You fear that if he could misunderstood what you have to say, and want to leave you. You feel different, broken in the eyes of the media, society, movie, books, and what the others couple say. And you don't know how to fix it. So you see a therapist, but it doesn't change anything, because he has is point of view. So, nothing works, and you become more and more depressed, obsessed by the fact that you are depressed and you shouldn't be. (I'm not talking about personal feeling here, it's really a total guess) \n Calmly, gently approach her, and talk to her, in a understanding and non aggressive way. Try to find all the reason of her depression (and do not forget that depression is a disease), how she feels about you, about the children, about her life, etc. It will take some time (I'm talking about year-ish time here), but I really believe the moment she will be strong enough to face the truth about her feelings, and share them with you, it will be a huge improvement in your relationship, and maybe she won't need a therapist anymore. \n Maybe a little \"advice\" here (disguised in question) : in your point of view, how do you determine what is love? Who and what can forge (and have forged) your feelings and your perception on feelings? And from what you know of her, what are her answers? \n In my humble opinion, the only solution for her is to accept herself, her limits, and become strong enough to be absolutely certain to make her own choice because she want it. The only question is : \"how do I want to live my life?\" And from my point of view, the answer include you (supposition, again).": "relationships",

Try to imagine it. \n And now, from what you know from her and you, can you pinpoint behaviors on how would  really  be the marriage/child? What would change? Think objectively.

You don't make children with the first man that cross your road, she seems to want a serious relationship. \n It's purely egocentric, but it is the same thing for you : you want to be with her until you decide if you want children/marriage, whether or not it has an influence on her ability to procreate. \n > my sister has rang me and screamed that I'd be a fool not to marry her. \n Yeah, she seems like a nice girl. But you know what? What your sister want is not necessarily what you want and what you need. It would be dishonest for you to tell her to stay if you don't mean it. Sometimes, if a near-perfect partner doesn't fell right for you, you shouldn't force the relationship. \n It's your decision, not her. You can also see this classic situation when the parents judge the new girl/boyfriend. \"s/he's not good enough\", \"you could do better\", etc. They perceive what it should be (and in your case \"don't let her go\"), forgetting you are the one involved, so the one who should make the definitive choice. Sometimes they are right, sometimes they are wrong, but they don't have the same value as you do, so it shouldn't be considered if you truly know the life you want. \n So... What do you want? \n Is it compatible with what she want?": "relationships",

It's a part of her birthday present, and this month,  it's Japan  ! :) \n We can buy little things here, but we can't send postcards from Japan. So I was hoping some redditors could help us by writing postcards! \n \n Why? \n \n The truth is, she\u2019s actually having a hard time, trying to figure out what she really wants in life. It was her 30th birthday, and I think she's doing some kind of \u201cthirty midlife crisis\u201d. She's got a job (as graphic designer), a great bf of 10 years, owns a flat (she\u2019s paying off), but she doesn\u2019t know if it\u2019s the life she wants to live anymore. She is dreaming of freedom, seeks change, wants to travel alone all over the world, see different things, meet amazing people and take some time to think about her life\u2026 But she doesn\u2019t know if she is \u201cbrave\u201d enough to do it (reason and emotion say something clearly different and she doesn\u2019t know which one trust). \n So why the postcards? I don\u2019t know if she should follow her thoughts, and I don\u2019t believe I have to influence her. I just want her to be happy. It\u2019s a gift, to help her see something \u201cdifferent\u201d. And I believe Redditors are the best to make something unique! \n \n What can I do? \n \n If you\u2019re willing to help:  \u3069\u3046\u3082\u3042\u308a\u304c\u3068\u3046\u3054\u3056\u3044\u307e\u3059!  (But if not, thank you for reading this long post, and have a good day  ;-) ). \n It\u2019ll be perfect if it\u2019s in Japanese. Anything is great! She is cheerful, open-minded, value friendship and family, helpful, and have a great sense of humor. You can write funny things, silly things, words of wisdom or hope, wishes, poems, even dictionary definition or instructions manual if you want\u2026 You can also draw, add a real flower or leaf, a picture of animal, or anything that could take her on a journey\u2026 It\u2019s entirely free, so  do what you want ! \n PM me (or comment) and I\u2019ll send you the address (it\u2019s in France). \n Even if I\u2019m not wealthy, I believe I can afford to reimburse you, one way or another, so if you want, I can give you something in exchange for the card+fees (Sending a card in return? Money via paypal? An awesome ultimate upvote?). I don't believe it will be costly (~70Y for the stamp, but I don't know the price of postcards in Japan), but it's the least I can do ;) \n And sorry for my English and broken Japanese, I hope it wasn\u2019t too hard to read!": "japan",
            "It is a simplification, but you do use \"100%\" of your brain. It depend of what you means by 100%. It's a tricky definition. \n Do all parts of you brain are working/activating? Definitely yes. Do all neurons of your brain are firing at their maximum speed? Hell no. you wouldn't be able to live with it (see for example epilepsy). \n Take any studies done with fMRI. You will see small cluster of activation in some area of the brain for one given task. But it doesn't mean that the rest of your brain is not \"activated\". \n Basically, to see that kind of things, you take the activity of your brain doing the task and you subtract the activity of your brain not doing the task. But if you observed the BOLD signal of your brain not doing the task, you would see a global activation. Same thing with an EEG signal : you have continuous activation. A continuous blood flow. A continuous consumption. It's not necessarily constant, it can have slight variation. And when you do specific task a neuron or group of neuron can either be inhibited, or activated. \n But even when resting, your brain has an activity. \n When you use a specific function that is related to specific part(s) of the brain, some neurons will activate \"more\" (generally, it will increase the frequency of their firing rate, but it can also decrease the frequency of their firing rate). But contrary to popular belief, more is not necessarily good. If you could increase the firing of any neurons with deep brain stimulation, I would advise against it (except if it is a medical reason). If I decide to electrically stimulate your hippocampus, you wouldn't gain extraordinary memory. I could even suggest it would do the opposite (see for example depressive patient treated with electroconvulsive therapy). \n The only possible exception I can think of is if you do not perform a particular task during one day. It would be difficult to do without thinking, planning, feeling emotion, seeing something... But it could be done with motor activation. If I amputate some part of your body (let's say your left arm), the area responsible for motor representation of this limb could not be specifically activated (theoretically. Because it has been suggested that an incorrect activation of sensori-motor representation of missing limb could be associated with the phantom limb perception). \n Because the brain do not like \"unused\" space (and like I said before, no specific activation doesn't necessarily mean no activation, there could be a baseline), it would be replaced after some time (for example, if I cut one of your finger, the next fingers would take over this area).": "askscience",

            "My daughter's 2nd-grade class is doing a project, tied in with the upcoming Olympic games. Each student has been assigned a country, and they'll do a basic report on them and make a poster showing a couple of the main details of the country. Then they'll follow along during the games and keep a running total of their country's medals. \n So, I thought it might be a nice surprise for the kids if I could could create a slideshow of a few folks from each country holding up signs sending greetings to the student and the class. If the greeting pictures have any scenic countryside or landmarks in the background, that would be a nice bonus. \n If anyone wants to help out, send me an e-mail at sirblah42@yahoo.com and I'll let you know all the details. Please let me know which country you're from, so I can let you know which student is assigned there. \n I've received a ton of questions from people, so I'm going to try and cover the most common ones here: \n FAQ: \n What should be in the picture?  Whatever you like, really -- if there's something scenic nearby that you can get in the shot, then terrific. If not, that's ok too -- the important thing is getting something in the picture sending greetings to the student (and the entire class as well, if you like). \n Can I use an old picture?  Sure, several of the submissions I've received are of older pictures that people have photoshopped to add in a greeting to the class. That's perfectly fine! What I'm  not  looking for is just scenic pictures from your country without any greeting. I appreciate people helping, but the key thing here is getting a message of greeting to the kids. \n How long do we have?  The kid's projects are due in by January 30th, so if people could send them by the 24th, that will give me enough time to sort everything. \n Will we get to see the project when it's done?  Yes, certainly! All the pictures will be in an Imgur folder which the teacher can use to show the class. Once the project is complete, I'll be sharing the folder with everyone (and hopefully there will be a few \"thank you!\" pics from the class as well). \n What's a '2nd-Grader'?  A kid, about 7-8 years old, in their third year year of formal education (kindergarten, 1st grade, 2nd grade). \n Are you their teacher?  No, my daughter is in this class -- I'm just a dad with too much time on his hands who thought this would be a nice surprise for the kids. \n Didn't this post used to have all the details in it?  Yes, but some were concerned about the level of detail in there, so I've removed all information about the school and the kids. When someone e-mails me about participating, then I let them know all the details. \n Thanks  so much  to everyone who has already helped out!": "newzealand"

That the already rich benefit is an unseemly side effect but better they do better than everyone do worse. \n Higher rates result in the banks demanding a higher amount of money, monthly, from those with a mortgage. Those people are already struggling, higher interest rates would punish those people and lead to people becoming homeless. And/Or, it would result in a lot of people redirecting their money towards mortgage payments taking money away from the 'economy'. The demand drop would be catastrophic for the high street, and the service sector more generally. And can you imagine the effect rampany foreclosure would have on business confidence and the construction sector? \n The people with no savings, as a result of being on low wages, arguably do the worst out of the entire deal as the low rates allow inflation to be higher than normal. Inflation has run above target for most of the time since the crisis but is now marginally below; their real wages have suffered but they'll recover in time and their after-tax wages were somewhat protected by the increase in personal allowance. \n Those who have savings are having their money 'siphoned' away but it's a price worth paying to prevent mass homeless and all the negative effects from the first group defaulting. \n The Rich are doing the best out of the deal, granted, but in terms of net benefit those who might lose their house (Their most expensive possession) are probably doing the best. Also, the rich people's property portfolios will, with the exception of those based in London, only be returning to pre-crisis levels. The reason the stock market is doing so well is QE. That's a good thing. People would otherwise have invested in government debt, by making it a less attractive proposition people had to park their money in some other location. \n We're endorsing this policy to bail out those who became over indebted in the boom years, primarily because if we didn't we'd all suffer.

It's simply not true that everyone else is pushed closer to zero, the first group is being pulled back from the brink. Further, last quarter saw private sector wages rise faster than inflation. If it weren't for the deliberate below-inflation pay rises in the public sector we would likely have seen overall pay rise faster.

            "The Scottish Government is given a block grant each year from Westminster. The size of this grant is based off of the previous years budget, plus an increment. This increment is based on taking into account how much additional spending/less spending is programmed in for England in the coming year on a per capita basis. If spending goes up \u00a310 per capita, per annum, in England, then it will go up \u00a310 per capita, per annum in Scotland. The same is true of Wales and Northern Ireland. \n The reason the spending levels are higher in Scotland, NI, and Wales - despite a funding formula that ought to lead to a convergence over time, and has been causing convergence in recent years - is that it locks in extra spending that was already allocated as far back as the 70s, when the formula was decided upon and that up until the 90s 'Barnett bypasses' were relatively common. A run-down of how Barnett operates can be found [here]( published by a HoL select committee. \n Anyway, the reality is, the levels of public spending in Scotland, in the aggregate, are controlled in Westminster. Beyond some small levels of hypothecation - that is, Westminster saying that some of the money must be spent in a certain way - how the money is spent is decided on by the Scottish Government. It's not easy to say that any one policy is being funded from anyone place vis-a-vis England. You can really only talk about the relative importance placed on certain areas by the two different administrations. \n If you want to just look at the education budget, a number of changes have been implemented over the past five years. One major one was the creation of 'regional colleges', and the bringing of the colleges from the private sector in to the public. This was done in order to reduce their running costs. \n Another factor is that the number of people attending colleges is down 35%. In part, that is due to a shift in emphasis from part-time courses to full-time courses, so young people are not as disadvantaged as that figure might suggest. Full-time equivalent courses are relatively steady over the past five years. [source]( \n There are other trade offs and decisions being made as well. If you want expand your view from just education, the police services were amalgamated into one national police force: Police Scotland. The operational savings that entailed have allowed the number of police officers to be kept stable i.e. the 1000 extra officers the SNP pledged a while back have been kept on the beat. \n If you want to look at the fiscal balance that this all entails, as I've only talked about spending and not tax revenue, it really depends on how you look at it. Historically, Scotland ran smaller deficits or larger surpluses (the balance) than the rest of the UK did. Recently, with the decline in oil revenues, that situation is starting to reverse, though Scots still pay more in tax, per capita, than the rUK average (as they have done for the past 34 years). For a detailed look at these figures, the GERS report - published by the Scottish Government -is what you're looking for. Either way, it would be wrong to characterise monetary flows north or south of the border as 'aid'.": "ukpolitics",
            "From Eurostat, the source[PDF] in the above link]( \n >Youth Unemployment Rate is the ratio between Unemployed 15-24 Year olds to the Labour Force of 15-24 Year Olds. \n >Youth Unemployment Ratio is the ratio between Unemployment 15-24 Year Olds and the Population of 15-24 Year Olds. \n We're looking at the former. \n The difference between the Labour Force and the Population are those who are economically inactive i.e. those youths who are not employed but also not looking to take up a job. \n Largely this comes from the large number who are in education, though not all who are in education are economically inactive. They are not mutually exclusive. They state the three most common cases for overlap between the categories, in their methodology, for this age range are: \n >1) Being an Apprentice or a Student with a Part Time Job.\n>2) A Student who is looking for a job but does not have one\n>3) A Student who is not looking for a job. \n Case one counts as being employed, two as unemployed, and three as economically inactive. Those who fall in to the third category are the ones responsible for the difference between the unemployment rate and the unemployment ratio (though of course others contribute too, such as those outside education and are without a job and not looking for one (economically discouraged)).": "europe",
            "not speaking English \n To be fair, a lot of Swedish people I know complain about people not speaking English when they go abroad too. I get that it looks bad when people from the UK expect other places to speak English but, at least in the service industries near tourists areas, it's not entirely unreasonable or arrogant to expect Europe's lingua franca to be spoken. \n That said, the only time I, personally, have got annoyed with there being no English speakers around was in Galeao International Airport, in Rio. Then again, I'm pretty sure they could speak English better than they pretended and were trying to use a faux language barrier to scam us out of more money for the taxi fare.": "europe",

At the moment, a majority vote in the Parliament can amend any existing legislation and pass any legislation it wants. On the current operating principles of our parliament, if a bill were put in place that said 'This document can only be amended by a popular referendum or by 65% of the parliament voting in favour', it would have no effect. Any successor parliament could, with merely a majority vote, repeal that act. After repealing that act, or even just striking 65% from the text and inserting 50%, they can then do what they want.

I was not able to pick up my wallet until the following evening, when I arrived around seven pm they told me they were unable to give me my wallet because it was locked in their accounting office to ensure its security and the accountant had left for the day with the only key. I returned the next morning and asked for my wallet, only to be handed the sad empty shell of leather that remained. I immediately called the police and asked for the manager to investigate what happened to my personal property. The police arrived as the manager and accountant returned with a piece of paper along with my still empty wallet, the manager and accountant explained that they had a store policy of destroying any personal property in a wallet left for greater than 90 days to ensure the privacy of the owner is not broken. That's when they showed me and the officer the paper they had brought with them, whoever logged my wallet into their accounting office lost and found had written 1/6/15 instead of 1/6/16 so when the next shift change happened it was noticed and immediately destroyed. \n Corporate is supposed to be contacting me today, however I am unsure what my other options are. \n Contents of wallet-\nID\nPersonal credit card\nPersonal debit card\nCorporate credit card\nMisc.

            "This is a pretty big question, so there's lots of smaller points to consider, and I'm probably missing some: \n \n Japan was a dominant power in Asia for the 50 or so years prior to WWII. They had fought both Russia and China with some level of success. \n \n The US occupied Japan from 1945 to 1952, providing a stabilizing influence. \n \n There was very little if any significant (violent) opposition to the US occupation/rebuilding of Japan. \n \n The US, like they did in Germany and the rest of Europe with the Marshall Plan, poured a ton of money into relief and reconstruction efforts in Japan to the tune of $2 billion, which in those days was a lot of money. \n \n The US occupying leaders had engaged in a land reform in Japan, distributing land to the peasants, and were planning to do the same with industry, breaking up the zaibatsu monopolies, but decided against it in order to provide an Asian economic ally against the Soviets. \n \n Within a few years of Japan regaining its sovereignty, its economic activity was back to pre-war levels and continuing to rise.": "japan",
            "I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but it's somewhat unlikely that this can be achieved. I'll give you the basic realities and suggestions though. \n \n If you haven't been to Japan before, you might want to consider talking to people that work here in your industry to see what the job prospects, pay, and working conditions are like, and/or coming here for a few weeks to see whether you like it. To be perfectly blunt, Japan is like any other country with its drawbacks. In particular, they have a peculiar passive-aggressive treatment of foreigners at times, and from what I've heard in many cases darker skinned people are shunned more often than Asians or whites. This is a general description of course, and may not match other peoples' experiences. \n \n To live and work in Japan, you need a work visa, and a job that will sponsor you for that work visa. The only real exception to this is if you are more or less independently wealthy and can start your own company and self-sponsor. \n \n You are highly unlikely to get a job in Japan without being in Japan first. The only real exceptions to this are if you have some very good contacts that can introduce you, or if you work for a company that has a branch in Japan, and they can transfer you. \n \n To come to Japan and look for work, you need either a Tourist Visa or a Student Visa. You cannot get an employment visa even with the requisite work experience unless you have a sponsor. You cannot work at all on the Tourist Visa, and can't work full time on the Student Visa, so you will probably need to have a significant amount of money saved up prior to coming here. \n \n There is no Visa Waiver program, nor is there a Working Holiday Visa for India (I'm assuming you are an Indian citizen), so if you don't go with a long term Student Visa, you are limited to 90 days in Japan, and you can't really play the fast and loose immigration game that Americans, etc, can play to renew their Visa Waiver. You have to be explicitly approved prior to entry into Japan. \n \n The main jobs for software testing for you are probably going to be in the financial services field -- if you don't speak Japanese well you are going to be pretty limited, and financial services companies (ie, multinational banks) all speak English across the board.": "japan",
            "Not really a 'firing story' per se, but my first experience in Japan was a whirlwind. \n I worked for an American IT consulting company that generally did US-based consulting, and I'd done a few domestic trips to customer sites. This Japanese company with some western management, and with apparently a ton of money lying around, decided to hire a shit-ton of consultants, including some of the people from my company. \n I went to talk to one of my managers about some unrelated project one Friday morning, and he was like 'Hey, do you want to go to Japan?'. And after thinking about it, I was like 'Hey, sure'. I didn't even have a valid passport at the time, so I had to go to the nearest State Department outpost the following Monday, and they got me my passport the same day. I was on a plane to Japan that Friday. For three months. \n It was a lot of hard work, but they put me up in a nice hotel and I got a per diem and weekends off, so I essentially got a free trip to Japan. I had a blast, and loved it there. I wanted to come back. I was just there on the 90 day landing permission (legit, since I wasn't getting paid in Japan), and they were going to bring in a different consultant guy to replace me once my 90 days were up. I'd already written up a long FAQ for him to follow, since they hadn't given me  any  information about what to do when I arrived at Narita. His flight was scheduled to come in about 3 days or so before I left, so that I could show him around and provide a little more of a 'soft' landing for him. But I had such a good time that I got my manager's permission to come back in 90 days, once the other consultant's 90 days were up. \n IIRC the other dude was flying out to Japan from the US on a Wednesday, and I was flying out on Sunday. On Monday before my coworker flew out, I was told by the Japanese company that they weren't renewing our contract. They were going through some massive cost cutting, and ended up firing  all  of the consultants they had brought in, leaving a ton of projects unfinished. \n Of course, I wasn't coming back later that year, and the guy that was to fly out wasn't coming. So I was disappointed that I wasn't coming back, but this dude had a ticket in hand, hotel reserved, and his bags packed to come to Japan for 3 months, and then gets told within 48 hours of flying out that he isn't going. \n Ouch.": "japanlife",
            "These are all kind of rolled up into one. Japan today has many of the sexual and gender mores comparable to the US did in the 1950s. Japanese women are often treated as the 'lesser sex'. In general, they don't have the self-confidence or power in society to learn about and make their own choices about their bodies or change the rules of society to allow for that. Japan is also having serious societal issues due to their economy and aging population. The 'traditional' (since the 50s anyway) roles are that men get jobs for life, work 70+ hours a week to pay for their wife and kids, the wife takes care of the household and kids, and the parents pretty much live separate lives, but the man has his job and drinking and probably going to soaplands or whatever, and the woman has her kids and friends and probably some action on the side herself. Nowadays, men aren't getting jobs or if they are getting jobs they are lower-paying and aren't guaranteed for life. But they still want a woman who will take care of the household. And women want a man that will take care of her and the kids forever, or she wants to work and split household responsibilities, neither of which are as common nowadays. \n Abortion: It's pretty common due to lack of other birth control methods, and because of a number of other factors: single motherhood is rough here, couples have kids less often in general due to housing size, career paths, etc. Japan being a Buddhist society would have technically frowned on abortion, as Buddhism frowns on killing. According to [Wikipedia]( some Japanese women have a memorial service after an abortion or miscarriage. Abortion became widely available primarily due to the 'Zero Population Growth' movements starting after WWII, and they used Japan as their test bed- This is why abortion is very popular in India and China as well, where they often use abortion as means to select for sex. Read [Unnatural Selection]( for more on this. My own take on abortion in Japan is that it's widely available and used, but rarely or never talked about. \n Sex: I think many Japanese women (and men, in many ways) are pretty innocent/ignorant of good sex practices. They are taught the physical part of sex in school as, yes, while there's an aspect of modesty in Japanese culture (outward/public behavior), there's no religious hangups about it like there is particularly in the US. This idea of 'modesty' without real restrictions, along with treating women as the lesser sex, is why Japanese porn is censored, but they still regularly have tentacle rape or bukkake scenes, etc. Nowadays due to sex roles breaking down due to the previously mentioned societal factors, both men and women are living with their parents longer and just not having sex at all. \n Birth Control: Condoms are everywhere- you can buy them in the conbini and they are given away for free at love hotels. I've also heard many Japanese men don't want to wear them, and that Westerners are the ones that bring in all the disease (never mind the fact that some Japanese men do a ton of sex tourism to Thailand, etc). The lack of condom usage as well as lack of other methods of birth control go back to women's inability to affect change in Japanese society. On a cultural level they are unwilling to push for more options, and in a society where a (male) cabinet member fairly recently refered to women as 'baby-making machines', men don't seem to be too concerned with women's lib either.": "japan",

            "From a post I made some months ago [here]( \n >A topic that I'm intimately familiar with! Hurray! \n >Alright, so let's do a quick and dirty revision of realism. Realism has a few historical antecedents like Thucydides (The strong do what they will, the weak suffer what they must), Hobbes (particularly for his thoughts on the state of nature, particular that the state of nature encourages barbarism, and humans are inherently in conflict), and E.H. Carr for his 1938 book The Twenty Years Crisis in which he tears apart the international liberalism of the 1918-2938 period. \n >Carr argues that liberalism as envisioned by Woodrow Wilson failed because it could not stop the world from going to war in 1938. Liberalism at its core argues that people are inclined to peace and believe that peace is inherently possible. Peace can be achieved by institutions and norms etc. Except these institutions and norms failed to stop WWII. \n >So after the war, Hans Morgenthau comes along with his 1948 book Politics Among Nations. Morgenthau lays out the 6 Principles of Realism that form the foundation of the entire school of realism as we understand it today. Not to say that every point is still relevant, but they're tremendously important for context. Anyway, Morgenthau's stuff holds up for a while, primarily because it could explain the state of the international system in the post-war period. \n >In 1957, Kenneth Waltz comes along and argues that Morgenthau got some stuff right, but he also got some stuff wrong. Whereas Morgenthau emphasized the importance of human nature (I.E. Hobbesianism), Waltz preferred his structural understanding of the international system. In Man, the State, and War he argues that there are three images (or levels of analysis) in the study of war. First, he argues is the study of human nature (like Morgenthau's work), the second is that wars occur because of domestic structures. Finally, the third image is systemic. Waltz argues that structure rules all - the international system is controlled by balancing, bandwagonning, alliances etc. \n >In 1975, Waltz adds to his earlier theory by arguing that the international system is inherently anarchical, and in anarchy states are ordinated by their material capabilities (I.E. Power). \n >But oh shit! What happens in the late 1980s and early 1990s? Right, the collapse of the Soviet Union. But why is this important? Because Waltz's theory suggests that in a balanced system the Soviet Union should not have collapsed as it did. And when a theory loses predictive value, what the hell good is it anyway? \n >So the 1990s was a bit of a chaotic time for realists, because all of the sudden Waltz was sort of caught with his theoretical pants down. However, a bunch of theorists start looking back to classical realism (like Morgenthau) for guidance. Eventually, neo-classical realism comes around and it's sort of a synthesis between Structural Realism (Waltz) and Classical Realism (Morgenthau). There's a great article out there by Gideon Rose that outlines the theory cohesively, but simply put it places a premium on relative material capability within the international system. However, it includes a bunch of other ideas like perception, and willingly incorporates domestic variables. \n >Neo-classical realism is sort of still relevant, but it gets a bad rap for being 'intellectually inconsistent', which is snarky academic talk for 'you've created a theory with contradictions.\" Anyway, many still use it, but it's really only good for analyses in which material power matters. It wouldn't make much sense to use a material power analysis for a discussion of say... Mexico's role in the international system. \n >However, structural realism gave way to two related and somewhat useful realist theories. First and perhaps more famous, John Mearsheimer's Offensive Realism argues that states are power maximizers, not interested in bandwagonning or balancing. Suffice it to say, it's new-ish because Tragedy of Great Power Politics was only published in 2001. It's new... but no one really uses it? Certainly not foreign policy people in government - it's way too aggressive and would never make a popular foreign policy as whole. \n >The other sort of \"cousin\" of structural realism is Defensive Realism. Defensive realism holds that states are interested in survival like every other realist theory, except that instead of power maximization and material capability at the fore - security is the main variable. Defensive realists tend to incorporate geography, technology, offensive-defense balances, alliances, and finally a state's foreign policy can be the product of domestic considerations - not just responses to the international system. \n >Defensive realism makes a lot of sense to use when you're doing an analysis of middle power, or low-power states. I know I used it heavily for my thesis on Ballistic Missile Defense in Canada. \n >Finally, there's some work being on with social psychological approaches to inside-outside dynamics with realism. Basically, realists assume that states are antagonistic because of inherent differences. However, there's been no way to test it until recently. I need to find the paper I'm thinking about, but instead of first-image human nature theorists who use non-empirical philosophy, social psychologists are trying to do a human nature explanation using test subjects. Look up Social Identity Theory and realism, it's pretty hot. \n >So": "Ask_Politics",
            "This should be fun. To give my answers a little more context, I'm Canadian and not American, so the answer to my last question might be coloured by a slightly external viewpoint. \n >Why do you consider yourself a liberal? \n I consider myself somewhere between a classic economic liberal and a neoliberal. I love free markets and enterprise, I think it does more harm than good from a practical perspective. However, there is room for the government to act as a redistributive force for good - hence why I barely qualify as a neoliberal. \n >What disagreements (major) do you have with Libertarianism? \n Oy, this will be long, but here we go \n Libertarianism is generally ahistorical  - What I mean by this is that those who argue for pure libertarianism generally do not do so from a historicist perspective, preferring to rely on normative judgments. An example of a historicist philosophy is something like Marxism, where Marx used history to demonstrate that the proletariat has been continually subjugated by the propertied class. I'm not saying that I buy all of Marx's arguments (otherwise I would call myself a Marxist, not a Classical Liberal/Neoliberal), but I think in the absence of empirical data, historicism lends at least a little heft to philosophy. \n I believe in collective identities/rights  - What I mean is that I believe people hold rights by virtue of collective identity. For example, I /u/thornplebeian hold rights by virtue of being a Canadian citizen. I don't hold rights by virtue of being an individual separate from my collective Canadian identity. Should that identity change, the nature of my rights also change. \n One of the things I think libertarianism gets wrong (by virtue of my next point, that I hope to get to soon) is that we all posses intersecting collective identities, which are subject to different sorts of societal pressures that can impinge on certain rights we are owed as members of groups. For example, I'm Canadian, gay, white etc. I derive a sense of self from my belonging to those collectivities. Much like Marx, who never argued for the rights of individual workers and only workers as a group, I think collective identities are  critical  to understanding social behaviour. Now, libertarianism places a dramatic emphasis on individuality (and individual agency, that I'll get to shortly), and you can't reconcile libertarian philosophy on individual rights with the existence of collective identities (hello ahistoricism at work!). \n Libertarianism is too reductionist  - What I mean is that it reduces the complexity of social interaction down to the nature, wants and needs of the individual. Like I said before, collective identities exist and operate in society, therefore it makes little sense to reduce our understanding of societal rights to individual people. \n The Structure and Agency Problem  ( for reference  is that libertarianism places an emphasis on  choice . Individuals have the  choice  to behave freely, and can be expected to sink or swim at their own design. The problem is that not everyone necessarily has this choice, and they're subject to  structural  impediments that prevent them from accessing all available options to make a choice. Now, I'm not nearly as strict a structuralist as maybe a Marxist would be, but I still think that structure prevents the selection of choice (i.e. the use of agency) enough to prevent libertarianism from being an actual workable thing. Now this is where I sort of want to go off the rails and pick apart this things called \"Socialist Libertarianism\" (yes, I realize there are books on it), but for me the defining feature of socialism/marxism/communism/gramscian thought is  structure , and libertarianism completely throws out structure in the name of agency. It's like saying \"I'm a structuralist who believes in pure agency\" - What?! \n Anyway, back on the rails just in time to wrap up. Basically I think the": "PoliticalDiscussion",
            "Alright, I'll risk the potential for acrimony and endless inbox messages telling me why I'm wrong. To put this in context, I completed my graduate education in International Relations with a specific focus on American-Canadian security issues. \n Snowden's leaks run the risk of weakening American power on the international scene if we accept that power is inclusive of material (guns, warships, tanks etc) and non-material factors (influence, authority etc). The leaks pose a problem because they serve to embarrass the United States in the face of its allies and demonstrate weakness in its internal security processes in what should be some of the most secure institutions of the state. \n So Snowden managed to dent American influence among its allies (even if everyone does spy on one another, it still doesn't look good) and now states that are genuinely interested in weakening American power have cause to believe that they might be able to successfully challenge it in ways not previously possible. Essentially, it's a problem that emboldens potential enemies and makes allies less keen to back American interests. \n So why is a weakened America a problem? The United States has actually successfully maintained international peace through its existence as a world hegemon (especially if you suscribe to [Hegemonic Stability Theory]( and a strong America lends economic stability because of its immense consumer base and the fact that the USD is still the reserve currency of the world. So remember, peace through power, stability though power. These are fairly core principles of [realism]( So with the United States' non-material power weakened, it's not able to project itself as effectively as it was once able to do. \n Now, let me caveat a bunch of stuff I've just said. The damage is  proportional  - so I'm not saying 'Snowden will cause international chaos'.

My argument is simply that there is the  potential  for a decrease in non-material power - which negatively impacts the United States and its allies. \n Also, my arguments don't care about internal American politics or law. I don't care if what he did was illegal, or legal, those are inconsequential to my argument. He might be legally justified, he might be ethically/morally justified, and that's fine.

            "It's very common to critique the realist school of international relations by aiming for the normative/moralistic bone, basically because realism isn't equipped to handle those questions. So when I put my realist cap on to perform foreign policy analyses, power becomes my focus and I essentially shun questions of ethics/morals. Now, I don't view it as immoral, so much as amoral and we'll have to agree to disagree on it since I'm guessing it largely comes down to philosophical differences. My education was hugely impacted by writers like Hobbes and Machiavelli, and my research has largely focused on some pretty awful things (in moral terms). So it shouldn't be an awful surprise that I can 'switch off' concerns of morality for the purpose of doing this sort of thing. \n I guess my personal approach is that if someone wants to make ethics and morals the focus of their research, they are free to worry about those things. Morals and ethics are rarely a concern to my work. \n >might makes right\" this seems to be incomparable with any sort of human rights advocacy. \n Sort of. A lot of realists find ways to justify interventions to prevent human rights atrocities like genocide through other means. For instance, instead of arguing for intervention based on human rights violations, a realist (of most variations) might argue intervention is required to maintain regional stability and local balances of power. The human rights concerns just happen to end up as a happy by-product of maintaining the balance of power/regional stability. Also, the intervening states need some sort of interest in doing so. So if regional stability is in the interest of say, France, the French will intervene (like Mali), if it's not - they won't (like Rwanda). The protection of human rights is incidental to the larger picture. \n Now, this doesn't always happen. Rwanda, Darfur and a few other human rights abuses have gone unattended. This only reinforces the idea if no state finds it in their interests to stop genocide, they simply won't. It's terrible, but it sort of goes towards proving that the international system doesn't give two shakes about what is 'right', they care about what's in it for them. \n You might also find it interesting that I'm a gay, Canadian that subscribes to realpolitik in international affairs...

The store didn\u2019t impress him much, but he noticed that the office-supply aisle was absolutely packed with shoppers. He told the Makro executives to abandon their model and concentrate solely on office supplies; when they declined, he decided to give it a try himself. Boston business is a small world, and when he went looking for a venture-\u00adcapital partner, he eventually found his way to Mitt Romney and his new $37 million fund.  \u201cMost V.C.\u2019s thought it was ridiculous,\u201d Stemberg says. \u201cMitt was highly unusual in that he went to the research level to study it.\u201d \n > The trouble with the idea, to Romney\u2019s subordinates at Bain Capital, was that the small businesses Stemberg needed to draw weren\u2019t accustomed to visiting a store for office supplies;  they got them from separate vendors, some who \u00addelivered\u2014one supplier for pens and paper, one for printer cartridges, and so on. \u201cSome of us were worried that we needed to change consumer behavior,\u201d recalls Robert F. White, one of the firm\u2019s managing directors. Romney persisted.  As members of the group surveyed more and more small businesses in suburban Massachusetts, they discovered that if you asked a small-business manager how much he spent on office supplies, he would give you a low estimate and tell you it wasn\u2019t worth it to send someone in a car to buy them. But if you asked the bookkeepers, you got a far higher number, about five times as much\u2014high enough, Romney and Stemberg thought, to get them to come to the store.  The idea became Staples. Romney\u2019s Bain Capital colleagues were soon helping to select a cheaper, more efficient computer system for the first store; they were helping stock the shelves themselves. As Staples succeeded, and began to expand, they looked at analytics for everything \u2014the small-business population around a proposed store site, traffic flow\u2014and gamed out exactly how big a customer would need to be before it demanded delivery.

Around the same time came the telegraph and telephone (which was chosen over the fiber optic photophone device that he was working on needed fiberoptic lines to work and fiberoptics hadn't been invented.) Then came the fax machine (Wikki diploma says that was a guy at RCA for modern version in the 20s, but a guy in 1850s for original), which I argue, for all intensive purpose, the fax was the first internet... but I will be happy to concede it was not as close as the ARPANET... \n The guy who \"created\" the internet didn't create the concept of electric transferal of information across vast distance using telephone lines... that was called a \"Fax\".

He didn't create the electricity required to run all of that shit either... \n In fact, when you think on it... that shitty 16K modem isn't even comparable to the DSL of today... If you insist on calling that an internet, then surely you can call fax machines \"the internet\" as well. \n I agree, I am no expert. I'm sure there are many factual steps in the evolution process of the internet that I have missed... but surely the overwhelming components that led to this great \"Internet\" invention were not funded by government research in any way.

I'm saying Romney's  actual  quote was rather bland (and not even his opinion, but the opinion of an author he was talking about.) Here is a transcript of the portion of the speech in question: \n >\u201cI was thinking this morning as I prepared to come into this room of a discussion I had across the country in the United States about my perceptions about differences between countries. And as you come here and you see the GDP per capita for instance in Israel, which is about 21,000 dollars, and you compare that with the GDP per capita just across the areas managed by the Palestinian Authority which is more like 10,000 dollars per capita, you notice a dramatic, stark difference in economic vitality. And that is also between other countries that are near or next to each other. Chile and Ecuador, Mexico and the United States.\" \n >\"I noted that part of my interest when I used to be in the world of business is I would travel to different countries was to understand why there were such enormous disparities in the economic success of various countries. I read a number of books on the topic. One, that is widely acclaimed, is by someone named Jared Diamond called \u2018Guns, Germs and Steel,\u2019 which basically says the physical characteristics of the land account for the differences in the success of the people that live there. There is iron ore on the land and so forth. And you look at Israel and you say you have a hard time suggesting that all of the natural resources on the land could account for all the accomplishment of the people here. And likewise, other nations that are next door to each other have very similar, in some cases, geographic elements.\" \n >\"But then there was a book written by a former Harvard professor named \u2018The Wealth and Poverty of Nations.\u2019 And in this book Dr. Landes describes differences that have existed -- particularly among the great civilizations that grew and why they grew and why they became great and those that declined and why they declined. And after about 500 pages of this lifelong analysis -- this had been his study for his entire life -- and he\u2019s in his early 70s at this point, he says this, he says, if you could learn anything from the economic history of the world it\u2019s this: Culture makes all the difference. Culture makes all the difference. And as I come here and I look out over this city and consider the accomplishments of the people of this nation, I recognize the power of at least culture and a few other things.\" \n While I agree, Romney is saying that Israeli Culture is responsible for Israeli success, he is NOT giving any insults to The Palestinians in any direct way.

            "So, I would characterize the evolution of Donald Trump coverage as; \n 1) First they laughed at him... as we all did. The constant rubber-necking back up in the media, as they all filled their papers and screens with images of and opinions on the trainwreck in action, was a spectacle in and of itself! And everyone was having fun making fun of Donald and the Republicans. \n 2) Then they supported him - [Over the course of the campaign (up to march), he has earned close to $2 billion worth of media attention, about twice the all-in price of the most expensive presidential campaigns in history.  ]( \n I argue this is intentional. In my life experience, it seems to me the media supported Romney, McCain and Bush in a similar \"free media\" way, although I admit I don't have a link like the NYT one above! The difference here is certainly stark. None of them were aided that much by the media. Intentional or unintentional results of mocking - the result is 2 campaigns worth of coverage for one guy... for free. \n 3) The Clinch. In the past, once the nomination was clinched, the media then turns on the chosen republican. I saw it the most with Bush, constantly printing pictures of him with his eye half closed and his mouth open... as if that was the only photo their digital camera captured... But it was the same for McCain, who went from hero to dottering old fool... and Romeny, who went from Businessman to Mr. Monopoly's Evil Cousin Captain Vulture... \n And the question is - will this post-clinch coverage backfire or work with The Donald? What skeletons will come out of the closet? Afterall... how do you make him look bad? Donald is the king of \"I'm Rubber, You're Glue\" slinging. \n I make no bones about being a #NeverTrump republican. I've said it often for the last year, and continue to want to vote 3rd party now that it is clear Trump is the GOP canidate. \n I do have to say that Trump reminds me of Obama in one specific way; The more you try to make fun of him or claim he is incompetent or doesn't deserve it... the more people like him. \n I think that same thing happened with Bush in a lot of ways too, that many still liked him and even liked him more when he was attacked - but the tide turned on him after the market crash. \n What I think political media coverage should be about: (But probably won't be.) \n Trump has a very specific mathematical equation to overcome in the General: \n The GOP can't afford to lose any votes. And they most certainly will lose many of the NeverTrump republicans (Like me). \n The only way to offset that loss is to pull from the 94 million people that didn't bother to vote in 2012. \n 60 million voted Romney. \n So say Trump loses 10% of that 60 million - people like me. \n All he needs is to pull 6.5% of that 94 million that didn't vote to make up for the lost #NeverTrump vote. \n If he pulls 10% from that \"We Dont Vote\" block he would probably win it all! \n People who claim that there will be some flood of Bernie supporters supporting Trump are out of their fucking minds.

            "As a sophomore in highschool we watched the movie version of this story.  It was low budget and my friend and I were pretty fascinated with it wondering if it could actually happen.  What I am about to say is pretty unbelievable to me looking back on it, but these things get out of control really really fast. \n Just a few weeks after watching this film my friend and I were off to be outdoor school counselors.  This third guy who would wear black trenchcoats and went by the name Neo even though his name was Neil was a counselor we met and befriended.  While that short lived trend of Matrix kids was always strange to me Neo won me over with his opening line, \"My parents had raised me with the promise that one day George Lucas would would make more star wars movies, that is why it starts with 4. When I went to the theater and saw episode one I felt how Jerry Falwell would feel if in the second coming Jesus was black.\" \nThis was the kind of politically incorrect thinking I could get behind.  So my friend and I started talking to Neo about all kinds of things.  Eventually the Wave came up.  My friend and I had joked about what it would be like to do that in the camp, but this was one of the many random hypothetical's we did all the time.  Neo however thought this idea was fantastic.  He latched onto it instantly and said we had to do it.\nAfter having a conversation where we kind of said we were going to do it we all went off to run our cabins or teach our activities or something. This was back in like 2002 and I don't remember the timeline exactly, but I can tell you that Neo got his whole cabin to draw little waves on the back of their nametags and start doing the wave sign.  I think I remained pretty removed from the entire thing, but like the teachers account says it is hard to remember.  Your brain really doesn't want to let you think of yourself as an instigator to something as powerful as this kind of fascist energy.\nOn the first day one of the creepiest images in my psyche is remembering Neo with a kid looking at me from accross the field.  He pointed at me and did the wave, and then the 6th grader did the wave, and I did it back with this thought in my mind like what the hell are we doing.\nSo I knew a couple kids had started doing the wave to eachother, and that Neo had told them that my friend and I both were also part of the wave.  One of the kids I had in my soil class had a wave on the back of his name tag and when the other kids were finding bugs, one of the activities part of the soil program, he started talking really fast to me about it.  He was super excited.  He wanted to see the back of my nametag and see if I had a wave.  I didn't, but put one on in front of him.  We talked a little and you could tell he was super happy to have an upper hand connection with the student running his activity.\nThe kids started spreading the wave around and it was incredible how fast it grew.  I never indoctrinated anyone or really did anything but just because through the grapevine people had heard I was part of it I was getting extra respect from kids that were not in my cabin and these kids would come and talk to me about the wave.\nWe didn't do many of the disciplinary things expressed in the original, just a little sense of hierarchy and prestige was all it took.  It was just the desire to belong to something and the idea that they were that gave us extra authority.  I think it was during this second day that one of the campers in my cabin came up to me and told me he was now part of the wave.  He was trying to convince the other campers in our bunk that they should join. \nI kind of asked him questions like why do you want to be in the wave?\nWhat do you think the point of the wave is?\nAnd he said you are in it, its cool come on.  And vague little bursts of excitement.  This kid just loved the idea of being in something secret and something that meant he belonged.  If memory serves there were kids from a few different elementary schools there, so this was a way for them to co-mingle with the kids from other schools.  It was the next morning that things started getting more out of control.\nKids started running up and flipping peoples name tags yelling your not in the wave your not in the wave.  The camp started to become aware that something was going on.  Wave kids were downright mean to non wave kids at times, and on top of that, they stopped listening or respecting the non wave highschool counselors or adults. \n The main counselor who oversaw us came and pulled Neo my friend and I out and talked to us about the wave.  He seperated Neo off because I think most of the kids had said he was the leader of it, but talked to my friend and I as well.  He said that a kid had refused to do what he told him to because he only listened to other Wave members.  The guy started asking us about what the hell was going on. \n We just kind of told him, and downplayed our involvement, in a way throwing Neo under the bus.  In another way I think we really were far more cursory than him.  The head counselor basically told us that we had to end it and that he was going to write about it in our files but we didn't get in any serious trouble.  He made us feel really guiltiy, \"outdoor school is going to be cut, and the last thing we need is a story like this giving them a reason to cut it.\"  We felt terrible, but the thing was that with very little effort, even from Neo, this thing took a life of its own. \n It wasn't that hard to end it.  We just told the kids that excluding people is bad, we neither had the capability or the escalation to warrant the kind of breakdown that happened in the school that did it.  It just kind of sits as some weird half memory that I ask myself how the hell did that happen?\nThe point is that if you can make people feel a sense of community and connectedness through giving them something special like a reward, it can be a very powerful tool.

In this process which started in the late 80's and picked up through the 90's Icelandic wealth shot up FAST.  The country had unprecedented growth.

The money that was being poured into their banks was coming from all over Europe. \n Where in the United States bailing out wall street, helped the banking industry, it also helped every business that had things invested in that industry.  These industries lobbied and fought to save their skin, because the downfall of wallstreet would have hurt them significantly, it wasn't just the banks.  In Iceland all these businesses that would be effected were external to the country.  They would have been essentially been bailing out their banking industry for the sake of Europe, not Iceland.  When they let their banks fail, it pissed off the international community, and hurt their economy in the short term extremely, but they would recover faster because they essentially didn't bail out a bunch of oversees business.

The last time the left was truly united was under FDR, there have been some ups, but overall the last 70 years has been a gradual disintegration of the FDR coalition.  Just looking at the kinds of people FDR had for vice president, Wallace was debatably Buddhist, and clearly very leftest in ideology.  In fact he was attacked for being to extreme which led FDR to choose a new vice president in his last campaign where the safer choice was either Truman (a moderate anti corruption figure) or Justice Douglas, who proved to be one of the supreme court justices furthest to the left. \n The democratic party at the time included socialists communists, blacks, southerners, populists, the poor, and new money.  This coalition broke down, the southern dixiecrats left first, and by 1992 the very few of these factions were still supported.\nWhy was this?  Well to understand that I say we look at how the Republican party became the fairly disciplined and unified party they have been until fairly recently.  They talked about ideology.  Before Reagan you had the social conservatives duking it out with the libertarians.  Reagan layed out and preached how he thought the economy should work, how he thought society should work, and it wasn't that people necessarily agreed with it, it was that over time hearing it they became indoctrinated. The ideas Reagan layed out for how government should work did not meet the reality of his policies, it didn't matter, it did not match the thinking of most republicans at the time, but it did by the end of his term.  He unified the factioned republican party by giving an explanation however flawed of how things worked, and the people listened and we today still talk about economics, deficits, and military under his shadow.  Times have changed, but noone has given the American people a new ideology. \n Meanwhile democrats have played the party of not them, of being distinctly non ideological, in order to try and keep their fractured alliance together.  It doesn't work.  I think Obama had a chance to do this, to lay out a new leftest ideology.  He has instead opted to be a political pragmatist, and has done a good job at getting difficult changes through.\nWhile these policy goals are great, the media, the public, and the left are all disappointed because they still have their seperate ideologies and the democrats are still talking under a Reagan based framework, where the default position they pragmatically explain away from is that of trickle down economics, and the idea that government is bad.\nDeep Water Horizon was a chance to preach and convert people to the merits of environmental regulation, the dangers of further dependence on oil.  Instead it managed to be a blip that seems to have changed politics less than the much smaller event in Alaska about 2 decades prior.  That is a failure to promote a message. \n I know any of you dilligent enough to read this far are thinking, isn't that the point? Isn't that why we need this, we need a coherent message?

It wasn't the christian right and the libertarians who decided to settle their differences.  It is a top down change, we need to start having democrats willing to lay out a new paradigm for how the economy, jobs, and government work.  For what role we as citizens should have in society and what role government should have in our lives.  Until someone can stand up and confidently deliver that message, until we can create a new paradigm the coalitions can't meld.  Because every side has their own policy motivators their own pet issues, and it takes an overarching picture for how things work that will unite us.

            "I don't think that 'fair share' should be the way we even look at this issue.  I think what we want to do is figure out what world we want to live in, and then after you determine that you determine what tax structure best gets you there. \n I think that in the US, the world most people want is a meritocracy where people can rise to the top and benefit from the fruits of their labor.  This ensures that the public is given an efficient market with lots of options and technological progress. \n Within this premise there is a balance.  You need to have a working meritocracy, which means that you need people with good ideas from all walks of life to have a reasonably similar chance of getting those ideas to market.  This requires education, it requires a judicial system fair enough for people to trust it rather than looking for self help or just getting screwed over, it requires not having completely impoverished families that do not expose or teach their children fundamental life skills, it requires multi-cultural and cross economic lines to be blurred, it requires a marketplace where ideas are free to come in. \n In order to deal with these issues: \n \n We have public education, which drastically underperforms and basiclaly sucks \n \n We have a court system with very little accessibility for the poor because of high costs to use the system. \n \n We have huge amounts of the population who are raised so separated from the social norms of our society that they have no hope of succeeding within it. \n \n The other side of the previous point is that we do not have the level of multiculturalism and economic understanding to be able to create a society that effectively accepts people of different backgrounds into new categories. \n \n We have anti trust laws and at times zoning interference to try to keep local businesses and small businesses competitive, but we also have tons of laws which make it incredibly easy for giant companies to completely capture and control markets.  This makes a marketplace where the ideas we are trying to create never are seen and can never come to life, because economies of scale and militant business practices crush, destroy, or purchase competition instead of competing with it. \n \n \n So what does all this mean?  It means that we have failed to create the meritocracy that was our stated goal.  I don't think their is a 'fair share' that the 1% should pay, but I do think that under the current system we are not achieving the goals we set out to achieve in society.  This calls for more than just tax reform, but if we can live in a society where we are more competitive and better, we can make the pie bigger.  This is the argument behind free trade and reagonomics, but it also works the other way.  When we make the pool of people and ideas that can succeed very small because of wealth advantages (the amount of people that move between quintiles of the economy from where they were raised is remarkably low in comparison to other countries), because we instead create an aristocracy of options.  This is not competitive in the global market, and it creates worse lives for most people domestically. \n I think the amount that would be 'fair' or that this top % should be paying is completely contingent on where we are with these other goals.  In the end I don't think the thing holding back the economy currently is multi-millionaires not thinking it is worth that extra time and effort to become billionaires...  I think that they have proven they are willing to go to great lengths to do this.  That motivation is just fine, the problem is that their are to many people in the bottom three quintiles, the bottom 60% that see no hope in success and are not willing to try.  If we can create more realistic and achievable economic incentives for those people, and we can all be richer, except maybe that very top 5% you need to tax heavily to get there.  However even they get to live in a more prosperous desirable place which would likely have less crime, less homeless people, and that would be more welcoming to them.": "PoliticalDiscussion"

Does that mean it'd be as fast as SHA on a GPU? Probably not. \n I guess my point is that while using an intentionally slow algorithm may buy a little time, system administrators need to stay on top of the security of their systems so that they can quickly identify intrusions, and follow procedures to remedy the problem, force everyone to change their passwords, and notify users of the intrusion when and where appropriate. As an application developer, providing the widest array of reasonable options and ways for sysadmins to easily switch between them is probably the best thing you can do. (so having your application support both bcrypt  and  pbkdf2, where possible, is a good thing. let the sysadmin choose what's best for their needs) \n I'm not a security expert, so I can't speak to exactly how secure one is over the other. Both methods are \"secure enough\" and as far as I know, neither Bcrypt nor pbkdf2:SHA2 (sha256, sha512, etc.) have any \"short-circuit\" hacks published yet. \n I only suggest pbkdf2 via werkzeug because werkzeug is a dependency of Flask, so it's already present in a Flask environment, and it's really simple to use. \n If you supply a higher iteration count in the  method=  argument (e.g.,  method=\"pbkdf2:sha256:10000\"  which is 10x the default number of iterations) it will make calculating each hash take longer in a bruteforce situation.": "flask",

Each character has a pronunciation that fits Japanese syllables/morae, and some characters have the same pronunciation as others.

            "Let us assume that a release is some form of agreement between the developers and her users. Usually a release indicates that: \n \n The releasable version is considered in a certain state. A state that can be communicated with the users (stable, beta, alpha, security-fix etceteras).  \n The release indicates an immutable point in time and development. Even twenty years from now, you can rewind to release XYZ and find it in the exact same state. \n A release is typically kept forever. Unless, off course, the entire project is removed, that release will exist, with the exactly predictable (and often documented) bugs, shortcomings and other incompatibilities. In most complex software projects (and your Drupal-core + 30 contribs is such a project) you will always choose predictability over newness. \n A release often runs trough test-cycles. This will be stated in the projects documentation. Most often trough simple \"we are beta, please install and report back\", but sometimes trough entire <a href=\" Integration</a> cycles.  \n Documentation, Readme's, third-party dependencies are most often developed parallel. A release is a point where they are all brought together and synchronised.  \n \n This can, indeed, easily mean that a -dev version has less bugs then a release. In most situations that is very logical: you make a release. It contains 6 bugs, 3 are solved, not enough for a new release. Now the -dev release contains 3 bugs and the released version 6. To many people this is an indication that the -dev release is \"better\" then the released version.\nDev versions may (and often are) be end of line versions. I have, for example, worked on a fully OOP, for users entirely backwards compatible, replacement for Tagadelic. (It is on hold, mostly due to my lessening Drupal involvement). If it is released, there will be an upgrade path from the various releases to the new version. But not from each and every nightly-build -dev. This is part of that \"agreement\". \nDev versions might stop working from one day to another. Often large refactorings mean that features have to pulled out for a few commits, or that entire subsets stop working. A rewrite will break compatibility with other modules for a while, at least. So even if it works now, you simply never know if it will tomorrow. \nDev versions are aimed at developers. So all the nice tools to lower the barrier for the larger public, such as installers, integration, end-users documentation and so on, are often neglected during this period. \"It does not work -what does not work? -it shows nothing on the installer? -what does the debug-log show you? -the what, I don't know how to look at the log\". Such tickets and emails are all too common and are utter time-wasters. If you don't know how to read and debug code, then a -dev version, being for developers, is not for you. You may try it, but certainly should not expect a smooth ride. And definately not consume precious developers-time by filing already known- or duplicate bugs :). \n A few more practical reasons not to use -dev versions are: \n \n You have not pinned a point in time and development: there is nothing more time-consuming and infuriating then attempting to find the exact time and date for some arbitrary -dev module in some arbritrary three year old Drupalsite that is handed to you. \n You cannot be certain of proper database updates. They are (or should be) guaranteed between releases, but not between -dev versions. chances are that some untested database change between -dev versions spoils your entire database. And if it can happen, it will happen. \n The state is uncertain: whereas a release has known issues and bugs, a -dev version is in a state of brokenness (or else it could be a release, now, shouldn't it?) which is entirely unknown. Installing a -dev version is a little like trial-and-error debugging and coding: it might get you a working environment. But if you have no idea why it works, you are probably worse off then when you had a none-working environment but knew exactly why it did not work. \n The userbase is small and spread out very thin. There is only one Latest Release, making it the most used version. But there are new -dev version rolled out every night, making the amount of users who run the exact same version as you, very small. This fact, is actually the whole concept behind the \"agreement-thing\".": "drupal",

            "RAID5 is \"fine\", but I'd avoid it. Mirroring is much easier to deal with (and recover from, if the RAID decides to \"fail\"). That being said, consider your disaster recovery plan (backup/restore). \n Your / partition is quite large, you can use a smaller one and have the SSD open for more later. Look at your current system usage, account for some growth, and plan from there. Growing a filesystem is fairly simple-- the most complicated part is it usually can't be done while the partition is in use. Having more room means you can create another partition and test out btrfs, some other filesystem, or just have a completely different system available. Keep in mind /var/tmp was designed to be a bit more persistant than /tmp, but if tmpfs works fine, nothing's wrong with that. \n I'd keep the separate volumes, like you were planning. I remember playing around with new file-systems on /, where they decide that they don't want to mount. Having a separate stable /boot saved me headaches. Maybe if you want to trust one file-system for everything and never change, one partition would be \"better\". \n I see you have discard on the SSD (which is good). I'd consider moving from noatime to relatime (irrc, its a default now) \n Stick with what you know: I trust ext3/ext4 a lot more than XFS (from experience on my desktops/laptops, rather than servers-- my servers have a very different environment and use case than my desktop and laptop). If you want to test out XFS, test it out on some unimportant volume, like /usr/portage and /usr/portage/distfiles. \n LVM isn't going to make anything more efficient. LVM does make everything more flexible. You can resize and move volumes on the fly (partitions don't resize very well, while in use). I didn't use it in my setups, because of the more complicated boots at the time. I use it all the time several servers and love the flexibility it offers. If I could set everything up on LVM, easily, I would. \n With Gentoo: unless you're experiencing some sort of problem with leftover files, some other broken brokenness, or just wanting to clear out your world file: I wouldn't bother with a re-install.

            "Here's the dirty little secret about REST APIs - most of the time if someone says they have a REST API, they don't. They are a REST-like API or RPC servers. \n Real REST APIs \n In a real REST API,  you have a resource and you do things to it via HTTP verbs. This means GETing a resource to view it, PUTing a resource to update/create it, DELETEing a resource, and POSTing to collections to create new resources. If you use one verb to do multiple jobs, you don't have a rest server. REST APIs also make heavy use of the headers for content negotiation, so if you have to pass that you want XML back in the query string, you aren't using a fully RESTful API. \n REST-Like APIs* \nTake Twitter. If you are using real REST, you wouldn't specify your output via the URL query, that's a job for the headers in your request. You would also make use of all of the verbs, not just GET and POST. \n Does the URI have an action in the name (statuses/destroy/:id is one example)? Most like it isn't a REST API. \n Do you use POST for more than creating information? Again, statuses/destroy/:id uses POST, but this would actually be handled by a DELETE verb in a real REST architecture. If you wanted to get a tweet, the endpoint would be GET /statuses/:id, not GET /statuses/show/:id. To add a tweet, you would POST /statuses, not POST /statuses/update. \n This is a valid set of REST endpoints (which are not all valid Twitter endpoints): \n GET /statuses\nPOST /statuses\nDELETE /statuses/:id\nGET /user_timeline\n \n These are not: \n POST /direct_messages/destroy/:id\nGET /friends/ids\nPOST /friendships/create\n \n RPC-Servers \n Many other APIs that call themselves REST are actually RPC servers. This is a modification of the normal XML-RPC server, where you send a block of XML to a single endpoint which contains a method and parameters. REST API's that tend to be like RPC servers have endpoints that look like function names, but only ever support POST. \n Flickr is somewhat guilty of this, having endpoints like 'flickr.groups.discuss.replies.delete', which take a POST command and arguments in the URL. If the endpoints are basically names of functions, and everything else is passed via the query string, you have an RPC server masquerading as a REST API. \n The Web As a REST API \n In a basic sense, the web browser and web server act as a REST client and server, respectively. You issue GET commands for resources, and they are returned to you. The browser and the server negotiate the content type via the headers. You just never see that. Where is starts to break down is when sites return bad HTTP responses for things, like 200 for failed logins, or not supporting DELETE for PUT. The web itself, when looked at from a browser/server point of view, is REST-like, but not actually REST.": "webdev",

We used CentOS so the Apache version number was behind, but Red Hat back ports security patches so we were actually OK. \n We did whitelist them in OSSEC so they could perform the web app tests.

You don't need to persuade them that PHP is awesome because Facebook, Wikipedia, NASA, the government uses it... you need to persuade them PHP is the answer because of the money involved. \n > trying to get rid of a lot of mission-critical software I've written in PHP \n Determine the cost to rewrite this software. Include licensing (assuming it's something like .NET or Oracle), new hardware, developer training, etc. Mission Critical software is very hard to replicate because that sort of stuff needs to be 100% the same when you replace it. 80% isn't good enough, and to get to 100% you need to also re-introduce the bugs that are there. \n At my old job we had a system that priced insurance for a particular line, and we needed to get it online. At the time we couldn't get our back-end system to do the work directly, so we rebuilt it in PHP. It was consistently $1-2 off, no matter how many people we had look at it. Our math by hand was also off. Know why? Because at some point someone accidentally got the rounding procedure off in the back-end system, and the back-end system is always correct. If we fixed the back-end system it would result in thousands of lost dollars. That's the kind of stuff you have to replicate, not fix. (We ended up changing the documented math procedure, btw). \n To do this kind of stuff takes time, money, and man-power. Figure out this cost and present it as why you would switch. Make sure to take into account maintenance costs in the long run, as you want to be able to counter the inevitable, \"But if we spend money now on .NET, it will be cheaper in the long run!\" \n > Management here (as with most places) consists of the blind leading the blind.

I'd even argue that most companies handle test plan management poorly. \n I've read two testing books recently that discuss this in a way that I find palatable and sensible: \n In both books, the authors argue that it's better to create high level test summariesstrategies than fully expanded and granular lists of EVERY SINGLE test case. \n I completely agree with this sentiment, however the problem I have with Explore It is that the author proposes the term \"Test Charter\" for this type of test plan.  I don't like how that sounds personally and I'm both hesitant and skeptical about adding new QA-specific lingo into the mix.  I.e. using new terms to describe testing to others (non-testers).  I am not a fan of the terms Exploratory Testing and Context Driven Testing.  I also have a problem with the whole testing vs. checking debate brought on by Michael Bolton and James Bach. \n Overall, I like the Explore It book much more than the Google one - I found the Google book to be lacking in details about the \"magic\" of Google's testing processes. . . also, it should be noted that James Whitaker left Google (for Microsoft!) a few months after that book was published. . . \n Anyway, the core problem is that no one wants to sit through a review of a gigantic spreadsheet, or whatever tabular format that you are almost guaranteed to be using.  It's incredibly boring. \n Furthermore, you will have a very difficult time getting a developer to review a test plan that looks like this.  Visually scanning a long list of test cases is anathema to most developers, trust me, I've been there and done it.  This is entirely bad either, any good developer naturally despises repetition and inefficiencies.  Which is the problem here, reviewing a long list of test cases isn't an efficient group activity. \n Also, the tool/format matters a lot too.

I came from a Windows background earlier in my career but have been working with various Linux/Unix OSes for a while now.  To be perfectly honest, I'd have no problem never using Windows again, but alas it is a platform I need to test with.  :) \n Anyway, I'm in the process of writing a test tool that can run arbitrary commands on remote hosts.  I need this tool to be fully cross-platform i.e. the client and server must be able to run on Linux and Windows (OSX would be a nice to have for the client side too). \n This tool is only going to be used internally but I would like to use SSL or SSH if it's  feasible.

For lots of reasons.  I'm currently thinking that running an SSH server might be the best way to go for a few reasons: \n \n It's secure (more secure than clear text at least). \n It allows for remote commands to be run under different user accounts.  This circumvents other options that would involve a main process spawning subprocesses with other user credentials - which is ANOTHER big pain on Windows (runas is no sudo!). \n Most SSH servers install a Windows service so it's guaranteed to run after reboots. \n There are plenty of excellent SSH client tools/libraries available. \n SSH tunneling is an option and something I might want to use, specifically with this (library)[ \n \n However, SSH really isn't native to Windows and I've had problems with OpenSSH in the past (on Windows) - I hit permissions issues.  It's also a bit confusing adding SSH into a Windows environment. . . it's deceptive because it looks and feels Unix-y but Windows handles processes in a completely different way than Unix. \n My sysadmin friend recommended going with something like ZeroMQ for the RPC/messaging because it would be the least flaky cross platform option.

I told her that I felt we didn't have a healthy relationship. \n Her response was simple, \"Can we talk about this when I get back on Friday\". I said no, I see no reason to not speak about it now. I was actually a bit mad at her for not wanting to talk to me. I felt she owed me that since part of why I was upset was her not talking to me. She repeated that she wanted to talk on Friday. I insisted we speak now, and then she told me that while she was away she'd had time to think and that she believed she was no longer in love with me. \n Naturally I lost it and started crying. I asked her if there was another (I fear being cheated on greatly), and she assured there is not.

She told me that she didn't feel our lives are on the same track any more and that she has had doubts about us for a couple of months. \n The time apart made her realize that being alone was no longer a bad thing and her love to me had faded from that of a lover to that of a best friend.

Her career requires devotion and she needs to do this by herself, I no longer have a part to play in her life. \n I asked her if she believed we could talk this out, ride out the storm. She said she didn't think so and was quite sure about this. We spoke and cried with each other for another hour, I asked her about her feelings and how long she has felt this way. She told me that she felt bad for feeling this way but that she couldn't control it, that she was sad that she made me hurt. She told me the importance I have played in her life and that she cares about me deeply even now and that she will be ever thankful for the role I have played in her life. \n We hung up and I went to the pub because I needed to clear my head. I ordered a Guinness but after a few sips I realized there where no answers at the bottom of the glass this time (yay me!). I left my pint half full and met up with a friend, we ate ice cream and talked for a few hours. After this I called my ex again and spoke for another hour, I felt I needed to ask some more questions levelheaded. \n During this hour I realized that a lot of the feelings where mutual, I have also had similar thoughts in the past. Periods in our life where I saw the gap between us, but I was not ready to face it (I'm still not ready). Instead I carried on and didn't say a thing, believing that time would fix it. I told her this and she seemed happy I shared these feelings. I want someone in my life but I realize it can't be her. I have been to afraid to let go before but now I see this has to happen. \n The amount of strength required by her to come to this realization must have been phenomenal. Imagine having to distance yourself from the closest person in your life, because there is nothing left for you as a couple. She must have felt so torn and confused. I lack that strength but I thank her for summoning it, since we needed it. No one would be happy in the long run if we didn't break up. \n I write this with a lump in my throat, not because I feel cheated or mad. But because I look back at our life together fondly and realize that we have done enough for each other and there is nothing good left for us together. This chapter has ended, and like a good book it has left a void that for now is occupied by sorrow. Time will change that, I will met some one else, some one that I can love and be devout to, not by need but by choice. \n I can honestly say that the last four years have been the best in my life. I have learned so much about my self and about love. But now it is time for me to learn more about the man I have become. I am not angry with her, nor do I feel she has done something wrong. A weight has lifted from me that I did not know I carried. \n Being a practical man I already spoke to her about our home (she wants me to keep it, since she can't afford it and I can) and we have decided to met on Saturday to discuss other finances and such matters. Neither of us have any grudges and we know pretty well how our possessions are divided so this will not be difficult (always get a premarital settlement). \n The part that breaks my heart is what I will have to do with our cats. She will not be able to take them since she will move in to a small apartment and I don't think I can give them enough attention to keep them happy. So what should I do with my cats? She said she will take care of finding them a home, but how do I know it is a good home?": "relationships",

            "I am making an academic distinction, however OP inquired about JS academically so it is highly relevant. \n There is actually at least one major practical point. By design functional languages are side effect free (e.g. Haskell) or at the very least force the use of a keyword to introduce global state (F#). There are certain constructs (monads) that allow even pure functional languages to modify some state (e.g. IO), but that is another topic. \n JavaScript lacks the ability to prevent global state. That is to say prevent a function from reading and writing variables other than it's parameters. This means that a JS function is not guaranteed to behave the same way every time it is executed with the same parameters. In practice this forces a maintainer to read all methods in a module to figure out how any global state is created and modified. In ES 5 we have \"use strict\" which at least can tell us a module with no declared state variables won't declare any new ones in run time. \n Granted, you certainly can write good functional code is JS. You are forced to adopt convention and if you are restricted to ES 3 (i.e. most enterprise solutions) don't have the safety of \"use strict\". This means as a maintainer of JS written in a functional paradigm you don't have the luxury as you would if you'd maintain a Haskell code base.": "learnjavascript"

That would be cool if you like your stack to be \"turtles all the way down\".  Unfortunately that approach really isn't practical anymore given the state of the industry.  That said, I have seen another example of that in the [Oberon operating system]( and, if you want to take the old cliche joke more seriously, in emacs for users that do everything in emacs; though it is a different experience and more limited than Genera. \n Genera had design shortcomings around concurrency and apparently so did Oberon; I guess emacs may be the exception there, but only because it's normally hosted on a multi-user OS.  I don't know why there was such a design focus on single-user systems.  It seems like such a limited approach to me.  I would guess that partially is because of the \"turtles all the way down\" approach.  If you're using an OS that let's you dynamically modify code for any part of it all the way down, then suddenly you really have some deep concurrency issues.  I guess it was easier to just not deal with it and keep the extreme flexibility instead. \n I would definitely read the whole Wikipedia article and its citations.  You can apparently also go download Genera and try it for yourself, but I suspect you'll find that to be a somewhat empty experience without the ecosystem and community that went around it at its peak.": "lisp",

I don't really understand the implications of the CORS enablement and its browser support. If you can think of any other considerations I may need to think about for loading non-origin content or good advice I'd love to hear it, I'm not that experienced in webdev. \n Thank you for your help and advice :)": "webdev"

(Standard company practice). He insisted that I did the job for him. I argued that if his home printer ran out of ink, he would just get a new cartridge, instead of calling the computer shop to change it for him. \n Fast forward a couple of hours. We meet in the weekly supervisor's meeting and he tells me that he changed the toner, but still the printer is printing white on white. He also told me that it was rather difficult to fit the toner cartridge in the printer. \n Alarm bells started to ring in my head \n After the meeting, I went with him to his office to check upon the printer. Opening the toner flap revealed that my initial fear of him installing the wrong type of cartridge was unreasonable, since it was the right type. \nHis second statement, the one that it was difficult to insert the cartridge still confused me. So, I pulled (rather wedged) the cartridge out and much to my surprise the orange tab which was connected to the sealing foil of the toner compartment, AND WHICH SHOULD HAVE BEEN PULLED BEFORE INSTALLING THE TONER was still there. \nPulled the tab, took out the sealing foil, inserted the cartridge which went in smoothly, printed a test page and everything worked. \n The look on his face (especially after our previous argument about his PC qualifications) was absolutely priceless. What made him look even worse was his later statement that he had actually read the instructions, but wasn't sure where to find the orange tab.

As usual, with annoying co-workers, the re-installation took considerably longer than it would normally take (this was officially accepted by our \"Head of Maintenance\" (HoM), our immediate superior. His stand on that was, that if one screwed up more-or-less deliberately, he would have to feel it, by waiting longer for the repairs). \n So, CMPG kept asking and arguing when his \"vital\" PC was going to be ready. (Which, in turn, made him wait even longer. Second step approved by HoM. You nag - you wait.) \n Any \"normal\" person would have given in at that point and just waited until we returned the PC. But not CMPG. He decided to go to the highest in the Field, the \"Area Superintendent\" (AS). The AS was not a really tech-savvy person, so he trusted in (nearly) everybody's judgement. CMPG nagged to and complained at AS that we are working too slow and that he could not do his job (he could, btw, since he had 2 other PCs in his office), neglecting to tell AS that HE screwed up in the first place. So, AS called us and tried to rip us a second one. AS was quite puzzled to hear the full story and supporting our system, he basically told CMPG to shove it and wait (including a lengthy lecture of what CMPGs responsibilities in respect to company IT were). \n So, finally, we re-installed his PC. (Which also was quite some challenge as there were few drivers available, and at that point we didn't have direct internet access. We had to travel to an internet cafe some 40km away.) We scheduled the delivery for the morning of the day after we had finished the installation. Morning normally means that sometime after 8AM we would ship. (Before 8AM we all were busy scheduling the duties for the team for the day and doing the daily report with HoM) You'd guess that this was not good enough for CMPG and he showed up at 7AM straight when we opened our shop and office. He insisted on taking the PC with him and hooking it up by himself. I instantly told him that he had to be extremely careful with the voltage setting on the PSU (it was an old style PSU where you had to select between 120 and 220V), since in our offices both, 120V (single phase) and 220V (phase-to-phase) were available and routed. Initially it was easy to distinguish the Voltage level because the 120V net used the square-pin, english style sockets and plugs, whereas the 220V net used the round-pin type. Unfortunately, due to lack of supplies and extremely long re-ordering cycles, the sockets were mixed and the 220V new was also using the square-pin type. (Our course of action was usually to switch the PSUs to 220V, connect and fire up. If the PC would start - OK, if not, we'd switch to 120V and repeat) I reminded him 2 times to check before connecting - luckily this was witnessed by my whole team. \n CMPG trundles of with his PC under the arm and we start planning for the day. Less than 10 minutes later, we get a phone call. Guess who: CMPG. He had hooked up the PC, started it and all he heard was a loud PLOP and some fizzing. He managed to fry the PSU. \n All frantic and being the sneaky bastard that he was, he also went directly to the AS to complain. AS called us and again tried to rip a second one upon which my whole team joined in and explained (in arabic - their native language) that CMPG had been clearly warned to check the voltage setting (a fact that CMPG had again hidden from AS) and that CMPG had insisted to take the PC instead of waiting 1 hour for us to deliver. \n Final result: AS was pissed off with CMPG, issued him a warning letter (3 warning letters and one was sacked), threatened him that he had to pay the repair out of his own pocket (actually he told him that he had to buy a new unit) since it was solely his fault, and had him wait for a new PSU (which, in our case could take some months - it was a Compaq PC and no standard PSU would work with the bugger). During that time, CMPG had to use his old system. \n Of course, I had made a new pet-enemy: CMPG (didn't bother me so much since he generally was at a loss with my arguing)": "talesfromtechsupport",

This cleans up the code. \n All Builders just write new code for each GUI element added so the overall code tends to get very bloated and repetitive. \n Window Builder allows me to hand-code the GUI and to get a quick preview of how it looks so that I can tweak the code easily. \n Also, a major drawback of GUI Builders is that they don't structure the code. Everything is in a single class. \n I prefer to separate my code into logical units. \n \n Say, I want to build a calculator. \n \n I might have a JPanel for the display, a JPanel for the numeric buttons, a JPanel for the basic operations (+,-,*,/), a JPanel for scientific operations, and so on. \n \n \n Doing this with a GUI Builder, without really paying attention to the code, will unnecessarily blow up the code and have extremely repetitive code. \n Writing the GUI by hand, the code can be structured in several classes, can use methods to create and arrange the buttons, use data structures, like  Arrays , or  ArrayLists  to store the button instances, and so on.

It is something that more senior level people might want to consider (and again, return to my statement that the employment process is a negotiation, and businesses are used to this kind of thing, even if you aren't as an employee). \n An employment lawyer levels the playing field for you.  They typically serve two different functions: Reviewing employment contracts and documents (and helping you to negotiate or helping to negotiate on your behalf, if applicable) and, in the event that things don't go as well as you planned, they serve the function of litigating on your behalf against your employer or former employer. \n To the former part of that, as it pertains to the hiring process, you would pay someone like this to review all of your employment contracts/agreements and documentation and identify language in those documents that are unusual, favorable, or unfavorable to you.  They would then work with you and the potential employer to negotiate on those points. \n How much leverage you would have to effect a change in any of this documentation is going to depend a lot on the position in question and how valuable of a prospect you are to that company.  The negotiations for a CTO position are obviously going to be a bit different than the negotiations for a general system administrator, for example. \n To that end, though, even if changes to your proposed contract aren't an option because of the type of position you're seeking (and the level of available resources to fill that position), it may very well be worth a few dollars to have an employment lawyer review the agreements you are about to sign and highlight any red flags for you.

Picture this scenario:  The employer has a budget of $90k for their new sysadmin position, but their initial offer to the candidate they like is for $80k.  If the candidate accepts that amount, never knowing what the employer might have been willing to negotiate to, there is still $10k in the budget for that position.  The employer can do anything with that $10k, but one consideration might be keeping it socked away in the budget to throw a bonus at this employee for good work throughout the first six months.  An unannounced $5k or $10k bonus would do wonders for morale for that employee and make them feel extremely valued, whereas it's the amount the employer was planning to spend on that position anyway. \n Always remember: Perception is reality. \n Will most employers do that with their budgeted funds?

            "It won't work in all cases, but you can try talking to your landlord.  Sometimes, you can work something out. \n In a building I used to manage, we had a lot of tenants asking if they could move out in 30 days instead of 60 because they'd found a place, didn't want to pay rent in two places at once, etc.  So the deal I'd make with them is that they pay their rent for the first month, and if I could find someone to re-rent the place for 30 days later, I'd give them back their last month's rent deposit.  If I couldn't, I keep the deposit.  We used to get places rented in 10 minutes there, so we never had a problem getting someone for 30 days (plus, the tenant is now extra-motivated to make sure everything shows well) so it worked out fine.  But tenants had to ask first.... we weren't offering it. \n In a building I manage now, my super happened to know someone from his other job who was looking for an apartment in the area.  So as soon as we got the 60 day notice, he told her about it.  She came, saw it, liked it, got approved, etc.  By this point, it was the 10th of the month, so she asked her current landlord if he would still accept the notice even though it was 10 days late.  (i.e., she was approved Nov 10th, and wanted to move to the new place January 1st.)  He agreed, so it worked out fine.": "toronto",
            "In my teens and 20s, I never wanted to have kids.  I was very decided and clear on this point, and really freaking pissed off at people who said \"I would change my mind one day.\" \n Around the age of 30, much to my chagrin, I started rethinking that and began wondering about having kids.  But (among many other things) I got divorced then.  I didn't want kids badly enough to even consider being a single parent, but when I started dating again I would tell people that marriage and kids was what I was looking for.  Though--and I was honest with people on this point--I wasn't thinking that I had to have kids or that my life would be unfulfilled if I didn't. It wasn't a burning desire to procreate. \n I remarried at 35 and now I am 37 and we are 'trying'.  It's an intimidating thing to start.  Post-divorce I stopped being afraid of taking risks or trying new things, but the idea of having kids scared the shit out of me.... I think, largely, because I learned that the reason I've been comfortable taking on new things is because I was confident in my ability to undo everything.  With children, there is no undo.  Your life is irrevocably changed.  I rather like my life, so the idea of changing it entirely is fucking scary.  But hey, going for it anyway. \n Also, with my aged ovaries ( wry grin ) there's a lot less time to futz around trying to see if things work the regular way... I have friends who have gone through IVF, and it's pretty intense.  Neither my husband nor I want kids enough to go through that. \n If it sounds like I'm a little ambivalent on this, I am. I think that is a little more common when you're trying for kids over the age of 35 and officially high-risk because they keep reminding you that you're old. (Woot! Not.) Conventional wisdom is that you should only have kids if you want them more than anything.  That kind of thinking is a bit too black-and-white for my taste.  I want to have kids, but it also scares the heck out of me.  I want to have kids, but not enough to undergo medical procedures to make sure I have them.  I want to have kids, but if it didn't happen, I think my life would still be good and fulfilling to me. \n It's not so much that there's a concrete point where I said, yes, I have made a decision, as it is that over time, I've come to realize that I would rather would than not.  It's a hell of a commitment of time and energy and love and emotion and money, it will change my life forever, change my body forever, change my relationships forever... a little ambivalence seems reasonable. \n I have to say, I'm not a fan of babies.  Never have been.   I don't melt at the sign of them.  A friend re-assured me that she was the same way, but it was different with her own.  And, the fun stuff happens when they are a little bit older anyway. \n As for not being a good mother, pretty much every mother thinks she's not a good mother.  Most of them do okay.  Parenting skills aren't something you're born knowing, they're something you learn as you go.": "AskWomen",
            "I did a small rental-to-condo conversion and sold all the units except 1, which was (and still is) tenanted.  We have very strict rent control laws, and essentially, these tenants will have to be assumed by all future buyers, and there is no legal way to get them out.  (Believe me, I have tried.) \n There's no mortgage on this unit.  The rent, which is at least $1000 under-market, covers taxes, utilities (included), condo fees, insurance, and an allowance for repair, with pretty much nothing left over. \n I cannot lawfully increase their rent by more than a pittance each year.  A new owner, likewise, could not lawfully increase the rent by more than a pittance, nor could they evict the tenant for their own use.  (It's because there is a special rule in local law for rental-to-condo conversion.) \n I tried a cash-for-keys scenario with them, and they wanted a very reasonable (in their minds) $200,000.  I said no.  (Can't blame them, though, since they'll never get a rental like this.) \n They are decent tenants.  Very clean, treat the place like they own it (they've lived there almost 30 years), very friendly, they need a little nudging to remember to pay their rent but it gets paid. \n I tried selling them the place (they have a very good income) but they have no savings for a downpayment, I am told they have crappy credit (they were in place when I purchased the building), and also don't want the responsibility of owning.  They intend to live there until they die.  (They're in their 50s now.) \n Once they are out of there, the unit owner could do whatever they like--renovate it, move into it, rent it for market rent, etc. \n This is a crazy, hot real estate market. The unit itself is well-maintained, though needs updating. The other condo units were extensively renovated prior to sale. If the unit were vacant and sold as-is, it would be worth $450,000. \n It's hard to estimate how much the presence of tenants to be assumed forever reduces the selling price.... if I were selling it for $1, I'm sure someone would take it, but I wouldn't sell for $1. Despite the hot market, I suspect it would take months to sell, but the unit carries itself so I can wait. I don't  need  the money urgently, but on the other hand, it's money tied up that could be put to better use. \n So do I wait it out for who-knows-how-long and realize the full value, or do I sell for I-don't-know-how-much-discount and get out of this?

            "If you like the two entry level courses, my advice would be to go ahead and start on accounting as a major. The next two classes that you'll probably take are Intermediate I and II and they're pretty difficult. If you enjoy those, then you may want to continue in that direction. If not, it's now really easy to switch to Finance and have the accounting classes count as electives. You could also probably make a switch to Logistics or Supply Chain or something like that (if your school offers it). \n The problem is that the term \"accounting\" covers a lot of things. The biggest three-way split is Audit, Tax or Financial (I'm thinking of someone going into corporate here). \n Then there's all kinds of branches from there. You could go into mergers and acquisitions, transaction services, hedge funds, specific industries, individual taxation, corporate taxation, tax planning, tax provisioning, consulting, etc. \n In my opinion (biased since I'm an accounting guy) accounting degrees offer the widest choice of career paths. Any job that you can get with a finance degree, you can also probably get with an accounting degree (there are exceptions). However, there are lots of jobs that you can get only with an accounting degree (that's not really true - the CPA is what makes you eligible for the jobs and I suppose it's possible to get your CPA with a finance degree, but I think it would be an order of magnitude more difficult).": "Accounting",

That's assuming they haven't lived together long enough to be considered in a common law marriage (I'm not sure how often those things happen to be honest.) \n Now if they're married, it certainly depends on the state. The state I live in is a community property state. Essentially, and purchase made after getting hitched means that each party to the marriage owns half of the asset. There are a few exemptions like if the house was purchased before the marriage or if it was inherited (regardless of when the marriage occurred). \n In general, without the other person's name on some kind of deed or contract or mortgage, I think any payments would probably be viewed as rent.": "RealEstate",
            "I don't know if this has anything to do with it, and as far as I know only deals with king crab. \n My brother worked on a crab boat for a year (yes, the same kind as on Deadliest Catch) and from what he's told me, basically if a crab dies there's some mechanism in its biology that creates some kind of toxin. Supposedly this is to make it so that the other crabs don't eat the dead guy (crabs are scavengers). However, that rarely happens and the rest of the crew gobbles up their now departed friend. That toxin gets into the live crabs and will, over the course of time kill them. However, I guess that takes some time and if you eat an \"infected\" crab before it dies then there's a good likelihood of you getting sick as well. \n So perhaps it's just a logistics issue. If you don't closely monitor the tank then you'd have to throw out the whole batch of crabs. Could get pretty costly pretty quick.": "AskCulinary",
            "Depends on what state you live in. There are Tax Deed states and Tax Lien states. The two are different. \n In a tax deed state, you show up to the courthouse and properties are auctioned off for the amount of the property tax owed. If you win the auction, you own what's called a tax deed. At a certain point in the future (in Texas it's 6 months), if the homeowner has not paid back the amount you paid (notice it's not the amount they owed... we'll get there in a second) plus 50%, then you can legally have the property deed transferred to you, have the sheriff evict the previous homeowner and you own the house free and clear. \n In a tax lien state, you buy the right to the debt. At that point, you can make reasonable attempts to collect, but I don't believe you can ever own the property outright. If the homeowner were to file for bankruptcy, you're pretty low on the totem pole for getting your money back. \n Here's how I've seen it work in Texas: \n Any property worth anything will get bid up to pretty close it's tax appraisal value. For example: \n Home assessed at $100k\nProperty tax $5k \n Great deal right? You can buy a home that is assessed at a hundred grand for only $5,000. Except there will be at least one or two other people there who have the same idea. I've seen deeds for those kind of homes go for as much as $95k. \n The money is not made on flipping real estate though. At least not how it's made for any serious investor. There are two ways that I've seen to make money: \n 1) Earlier when I pointed out that the homeowner had to pay back the amount the bidder  paid  and not the amount of property tax past due? That's why many of these guys/gals bid it up so high. In the above example, you could easily pay $5k and you'd get back either $7,500 or a house. But! If you bid it up to even $50k, then you either get $75,000 or a house. So it's in the investor's best interest to bid the price up. The counties that do these auctions aren't allowed to make a profit though, so the excess paid goes into a fund (in the $50k example, $45k will go into this fund) that the homeowner can request back. However, the homeowner, who couldn't afford to pay the $5k originally now has to cough up $30k ($5k plus $25k interest). Fat chance of that happening. That's where strategy two comes in. \n 2) What many of the investors I've seen do is buy the deed only on a mortgaged home. The reason is because there's now another party interested in the property - the owner of said mortgage. Notice that earlier I noted that in tax deed states, after the repayment period has ended, you own the house  free and clear . The reason is because of an interpretation of the law that hasn't really ever been challenged. Because the government has the priority when it comes to liens, that right gets transferred to the person who buys that debt from the government. This means, that after the repayment period has passed, the purchaser of the debt/deed has the first right. Your right of ownership is above that of banks. What I've seen many people do as the repayment date is approaching, is go to the bank that owns the mortgage, let them know that you are about to own their house, and banks will (90% of the time) pay you the back property taxes + 50%. The reason is that if they lose the home, they lose any remaining principal. If they own the home, then at least they can sell it or auction it off and get something back. Even if the home has been foreclosed on by the bank and sold to someone else, the owner of the government debt has first right. \n NOTE: This is how it works for tax deeds in Texas only. You should contact someone in your state to see how the laws differ. You should also have a good lawyer because deals can (be expected to) go sour because you're taking someone's home away from them. And last thing.... every county that I've looked at in Texas requires payment either on the spot, or by the end of the day via certified check, cash or letter of credit from a bank. So you've got to have pretty deep pockets to get into this racket.": "investing",
            "It's not a bad way to make money, but the problem I've heard from several colleagues who have real estate investments is that financing is really difficult to get right now. If your credit score is decent, you can get an FHA loan with 3.5% down, but if you get caught renting it out you'll be in some trouble (FHA are only for residences that you live in, not rentals). Otherwise you're looking at a minimum of 15-20% down in most cases. \n Real estate is attractive because it offers higher rates of return, but that typically means higher risk.

            "Hi /u/zun4239 - I work on the product team at Sigfig and wanted to respond to explain how we calculate your performance. \n I believe you created a manual portfolio (i.e. didn't connect a brokerage) & you didn't enter any transaction lot information (information about what date you bought the mutual fund & at what price). Since we have no idea when you bought VEXMX, we can only calculate 1 year return by looking at the difference between the price now & the price 1 year ago. This is exactly what  Google  &  Yahoo  does; I had our data analyst verify that our performance data matched there's. \n The key issue is we don't know when you entered your position and what you did with your dividends (which affects your return calculation) so we can't use that in our return calculation. If you want your return calculation to be accurate then you should either: \n \n Connect your brokerage account to Sigfig  - this will pass all transaction info to us so our system knows the price & date at which you bought VEXMX(your cost basis). It also tells us what you did with dividends & distribution which is important. \n Enter transaction information manually  - every-time you buy a holding, you could enter the cost & date manually. This includes every-time you re-invest dividends. This requires a lot of time which is why most of users choose to connect their brokerage. \n \n The Morningstar total return is being calculated making a lot of assumptions on your behavior. Here's their definition of trailing total returns from their website ( \n > Total return includes both income (in the form of dividends or interest payments) and capital gains or losses (the increase or decrease in the value of a security). Morningstar calculates total return by taking the change in a fund's NAV, assuming the reinvestment of all income and capital gains distributions (on the actual reinvestment date used by the fund) during the period, and then dividing by the initial NAV. \n The key here is that Morningstar is calculating 1 year return assuming the following things: \n \n You are re-investing capital gains distributions back into the mutual fund the same day \n You are re-investing dividends back into the mutual fund the same \n \n We don't assume this in your investing performance because we have no idea when you bought VEXMX or what you did with distributions.

But I couldn't tell much until the last couple weeks; the scale was still hiding my weight with water weight and my 'new' clothes still fit okay. \n But for the last two weeks they've been getting tight.  I finally stepped on the scale again and shocked myself by weighing in at 240.  My 'do not exceed' weight for maintenance was 230, or was supposed to be. \n Yesterday I went back to the gym for the first time in a month and a half (Starting Strength for the win!), and managed to only have lost about 20 pounds off my old maxes.  Today I fixed my unhealthy diet and snacking - no more giving in to temptation just because I can.  I weighed in tonight (probably a bit artificially low due to water weight shifts) at 230. \n But even at 230, I've just created an extra month of hard work for myself - that extra ten pounds is going to take another month to lose, and in the meantime, my maxes at the gym are going to take another month to get back.  Thanks to my own laziness, I wasted not only July where I lived like shit, but now August because I'm covering the same ground that I've covered already. \n The nice thing is that I know that I'm capable of it.  The bad part is that I feel the same fear that I felt when I started this - everything makes sense, the numbers work, science is on the side of my plan...but will I have the strength of character to stick to my new lifestyle, to make good decisions, to eat healthy things in healthy proportions, go to the gym and work hard, and generally live the life that I want for myself? \n The reason I'm posting this is as a cautionary tale - to show how quickly things can go sideways with a new lifestyle.  Maybe someone else can learn from my mistakes (just one cake, just for today, tomorrow I'll be back on track).  But also to share one really important thought with all of you: \n Every day you earn your body by the way you live your life.   Make sure that the body you are earning is the one you want.  Losing weight doesn't happen over night, and neither does gaining weight - they're both strings of decisions chained together that leaves you exactly where you think it will.": "loseit",
            "It's shockingly hard to find any advice on /r/personalfinance about any professional wealth manager besides, \"You could do it for much cheaper at Vanguard.\"  So you should know that going in.  The circlejerk is quite loud and powerful.  Not even incorrect, always, just loud and powerful. \n Your advisor sold you the whole life policy because it, \"Grows cash value without market participation!\"  If it's Northwestern Mutual, they quoted that, \"On average, our whole life policies for the past 100 years have grown at 7%.\"  Insurance is, generally, a terrible investment, except as a wealth transfer tool.  If you're not planning your estate with this policy, you would be  much  better served with a term policy.  If it's meant as a wealth transfer tool - i.e. you're concerned about running up against the $5 mil or so estate tax limit - then why aren't you using a Variable policy to get  real  7% growth? \n Oppenheimer isn't the worst fund company out there, but the funds you were sold are all A-shares, and your advisor should have gone through the costs associated with them.  I personally am not crazy about Oppenheimer because their bond funds aren't that great - why use a company with only half a portfolio?  And their fees tend to be fairly high for mediocre performance.  Did your advisor discuss with you why he felt Oppenheimer was the right fit?  Chances are that he or she doesn't know how to sell anything else. \n Their equity income fund is actually quite good - but I like their 'Main Street' fund better than their 'Discovery Fund.'  Again, I don't actually know that much about them, but Main Street is one of their flag ships. \n The two things I hate most in your portfolio (besides the whole life insurance and lack of discussion of fees) is the real estate fund and the floating rate loan fund.  The real estate fund is a niche investment, with typically lower returns - it's supposed to be uncorrelated with the rest of your portfolio, but real estate is basically as cyclical as stocks with less actual growth.  You'd be better off with a good bond fund...which, of course, Oppenheimer doesn't really have.  Most advisors that use Oppenheimer use their real estate fund as an 'income producing vehicle' in the place of a good bond fund (supposedly their real estate fund is quite good, too, but I've never looked at it seriously because niche investment). \n Your advisor put you in floating rate loans as a hedge against rising interest rates, but that's fucking stupid.  Floating rate loans are  really  low quality debt, which means that sure, you'll get a higher return when interest rates rise, but because the issuers are typically not in good financial shape to begin with (think about mortgages - who are the type of people that go for variable rate mortgages instead of fixed?  Right, those that can't qualify for a good fixed rate), when the next recession hits, those issuers of 'Senior Floating Rate' debt will be  significantly  more likely to default.  Moreover, when you  need  bonds in your portfolio, to appreciate in value and provide consistent income during a market downturn, this particular investment will perform  even worse  than stocks.  But they're an easy sell (rising interest rates!) and when your portfolio goes to shit during the next downturn, they're easy to explain away (everything is down!). \n Let that whole life policy lapse - sure, there's no cash value there, but who cares, there won't be in a couple of years, either, and you'd literally be better throwing the difference into a money market fund at .01% than paying more for coverage you can get with term.  Of the $4k lump sum that you used to get started, how much is cash value right now? \n As for your advisor - well, there's no real point in firing him now, since he's already made his month and gotten the sales charges out of you.  If he isn't using good tools to help you build a financial plan, though, I'd look at moving the account - and I sure as Hell wouldn't bring him any more money.": "personalfinance",

I do exercise now, and I've found that it helps with losing weight, but I don't  have  to, and whether I go to the gym four days a week or once, I know that my diet is set up so that I will lose weight  literally in spite of myself. \n My girlfriend changed her lifestyle with me at the first of the year as well, and to this day averages less than 1 trip to the gym per week, and she's lost about 8% of her weight so far (and about 1/3 of her 'goal' loss).": "loseit_classic",

If I bought a condo of similar size in the exact same area the mortgage payment would be $1,900/month at minimum ( assuming I put 20% down), nevermind maintenance, condo fees, utilities, etc, which adds up to a total monthly outlay in excess of $2,500. \n Instead of buying I believe that,  in the current market environement specific to my community , it makes more sense to rent and then invest that extra $1,000/month. In other markets it might actually be better, stricly financially, to own than to rent depending on local supply and demand.  You have to check and run the numbers!

You also pay $2,500 a month all in for mortgage payment, condo fees, etc. Assuming the house increases by 3% a year  including inflation  in 25 years you will have a $1.05 million dollar 25-year old condo and no mortgage.  \n Scenario 2 \u2013 You rent the condo for $1,500 and invest your down payment of $100,000 and that extra $1,000 a month for 25 years (300 months).

We live a comfortable middle-class lifestyle (minus the mindless consumption... we have a lot of nice stuff, but are more strategic with purchases, and buy any luxuries to last for many years).  OTOH we are also in a very cheap city, and are currently at an estimated T-minus 9 years to FI.  Our FI goal will provide more than we are spending right now, but we have small kids, which really limits vacations/extravagant dinners etc.  We also want to make sure our kids grow up understanding how to manage money, the differences between wants and needs, and all that, so will be more restrained probably even for the first few years of retirement (I  am  looking forward to being able to spend more time with the kids before they are out of school). \n IMO a lot of the younger/more inexperienced FI folks just boil down FI to one factor: savings rate.  That's great, but they don't understand that their financial priorities are likely to change later in life (i.e. $1500/month was plenty for me to live a great lifestyle when I was single, now it's more like $4k).  This mindset also tends to underestimate the time value of money. \n The more advanced FI folks understand that there are three main factors to FI, each of which is vitally important: \n 1) Savings rate \n 2) Earning power (once your have cut your lifestyle down as low as you are willing to go, this is the only way to accelerate FI).  I feel like people don't spend as much time on this as they should.  Over the years I have seen many intelligent, hard-working people fall way behind myself in terms of earnings only because I am willing to be aggressive in asking for better compensations, switching jobs/companies as needed, etc. \n 3) Rate of return.  This one is hugely important.  Yes, you can mindlessly throw everything into an index fund. But which fund? Did you know that if you are going with a bond/equities strategy that rebalancing based upon cyclically adjusted PE10 can net you a 2% increased return vs. fixed weights? That a conservative commercial RE investment can return >10% annually? Dat alpha.  One of the beefs I have with MMM is his RE returns are AWFUL.  He talks about the biggerpockets community like we are some magical group of landlords with godlike powers, but really it's just a bunch of more or less successful RE investors.  No one who understands RE as an asset class is going to touch an investment with a 5% ROE without some other major factor (i.e. massive appreciation, rezoning, whatever) driving that decision.  And assuming that because you have a long-term tenant who never asked for maintenance work that your costs will always be 0 is appallingly naive.  I like a lot of what he has to say, but this is one area where I think his advice is almost more harmful than helpful.  ROI is everything! \n Anyway, when all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.  There's more to FI than savings rate.  This is not to say that savings rate isn't vitally important, but here is my thought process: \n If I can have a great lifestyle that makes the family and myself happy at a 60% savings rate vs. living a lifestyle that we do not find as enjoyable at a 75% savings rate, but can spend some time on active investments and make up the difference in time to retirement by generating outsized returns, then why not? \n If I can position myself in my career to continue to see >10% annual increase in comp without having to spend any additional time at work (managing WHAT you work on,managing perceptions, networking, and helping those further up the chain be successful is, in my experience, more important than the number of hours worked), then shouldn't I focus on that as well?": "financialindependence"

            "As a masters student in finance, I will give you the same advice my risk management professor did: do NOT trust anyone else with your money. Manage your own money. \n You should seek advice and do everything you can do to learn about investing BEFORE you make a decision. Learn as much as you can before seeking advise as well, so you have the basic knowledge to determine if the guy is bullshitting you or not. \n Do not even think about touching derivatives or synthetics like collars or butterfly spreads or any combo of the above until you fully understand how they function, the risks associated with them, and how the financial institutions attempt to screw you when you enter into one of these positions. The example of collars and how you get screwed is that the cost of the collar depends on the standard deviation of the price of the stock. You can negotiate this to a lower standard deviation to get a better deal. \n Your current position lacks diversification. There is no real way to avoid taxes, only minimisation strategies. Long-term capital gains is one of your best bets. Also, be careful with ETFs. Some ETFs such as SPY are a direct mirror of the market, but some claim to be and are not.

            "Inflation bro. In layman's terms, the government controls the value of money. Every year, on average, money loses it's value by 3.35%. $0.97 in 2012 is equal to $1 in 2013. This is why you remember being able to buy a candy bar at the corner store for $0.50 when you were growing up. A little bit of inflation is a great thing because it encourages a lot of investment because you obviously want to retain the value of your money so you put it in a bank account that's pays a little interest or you invest it elsewhere instead of shoving it under your mattress. Too much inflation too fast, however, can cause problems as you can imagine. What if you woke up one day and a loaf of bread that cost $1 the day before and $1000 today (this actually happened in Zimbabwe. It's called hyperinflation)?! \n Deflation is the opposite effect where money gains it's value. This happens when the government buys back currency or markets decide it's worth more. In this case, that $0.97 in 2012 would be equal to $0.95 in 2013! This can, like inflation, be good or bad. Too much too fast causes problems as well.

I screw up all the time, and I'm even following recipes, but cooking is an art of understanding, and there is no teacher like experience.

In honesty, this post is somewhat hypocritical because in retrospect I sometimes use box mixes as a shortcut (My mom used to make this Lemon Cream Cheese Bar thing from the back of the Krusteez Lemon bar box, and it was really good).

I had a loaf once where something came up and during the autolyse before kneading I didn't thoroughly incorporate all the flour, I left some clumps of somewhat dry flour and when I came back for some stretch and folds, the flour had dried up into crusty bits and some of it sort of become a skin instead of hydrating. I could fold them in and pick the crusty bits out and carry on with the bread like normal but occasionally I would cut a slice of bread with a hard-looking bit that was all white or a portion of it was lighter than the rest of the loaf, which was the part that had become a skin.

It might just be your starter, and how you take care of it/the times/temperatures you are using when making the bread.

            "Force thawing in hot water is generally discouraged (and also against many health codes). First of all, it guarantees that the surface and shallow parts of the meat will reach temperatures deemed dangerous prior to cooking. It may not seem like a big deal, but between 4 and 60 degrees centigrade, salmonella doubles its population every ~15 minutes, slightly slower at say 5 degrees, fairly faster at 59 degrees. Force thawing in cold water also presents this risk, but the generally accepted practise is that colder water (health code in Ontario states under 21 degrees Centigrade) poses less of a risk than hotter water as the warmer the water (as long as it is under 60 degrees centigrade), the faster the bacterial growth and reproduction. \n The risk you are taking by using warmer water is accelerating bacterial growth in your food. It SHOULD still be safe if you cook it properly, but you also increase the risk of bacterial contamination on other things it comes in contact with while raw (by increasing the bacterial count on the product itself). \n For force thawing via microwave or cold water, the greater risk that we see happen frequently is the product reaches the temperature danger zone (TDZ) for a period of time, allowing accelerated bacterial growth, and then the product cools back to refrigerated temperatures (upon being returned to the fridge or re-frozen) and the bacteria go dormant or form spores instead of dying. If using the meat for anything cooked less than well-done, this can lead to hazardous amounts of bacteria surviving the cooking process. If the meat is contaminated with a spore-forming bacteria, the spores may even survive well-done temperatures, and then re-awaken after ingestion. \n On top of that, hot-water thawing is discouraged because temperatures above ~40 degrees centigrade can start denaturing some proteins, and initiate cooking of the meat. In addition to the bacterial risk in this temperature range, you may end up overcooking and toughening the outer surfaces of the meat you are using, as you are effectively sous-vide-ing the meat when you use high temperatures.": "AskCulinary",
            "Titans and Supercarriers are often sold. If you look in the Sell forum on eveonline.com, many are for sale at any given time. I know that CFC has a strict policy banning the sale of supercapitals outside of the CFC itself, but many organizations are more lax. The HBC, for example, only requires that an ambiguously-defined effort be made to keep the ship in HBC hands, but if a buyer isn't found in a suitable time-frame, the seller is permitted to sell it on the open market. \n There are also corporations and alliances which gain much of their income by building and selling supercapitals on the open market. In those cases, the alliances typically are renters behind large coalitions, or inhabit otherwise undesirable areas of space. This removes much of the danger of having these superweapons turned against them. The renters lack organizational loyalty and tend to strike a new deal with the new landlords if their old landlords are getting crushed. The ones which live in undesirable space have little reason to fear an attack on their sovereignty because the effort required to flip a system simply isn't worth the logistical and human effort in remote and shitty areas of space. \n There are examples where rampant supercapital sales went wrong, particularly the old Northern Coalition, which sold massive amounts of supercapitals to wealthy Russian alliances, and then decided to invade those same alliances, and suffered failcascading defeats and massive losses at the hands of the ships they had sold. Very much selling the rope with which they were hung. However, since then, various game changes have made supercapitals less of a \"win\" button, and more of an escalation of force. For example, it used to be that a ship which logged off aggressed would disappear after 15 minutes in space, no matter what. So, even if a force managed to catch a lone supercarrier or titan in space with no support fleet (which, though rare, had been known to happen), they had a maximum of 15 minutes to eat through tens of millions of hitpoints. In large super fleets, this made it quite common to see the losing side log their supercapitals off, and suicide triage carriers onto the field to keep them alive for the 15 minutes. This was changed a few months ago to where the ships logging out under aggression now disappear from space 15 minutes after they stop being aggressed. Shortly after this change, there was an incident where a Buzzard with a rocket launcher on it kept a Nyx (iirc), which had logged off, in space for nearly an hour while a fleet was organized to come kill it. \n The introduction of Time Dilation (TiDi) also helped to kill supercapitals. Often, large numbers of supercapitals (and the associated fighterbombers) being in one system would simply kill the node. A fleet trying to jump in would blackscreen, and wake up in station. Two-sided supercapital fights often depended on which fleet arrived first, or which fleet had more people blackscreen. Now the server doesn't start experiencing lag until 10% TiDi, which means you can often get over a thousand pilots in a system before lag begins to affect things. \n On top of those big changes, Supercarriers can no longer carry ordinary drones, only Fighters and Fighterbombers. This means no more meatgrinders of a few dozen Aeons spitting out 20 Sentry Drones each, and mowing down anything within range (though SlowCats is basically just this in Archon form). Also, it makes it harder for supercarriers to clear hictors and dictors off the field, as fighters and fighterbombers do not hit such ships very well, being better at taking down other capital ships. Titans have also lost the ability to doomsday subcapital ships. Nowadays being the only hictor on field with a Titan that jumped instead of bridging isn't a quick death and then watching as the titan waits out it's doomsday timer while capping up, and jumps out. \n Finally, Dreadnoughts have been slightly buffed (most noticeably with tracking speed improvements and the T2 siege module). This allows them to spit out a silly amount of damage (ask me about my buddy's pimped Moros in a C5 Magnetar), and makes a handful of Dreadnoughts much more of a threat to isolated supercapitals. \n The hardest part for many pilots isn't finding a hull to buy, but finding a seller willing to use the same 3rd party as you are (though there are a handful of \"standard\" 3rd parties who have a reputation for being trustworthy).": "gaming",

Both organizations have been widely criticized for being composed of members with ludicrous human rights records who's main interest is to deflect criticism from themselves, and demonize Israel.\nAs an example, Sudan was elected to lead the CHR in 2004, right in the middle of the Darfur genocide.\nIn 2002, the CHR passed a resolution encouraging Palestinians to commit acts of terrorism.\nIn 2004 issues like honour killings, women's rights, stoning women, and female genital mutilation were brought up, the CHR rejected \"any criticism as interference in the internal affairs of a sovereign state.\" \n Now, Israel is the only country in the world that the new and improved HRC has condemned by name, passing 15 codemming resolutions in its first 2 years in operation. Now, it has expressed \"deep concern\" towards Sudan, but it mandated that it must review Israeli human rights violations at every session of the HRC. That resolution was sponsored by the Organisation of the Islamic Conference, which makes up a large voting bloc in the HRC. Despite attempts by Human Rights Watch, the HRC has declined to investigate human rights violations in Darfur or those committed by Palestinian militants. Only Israel. \n As Kofi Annan put it: the Commission should not have a \"disproportionate focus on violations by Israel. Not that Israel should be given a free pass. Absolutely not. But the Council should give the same attention to grave violations committed by other states as well. \n And what does Ban Ki-moon say about it? \"The Secretary-General is disappointed at the Council's decision to single out only one specific regional item given the range and scope of allegations of human rights violations throughout the world.\" \n The Council has been accused of having a \"pathological obsession with Israel\" (Alejandro Wolf) \n The HRC set up a commission to investigate the Israel-Hezbollah/Lebanon war of 2006, but explicitly prohibited that commission from investigating the actions of Hezbollah. \n In 2008, Canada (then a member) was the only dissenting vote on a statement condemning Israeli military actions in the Gaza Strip.

            "Optimal range is a separate calculation than tracking. Basically, at up to your optimal range, you can do full damage, if your turrets can track fast enough. So, with a 5% bonus to a 100m optimal range, yes, you can do full damage out to 105m instead of 100m. \n Tracking is a separate consideration entirely, and yes, it is harder to track things that are closer in. Tracking is based on the other ship's transversal velocity (and possibly also their sig radius). If they are farther away, they have to go faster laterally relative to your ship to maintain the same transversal velocity. The trade-off being (to orbiting closer) that the closer you orbit, the more agile your ship has to be to maintain speed. The importance of transversal velocity can also allow a smart pilot in a larger ship to kill a pilot orbiting them in a smaller ship. When they start to swing around the front or rear of your ship, just start your ship going in the opposite direction that they are, and punch your MWD. This will kill their transversal, hopefully allowing your turrets to track them and insta-pop them before they can fix their orbit.": "Eve",

            "Like everyone else has mentioned it should be safe. If the burger itself is safe you could eat it raw, rare, medium rare, etc. A great way to ensure this is to use ground meat that is processed at your local grocery. If you are using meat from a store that does not grind it in house such as Walmart you need to make sure it reaches at least 165F if not 180F. Commercially ground beef has sickened and killed too many people to not adhere to this guideline. Commercial ground beef can come from multiple cows and some of the stuff they add into it could come from any part of the cow and therefore could easily be contaminated with dangerous bacteria/parasites. To lessen the risk of getting sick from ground beef that is not cooked to 165/185F make sure to get beef that is ground at the place you buy it from. \n If you are not sure that the beef has been ground in house look at the packaging. An in house ground meat will be shrink wrapped. If you don't see a meat room it's probably not ground in house. If you see a meat room it might be worth asking. \n It's also good to have an [instant read thermometer]( To make sure it is calibrated stick it into a glass of water with ice in it and make sure that it reads 32F. If you get a digital version like the one I linked to you won't have to worry about calibrating it. \n Good luck with you endeavors. Cheers.": "Cooking",
            "Pepper definitely has its place. As you mentioned it is its own spice as appose to salt which is a mineral and is not a spice. \n I find the use of pepper to be a great way to tell where a chef is with their development/how good a chef is. Only a young chef or a shitty chef will mix their salt and pepper together. There is no control this way and it ensures all dishes will get pepper. Some chefs will have the sense to have the pepper and salt in separate dishes, but add the same amount of salt and pepper to each dish; this denotes a chef who hasn't learned to properly season things yet and does not have a good palate. Yet other chefs understand that you must season things different, but still add pepper to all things; these are the most puzzling of chefs and are destined to never be at the top of their game. A great chef understands how much salt is needed will not put pepper in all things and will even adjust the size of their pepper grinds to fit the task at hand.": "food",
            "Thank you zman. You have made the suggestion I was planning on; only better. \n The one thing I might add is that you can get even better results if you use a cloth or metal filter with this. No paper taste and the oils add more flavor. \n Speaking of oils...I think OP is severely misinformed when it comes to cholesterol and coffee oils. Not all fats and oils lead to high cholesterol. Some even lower it. The body and/or enzymes break down fat and sometimes some of it changes to cholesterol. This cholesterol can be bad or good. It is advantageous to have a high level of healthy cholesterol, but obviously the same can't be said about bad cholesterol. \n This being said; coffee should be of no concern. Neither should: grass fed beef, grass fed buffalo, wild salmon, shrimp that is not fried in bad/saturated oils (they are high in cholesterol, but the body breaks this down and it does not get absorbed as cholesterol), olive oil/olives, avocados, butter and even lard. \n It is important to understand what leads to high cholesterol. It is mainly genetics and saturated fats. If one eliminates healthy fats and fatty acids it can actually cause bad cholesterol levels to be raised and have many other negative health impacts.": "Coffee",

It was way more work than it was worth. You basically had to fill the water reservoir about two thirds full and wait for the whistling to stop, then you had to open the steam wand up fully into a glass while it spit out hot water that would eventually turn intol steam, at this point you couldn't stop the steam without messing it up so you had to have your pitcher of milk at the ready, you then plunged the steam wand into the milk and hope that the wand would continue to steam and not start shooting out water before you were done steaming the milk.

Once you get accustomed to using it you can have an amazing amount of control when seasoning things.

            "At the local mall there were fountains set up all over the place. Around Christmas time they would drain the fountains and set up all of these animatronic elves building all sorts of cool things. There were trains and Christmas music. It was the most magical thing a little kid like myself could ever see. I would spend hours looking at these different scenes. \n One time I saw a midget couple (little people couple?). I had never seen a little person before. I wasn't sure if they were elves that had come from the north pole to make sure the animatronic elves were in working order. To this day that set up was so impressive that it seems like only a magical elf could pull it off. I have no idea how long it must have taken to set that mall up. Anyhow...I see these little people and my jaw drops to the floor. My eyes were as big as saucers and all I can do is tug on my dad's pant leg and point at the little people. I can't move, talk or breath. Needless to say this did not go over well with the little people. They got very angry. The gentleman gave me the middle finger then started to march angrily in my direction. I still hadn't moved or breathed at this point. I thought for sure the angry elf was going to hurt me. His wife stopped him from coming over and they angrily stormed off. I don't know if any one saw this besides me. As soon as I could no longer see them again I began to breath again and immediately started crying. I tried between sobs to explain why I was so upset. My parents thought I was scared of the animatronic elves. I never got to see that amazing display again because of this and a few years later the fountains were ripped out of the mall. \n I also learned that little people exist in real life.

It is much easier today to get information on brewing techniques. All one has to do is use google to read some articles, look at some pictures or watch a video on techniques. I often refer to [this site]( when brushing up on my technique and to research new equipment I'm thinking about buying. \n All that I'm saying is that I can't feel bad if someone's feelings get hurt when they didn't go through the trouble of googling a technique and then brag about what they just did.

            "Add salt!  Cooking is all about seasoning.  Always taste and adjust, both throughout the process and at the end.  Just be mindful of things like reductions.  If you're going to reduce a sauce, then know that  everything  will be more concentrated, meaning you should be careful with your salt so it doesn't get too strong by the end.  But if it's not salty when it's finished cooking, then by all means, add some salt!  One thing that I've noticed, though, is if you're salting something with a lot of fat, then the salt may not distribute evenly right away, so in that case, you might need to give it a bit of time to sort of adjust itself.  For everything else, it's usually pretty quick. \n But anyway, salt has a habit of, in some sense, masking the bitter flavors.  As an example, get some grapefruit and sprinkle some salt on it.  I think you'd be surprised how sweet it tastes after you do that. \n The beans might add a bit of sweetness, but won't get rid of that lingering bitterness.  The chili powders will provide heat, but shouldn't add any bitterness.  The beer, even if it was a more bitter beer, shouldn't make much of a difference at all, at least not one that you would notice that much at the end.  Unless it was incredibly bitter going in, then it's not the issue.  Oregano is delicious, and I tend to add way too much, so no issues there! You have other bitter or bitter tasting compounds in the chili, such as the cocoa powder and even the molasses, but the salt should help to bring out the sweetness and take away that lingering bitterness.   Also, after you make your chili, cool it down and store it until the next day.  It'll taste way better!": "AskCulinary",
            "I know a lot of people hate on Five Guys for giving too much fries, but I actually like them for it.  If you look at their burger prices, they might be a little high, but I've read some articles on Five Guys, and they provide some pretty high quality items in order to make their burgers.  This means that the costs are going to be higher since they are going for quality above cost.  While a lot of people would argue to the contrary, I would agree with this assessment.  I love the flavor of the beef, and the bacon actually has some substance, so I know it's there and I can thoroughly enjoy it.  They also offer all their toppings without charge, which means the prices are going to be higher.  Most places will increase their prices by something like $.50 for normal toppings and maybe $1.00 for certain \"premium\" toppings, and no one thinks it's a rip-off because their burger is customizable to whatever price point they are willing to pay.  But at Five Guys, less toppings means you're probably overpaying, and more means you're probably underpaying, or at least being close to what would be considered their target food cost, which if I had to guess, would be somewhere in the neighborhood of 20-25%.  That means that the average burger is going to be priced at 4-5 times the cost that Five Guys pays for it, which is standard, not a rip-off. \n But prices are not just based on food cost, but also on relative pricing, either against other restaurants or against the restaurant itself.  You can't charge $7.50 for a burger and then only charge $1 for fries.  It'll make your burgers seem even more expensive, so it actually makes more sense to increase the fry prices beyond where they should be to make the burgers appear to be more reasonable.  Otherwise, no one will want to buy the burgers.  So they create value by giving you a ton of fries.  They're super cheap to produce (until they start plating them in gold, the potatoes are going to always be dirt cheap, so high quality burgers vs fries will create a cost disparity), and since the prices need to be relative to their burger prices, they just give you a ton to make up for it.  IMO, the pricing structure has necessary business purpose, and the added value makes me like them even more. \n I realize this is over-analytical, but it popped into my head and I couldn't help it.": "FoodPorn",
            "This is actually a really tough question to answer! And I will say it depends, not as a cop out, but because a bun is hard to emulate, so really, you need to find something else. \n So first off, there are some replacement rolls that can be made, and there are a ton of different recipes, such as \"oopsie rolls.\"  If you like stuff like that, then you could work on finding a recipe that emulates a bun. \n But for me...a big part of it is about eating differently.  I don't mind eating vegetarian sometimes, I don't always  need  to have meat in my meals.  But if I do that, I'm not doing it with replacement proteins.  There's nothing wrong with that, but if I want to eat a veg meal, I don't do it with fake chicken and beef.  I just eat heartier, protein rich plant food.  So for me, it's not so much of a replacement as it is finding a new way to enjoy foods so that I don't  need  the replacement. \n Anyway, some options for the burger - the typical solution is just to wrap in lettuce.  A lot of people like iceberg, although romaine (or any large leaf) should work well, too.  When I live in Cali, sometimes I'd get my burger protein style at In-n-Out, which meant no bun.  I honestly didn't miss it.  I felt less bloated after a meal.  Felt great, actually! \n Then there was a place that I went to where you can choose all these different toppings.  I got my burger on some greens and picked a ton of toppings (that worked together, of course).   What was cool is if you have a huge burger, it's hard to eat, all the toppings fall off, and you can't really eat it properly.  Without the bun, you can load them on and get everything in each bite.  So you trade out the bun, but trade in the customization.  I enjoy that trade-off, and I feel better afterward, too. \n I realized that I tend to take a lot of sandwich items and just put them on some greens.  It's really pretty great in my opinion.  I love bread, don't get me wrong, but after a salad loaded with whatever protein and fat, I feel content.  After a big sandwich, I feel stuffed.  I still eat bread now, but try to cut it out when I can.  I just feel better if I don't eat it. \n Sorry if I rambled.

Try some unsalted butter on toast, and it's okay, but you need that salt! \n The whole point of unsalted butter is to give you control.  So if you have a recipe for cookies, you want to make it the same way every time, and you want anyone to be able to replicate the recipe.

Well, I am going to his city this week and I might (wanna!) see him. But I don't know what hope, what think, what feel, what say. I think he is still confused with all this thing. Can somebody share your experience with me? Or at least give me some advice?\nCheers <3": "LongDistance"

            "here's my long, sad original post. \n Basically, my boyfriend of 8 months dumped me, drunkenly when I asked him about the fact that he had lost his job (and hid it from me). He broke down crying and all this stuff about hating himself and being broke and hopeless and living with his mom and still grieving his father came out. I was blindsided. I begged him not to end things, and for almost two months I hoped he'd change his mind if I just gave him space. \n So against all of the advice I received, I did send him a message. I feel it's helped me accept the break up and begin to move on. I couldn't bear that everything was left hanging. I was waiting for him to be \"emotionally ready\" to talk about the sudden break up. I was stuck in limbo and I'm sure he felt bad knowing I was waiting for answers he couldn't give me. \n I said: \n \"Hey, I hope you are doing well these days. \n There is something I've been wanting to say for awhile now: I understand now that breaking up was the right thing to do, and I'm sorry for making a hard situation even harder than it needed to be. The right thing to do would have been to really listen to what you were saying and to let you go. \n Being with you felt great, but things weren't working between us. It's no one's fault. I was insecure and you couldn't share your real feelings. That's not the relationship either of us deserve. \n I'm not looking for any specific response, I just didn't want to leave anything hanging. I don't want there to be any weirdness if we ever bump into each other [note: we live in the same neighborhood]. I'm not hurt any more and looking back, I have nothing but good feelings about you and our time together. I hope you feel the same.\" \n He responded: \n Thank you so much for messaging me \nI'm sorry I never did. I really appreciate you messaging me. \n I just wanted to say that there is no weirdness between us. I'm sorry for the way things went, you deserved better. \n I also have nothing but good feelings of our time together. I'm glad you feel the same. \n I hope you're doing well and that school has been good to you. I'm glad to hear from you. \n I'm here for you if you ever need me. I hope that's not weird to say. Take care of yourself. Thank you for everything.\" \n I think that it went as well as it could have. I think the \"I'm here for you stuff\" is just to be nice and I don't intend to message him again. I really do hope he's doing better. He always seemed like a calm and emotionally stable person to me... seeing him break down like that was really disturbing. \n I guess I don't like leaving things unsaid and closure is important to me.

            "Two months ago, my boyfriend of 8 month dumped me suddenly. He showed up drunk at my house one night and when I asked him about the fact that I had heard from a mutual friend he had been fired from his job, he broke down sobbing hysterically, calling himself a loser and all sorts of names for hiding it from me, saying that had ruined everything between us. He told me that he was seriously depressed and spent most of his days in bed but had been hiding it from me. He told me he was preparing to go out west to scatter his dad's ashes. His father had died driving driving drunk less than two years ago. He only spoke about him a few times and that was just to hint at his anger and hatred of the man. He has also mentioned that his mother had become an angorophobe and that he was the \"man of the house\" now, in charge of looking after his younger brothers and sisters, who he has conflicts with apparently. He was also very ashamed of the  fact that he lives at home and works low-paying jobs despite being very educated (lots of student debt). Also, He's Irish-Italian and Catholicism is a big part of his life culturally but he does not believe in god, I was raised without religion but this a big crisis for him, when I asked him about it months ago he wept, saying he misses god. \n He was a great boyfriend to me, always caring and supportive when I was stressed or anxious. He very open to listening to my problems but was very tight-lipped when it came to his own. I guess our relationship dynamic was that he was the strong one, he called me his little girl or special one and really doted on me. I leaned on him and I guess he felt he couldn't lean on me. This was the happiest time of my life and the best relationship of my life, but in hindsight I realize we didn't communicate properly. I'm sure he had issues and doubts but he was unable to raise them with me, so it was doomed. \n I always felt like we rushed into things. I have never met a guy that wanted to commit more than me, but he did. Even at the time I suspected he threw himself into this relationship to distract himself from his pain. He always went on and on about how proud he was to be with me and loved to show me off to his friends, it was intoxicating. Even weeks before the break up  he talked about how he wanted to deepen the relationship and be \"partners\" rather than just boyfriend and girlfriend. He said he wanted to be my \"person\" and make it his duty care for me and make me happy. \n I was shocked when he broke up with me, I didn't see it coming. He cried so much, he didn't seem like himself. He felt so small and shaky in my arms. Snot everywhere. I basically just kept telling him it's ok and nothings wrong and we don't need to break up, that he was being rash  but he was set on it. I was stunned. I haven't seen him since. \n I didn't cry that night but I did quite a bit in the following days. I got drunk and texted him basically begging for him back and being a sad sack. I said I'd wait as long as he needed and that I was there for him to talk whenever he's ready and that I needed him. I realize now that if he wasn't able to talk when we were together, he wont be now. \n He was extremely apologetic throughout this, saying he is a horrible human being for hurting the one he cares about and betraying my trust and that I probably hate him now. he seemed genuine to me.  He kept saying this wasn't it for us and he'd still be here for me. He kept insisting we'd be friends but we weren't friends before (we started dating pretty much as soon as we were introduced) \n I want to meet with him to tell him I accept his decision. I can't stand leaving things off at me begging for him back. He told me he is too depressed to be together and I respect that, besides our relationship could never work if he is unable to express his feelings. I miss him dearly, but I wouldn't want to get back together unless we committed to working on our inability to address his feelings and he went to some sort of grief counseling. I don't want to go through that again, I would need to know it's what he really wanted and now that he was just afraid of being alone or felt guilty for hurting me. I hate to think of him beating himself up over this though, I want to tell him I'm ok. \n Personally, I'm not friends with my exes, but I'm on good terms. They've all been friends of friends and being civil post-break up is important to keep my social circle harmonious. I live near him and have mutual friends, we frequent the same places. Running into him seems inevitable. In fact my best friends have run into him a few times already. I don't want to bump into him at the convenience store in my sweat pants or drunk at a bar, or for one of us to be on a date. I'd like to plan ahead, be emotionally ready. \n I feel like meeting for a coffee or a walk in the park would be a good way to get closure. I've done this with exes before and it has helped me be on good terms. Even if I'm the one being dumped it helps to feel like this is something we are deciding together, although my break ups have all been pretty mutual and I have never liked someone they way I liked this guy. I'm sure meeting him would make me feel sad, but the last time was so crazy and unexpected, I feel like a convo where nither of us is drunk and crying would help me move on. \n Also, shortly after my sad begging for him back texts, I lost my phone and my number changed. He could still contact me through face book though and it's probably best I didn't have his number for while there. \n I'm doing ok, all the other things in life are still the same. I was very happy when we were together but he was just one part of it. I still have a good job, good friends, a nice apartment,  I'm still working on school. I'm still just where I want to be. Things are falling into place for me and he was just one piece. \n In my ideal scenario, He'd be his regular self and have a new job. He'd be feeling better and we'd hug and say we cared. I don't to dissect what went wrong or him to explain. I just want to say it's ok. I never could stand unresolved conflict. \n Everyone says I should just block him off everything and forget he existed but I can't. I want to be able to look back on our tine together and feel good. \n I want to reach out to him and clear the air, break the ice or whatever. I read an article for school that I thin he'd like. We used to send each other stuff all the time. would that be weird, to pass it along in a friendly way? what about liking things on face book, that's a pretty low key way to say \"I don't hate your guts\"": "relationships",
            "Firstly, I want to apologize for generalizing. I've met my fair share of dull or unpleasant women and I'm sure there are lots fascinating, fun, kind men out there. I'm just reflecting on my relationships, sexual or otherwise. \n I've always gotten on better with women and femmey people. I'm a gal's gal I guess. I've never had a close male friend and my dating relationships haven't been that intimate (or serious). I feel like I struggle to relate to men and it's really starting to worry me. \n Women seem to like doing stuff more. And talking about stuff. Over the years I've had some really fun adventures with women. Hiking, swimming, bike rides, art galleries, punk shows, road trips, shroom trips, laughing till my face hurts, just staring at the stars. \n I've found the men I've dated have mostly wanted to watch tv or play video games or perhaps stare into the bottom of a pint glass. I do like a good/stupid movie but want to talk about it or laugh together. Taking the piss out of a horror movie with a group of friends and some snacks is great. I can't just marathon crime dramas in silence. Video games are fun but I like to just pick it up and play, preferably with others. Not into watching someone \"grind\" endlessly or swear at the tv. I like board games, cards, chess and puzzles, but I have never been able to get guys to play with me. I'm not extremely competitive but I do try hard to win obviously. Like a typical girl, I enjoy watching sports and cheering for the home team but I know next to nothing about sports. I once offered to take my then boyfriend to see his most beloved team for his birthday, he declined as he'd rather watch it on tv. On the other hand, my girl friends will go to beer league games just for something to do. When ever I put on music, guys jump down my throat that I don't know every album or that I don't \"get\" this style of music. Music is a sensory experience, being an expert on it isn't necessary to enjoy it. I'm a shit painter but I'll do art nights with my friend because it's nice to express myself and I get to drink wine. \n I feel like men don't want to do things they don't see a point to. That's fair. But I feel like doing things together gives you something to talk about. Sharing novel/fun/though-provoking situations is how I bond with people. Guys always want to hang out one on one and I find it hard to keep the conversation going. I also realize my prattling on about people they have never met would be super annoying, but it would be nice if a guy wanted to meet my friends. Even just doing a task together like making dinner seems to make me way more comfortable. \n I think this is more about the way men are socialized rather than some inherent quality of males. Men seem more afraid to be bad at something, or look silly or admit they don't know everything. On the other hand, I'm dismissed as flippant or frivolous because I like to be playful and I do things I'm not good at. I have to be good at stuff at work, when I'm with someone I just want to goof off. \n Women seem more open to abstract thoughts and ideas, talking about our pasts and imagining the future. Women can talk about their fears and times they failed without worrying they'll be mocked. I feel like you need to be able to do that to have real intimacy. \n This is not to bash men, I really really want to get close to a man. I want to meet a guy and fall in love and have him as my best friend and partner in crime. Maybe I'm just emotionally immature and this is some elaborate way of avoiding adulthood. Maybe I'm a chatter box and totally annoying to men. \n I also want to add to (already long) post that I am genuinely wondering about my sexuality. I often try to picture what being with a woman romantically might be like. I feel like I have no script for dating women and I don't even know where to start. I've had very close \"best friends\" where the relationship is almost passionate. Constant declarations of love, being available to each other 24/7, sharing everything, sleeping in the same bed and being physically affectionate. I do feel love and attraction towards women but I don't know how to actually date a woman and not just play girlish games. I'm also terrified I'd be shit in bed": "relationships",

            "Two mornings ago I woke up at my casual sex partner's place and he was still asleep, I noticed on his night stand a bottle of pills. Lithium, prescribed to him, filled recently. He's never mentioned any mental health issues to me. \n I've been hooking up with this guy on and off since 2010. We are both 26. I've had a few long term relationships over that time so I just stopped responding to his texts. Despite this, He'd leave me ramble-y voice messages late at night and once after he heard I was in a fire he face book messaged me saying that he loved me and that I should live with him, despite the fact that we have never been on a proper date. I don't even really know who he is, he sought me out cause we are from the same small home town and met briefly at a party after high school but I barely remember that. He's also sent me a number of messages apologizing for being a bad friend or asking if I care about him. \n It goes down with him the same, at about midnight he texts asking me to come over or me to come over there. So obviously, I have just assumed he thinks of me as just a booty call. We never ever have penetrative sex, just lots of kissing and oral. I think I've probably made him cum 3 times in the dozens of times I've tried and that took hours. That would be the lithium, right? He also has had some serious weight fluctuations... I think a bit of chub is cute tho. \n He is always very calm when we are together. He says he's more of a listener. Sometimes he hardly talks at all. He also doesn't really make facial expressions. He's really gentle and sort of childlike, two weeks ago he decided we should take a bubble bath. But sometimes I see him posting cyptic statuses like crazy on face book. He's also a professional guitar player and lives in a recording studio (like, it's not HIS recording studio, I don't know why they let him sleep there). So he records a lot of odd, \"tripy\" guitar music with lots of effects pedals... like a song every couple days. He also mentioned he can go a week without venturing outside \n Anyway...I'm feeling like his odd behavior suddenly makes sense. tbh I was worried he was somesort of drug addict so I'm relived. To be honest I have my own mental health issues. I know I'm not a doctor and it's a bad idea to diagnose. But do really like him and we've gotten closer in the last few months.

            "I work in a health food/ organic grocery store. A young man comes in pretty much every day (sometimes twice) as he lives across the street.

I'm not good at this stuff. \n This went on for weeks to the point that it must seem obvious to him that I think he's cute. It's a small store and I felt hyper aware of him every time he was in there, and he seemed to be making excuses to talk to me. After spending five minutes helping him pick out ice cream today, I resolved to consult r/dating on how to get a date with this guy. \n He came back a couple hours later though, and bought a few more things. At the check out he handed me his number and said he'd like to get coffee. I got all giggly and he walked away without his groceries and had to come back for them. \n Not sure what to do next, how long do I wait? call or text? what do I say? he mentioned he was working nights (he is a camera man on a tv show) so I don't want to bug him when he's sleeping.

I wanted 4 kids, i wanted to adopt most of them but was willing to try for a bio as well. due to my families medical history I would have been ok if a pregnancy did not happen (I have difficulty getting pregnant). he was disappointed but loved me enough to continue on with the relationship. years later we became foster parents and a newborn was placed with us for adoption (very rare). \n He was perfect. He came with zero prenatal care, drug, alcohol and cigarette exposure. high risk for mental illness due to family history etc etc etc. BUT he was perfect. Why? Because he was ours. We love him more then we ever thought we could love another human being. He has his challenges but as a family, we work through them. \n Please think about hat you want for your future. And do not let anyone stand in the way of how you prefer it to go. I get that your engaged and you love him, but even with all of that, you guys may not be right for each other.": "Adoption",
            "I am an adoptive parent. Adopting my son was a dream come true for me. He is an amazing, bright and beautiful little boy and I could not love him anymore or less. He is both mine and my husbands world. Both the day he was placed in my arms and his adoption day will forever be 2 of the 3 best days in my life thus far. \n With all of that being said our lives are not without challenges. We have zero health info on the birth family. As a matter of fact Dad is completely unknown. One could guess from what history we do know via other records that there is more then likely some mental illness. So, we know we will be vigilant for that and try to be proactive should anything come up. Unfortunately his is a closed adoption so it is not like I can make contact and ask questions (her request btw). So we have no clues to what to look for. This makes makes us more vigilant and pro active BUT it causes us to worry as well. Especially when for a while we were concerned with him being on the spectrum. The unknown is very scary. \n You have to realize that raising Adopted kids is both the same and different as raising bio kids if that makes sense. They need love, shelter, education, and all the same basics as everyone else. BUT there are questions that you will have to answer that are nerve racking and sometimes scary but they need to be answered truthfully and delicately. There will be that sense of wonder and they may need to venture out to get some questions answered. It is best to support them and help them if you can. In the end YOU were the one that was there and if things do not go well, they will need you. And even if they do, it is best you can all work together. Remember: people change. Birth Mom may be a different person (which can be good or bad) and deserves the chance to explain everything on her own. \n IMO adopted kids should never be led to believe they are biologically yours. If you make adoption a non issue from the start, and are age appropriately open with them it creates less drama later.  My son knows he is adopted. He may not fully understand what it means just yet but we read age appropriate books to him and have his birth card with his given name hanging in his room. When he is ready I will be there for him, every step of the way. I wish we could have had an open adoption, I prefer that. But circumstances were....bad. Really bad. Hopefully when we go for our second we can do open. It is so much healthier for everyone involved.": "Adoption",
            "I was in your situation just last May. I have a narcissistic, bi-polar, hypochondriac mother. I like her for giving me life and that is really about the ONLY thing she has done good for or to me. But trust me when I say she has made sure I do not forget that \"favor\". \n i was to be married in May. Dream wedding, dream location and with very few people there. I had an out. There was no way she could afford to make it. YAY right? I started to worry and wonder. I have a 3 year old son. He would eventually look back at photos and know she was alive but not there. I am the type of person that does not want to taint my sons image of anyone and was worried about his questions later in life. God forbid something happens to her before he is old enough to realize how crazy she is, I wanted him to only remember the \"good things\". That may sound crazy but it is what it is and that is how I felt (at the time). \n So my amazing fiance (at the time) offered to help pay for her but made sure she knew she had to pay him back. The first few days of the trip were \"ok\" as far as she was concerned. She did try to interject herself into every single damn plan with us and our friends (no other parents were coming???) but we dealt. The day we held the bachelor/bachelorette party she decided to throw a huge fit because I would not allow her to come. Seriously? NO. She made snide comments all night long at dinner about the \"old people\" having to go to bed early and not beinh \"hip\" enough. We ignored her. Then she and another \"adult\" then stationed themselves outside the damn club we were all going. I was PISSED. I made everyone march right past them and go inside anyway. Eff them, this is my night and I was going to enjoy myself. \n Fast forward to the morning of the wedding - she calls at 6 am. She had been told the night after my party when she called at 6 am to NOT call that early because she would wake our son up. We had gotten in at 4 am, 2 hours of sleep and she woke him up. The day of the wedding the girls were trying to get ready and be quiet and she did it again. My sister gave her hell. She swears up and down that it was not my sister and instead my best friend and proceeds to pick a fight with her. Again, on my wedding day. \n Fast forward again. Scene is set...I am walking down the beach towards my Fiance. Bright crystal blue water behind him, steel pan music playing, flowers lined the aisle. It is AHHHHMAZING. I get to him, we take each others hands. I turn to look at the crowd..and there she is. Sitting in between my father and his wife. She made her move. There was a HUGE sign saying to sit ANYWHERE. No sides or assigned seats. Again, I was PISSED. And in every single photo of my family and friends, there she is...sitting in the wrong damn spot. \n I wish I NEVER invited her.": "relationships",
            "AP here. Sorry you are getting backlash. Why people feel the need to push their feelings and opinions on others is beyond me. Stay strong. If you are sure about your choice then to hell with them. \n Moving on...I think it is fantastic you want to create a bond between the peanut and the APs! It speaks volumes as to the kind of person you are and as an AP hoping to adopt again you sound like the type of person/family I hope to find for 2.0. \n So what would I LOVE to do during the pregnancy? I would love to come hear the heartbeat. It is such a magical moment and being able to share that with you, not only would help me instantly love our (as un all 4 of us) baby but bond with you too. Especially if you are having any sort of open adoption. I want us to share those moments so there are no regrets. We were there, together, as a family. \n Maybe if Mom did a blog. Little updates. \"Peanut is having some sort of gymnastics meet in my tummy today! I wonder if it was the 3 chocolate chip cookies I ate earlier!\" Followed up with a pic of the belly. Again as an AP, I would feel I was there every step of the way. I would also feel like we were experiencing rhings together AND I learn more about you and the baby over time. \"Hmmm I do t know if I should give you choc cookies. You used to dance like crazy in uour mommys belly when you ate chocolate!\" \n For me...the most important is I would love to really get to know you and your husband. \"I\" may be raising the baby but to me the baby would obvioisly be a part of you guys too. Getting to know you, helps me get to know the baby. I want tk be able to tell them as they grow \"you have your moms warm smile\" you have your dads laugh\". I think it helps give the kiddo a sense of who they are. Sure nurture plays a part....but nature is a HUGE part too. \n As you can tell I am a huge fan of open adoption. To whatever extent it is possible, comfortable and safe for all involved I feel it is better for the kids to know we ALL are there together. But if open isnt for you, I am sure you can tweak things to fit your plan. I hope some of this helps.": "AdoptiveParents",
            "This is why I always try  careful and think through what I am saying when I respond to a birth parents post. Do I want to adopt again? Hell yes. BUT I never ever want someone to think I am only advising them to choose adoption and or to specifically choose me. That is not why \"you\" posted.  I get pretty pissed off when people start getting pushy with BPs. You all already have a crap ton you are dealing with while trying to make the best choice for you and your baby. You dont need people yelling \"pick me! Pick me!!! \" If I were in your shoes Id probably be not so nice to them.": "birthparents",
            "I would distance myself. At least not hanging out with her when he is around. Like others have said, the kids may need a trusted adult if something were to happen. Chances are, since mom allowed him into their lives, they will not go to her. \n Can people change. yes. However as someone with some asshats in my family that have been in prison I can say from experience that IF he changed he would have gone to his probation officer and said \"Hey, I met this girl. We really like each other and want to move in together. Is that possible? What can I do to help the situation give my past?\" He OBVIOUSLY did not do that which leads me to believe no changes have been made.": "TwoXChromosomes",

He will ask for a LOT of green because it is his favorite but he will also pick purple, light blue, the flowers and fence pieces, makes sure to get both girl and boy figures etc. We have yet to find pink in the bulk but I know for certain he would snag those as well. \n The Make Your Own figures can be anything you want. Want a girl warrior to go along with a set that did not come with one? Go make one. Girl Pirate? Same thing. I know because my son made some. \n We have never pushed him either way. He wanted a doll because we recently lost a foster baby (he went to another family). He got one. For Christmas he got a kitchen set. And every now and then he \"takes care of it\". He wanted the Cars and Planes figures...he got them eventually. His favorite character? Dottie from Planes. He has sports equipment and takes TKD and is all boy.

            "Hey /r/dating , thanks for reading.\nI'll try to cut my story short.\nI've always been a bit of a social mess. I'm ''diagnosed with Aspergers'' which means I should have difficulty in social situations, but still. To me, I've always been very extraverted towards my friends, but introverted to outsiders. This plus the fact that I have 0 experience with dating, or really the other gender at all, gives me a bit of a headache to say the least.\nI'm 17 now, and I've shared classes with this girl for 2 years in High School. I'm in my final year now, and I share ZERO classes with her. Just my luck, because I started really liking her towards the end of last year, for no apparent reason.\nBefore now I would've probably ignored these feelings but I've recently started losing a ton of weight (weighed in at about 97KG before, now I'm roughly 80.5 (213lbs to 177lbs), started putting a bit of gel in my hair, started using a bit of cologne, the regular stuff. I'd never really care before this point, but I do now for some reason.\nSo anyhow, since I've recently started liking this girl, I actually want to go for it and give it a shot, and feel good about it. But I just have no idea how to handle it. I know it should be simple but I just don't feel it. I've talked to her before in the past 2 years, and we share the hobby of Basketball (well, I quit playing in a team 3 years ago, she joined after that, but I still do it a bit with friends sometimes.). We always made some jokes during lessons, and we got along well. I've always liked her, but not really ''fancy'' like I do now.. Problem is that I don't ever know where she is, because she's having different classes and hours of school.\nBut it gets worse, because apparently I completely obsess over this girl. I can't stop thinking about her at all, it's completely dominating. This also causes me to just FREEZE UP whenever she walks by. I'll be in the hall, then suddenly see her, and not be able to talk or anything. Just completely starstruck in a way. It doesn't help that she's incredibly beautiful and probably ''out of my league''.\nI've been wanting to ask her to play basketball with me sometime. Is this a good idea? If I ask her that, should I ask at school, or through social media or something? I don't have her number or anything, so those are my only options. through school is very difficult for me although it's probably better. It's harder because of me basically never seeing her, and when I do, it's unexpected and I freeze up (and switching between classes, so no real time to chat) [Extra note: I HAVE asked her if she wanted to play a game of basketball on social media before, but she was busy at that time. When I reacted with ''Wanna go another time?'' She said ''Yea maybe''. Very confusing to me! :P]\nShe parties a lot and I've always been with the ''less cool kids''. Most of my friends aren't really up for something too social etc, and are pretty introverted. I used to be like that and still am not the biggest party animal but I've opened up a bit. Still the stigma sticks, and I'm not going to any parties on my own.. :P I have talked to her on twitter before, and ''conversations'' (or what can you even call them) have been okay and pleasant, not terrible but ofcourse it is the internet, so you never know.)\nPlease help me out. I'm mostly lost, and a bit scared of letting this slip by and missing my chance. Especially because I know that once I'd have her number, or just get the opportunity to talk to her regularly, I'd be able to save myself easily. Much appreciated in advance!": "dating",

            "A week or two ago bio-mom emailed my husband that she is planning to start homeschooling my stepdaughters.  Our first knee-jerk reaction was \"No freaking way\" but we did our best to react calmly and think about what is really best for the kids and everyone involved.  It's not like we love the public school system but we were unsure if this would be good for them. \n It's been a busy couple of weeks full of strategizing carefully written emails back and forth and lots of research.  Finally we had her and her partner come over so we could all talk about it together (including the kids).  I tried my best to put aside my visceral \"she's his ex so I don't like her\" reaction and just see her as another human being who loves these kids and wants to do best for them, even if we don't all always agree on what that means.

I'm assuming she is extremely excited for the birth of her grandchild and she can't wait to share the experience with you. \n Honestly, I think your best bet is to set up some ground rules before the baby comes. Say you're probably going to want to stick to short visits, so make sure your parents book a hotel and have some other stuff planned so they aren't expecting to spend all their time with you. The same goes for your in-laws. The minute your MIL says something critical or judgmental, she will be asked to leave. You and your husband need to be on the same page about this, so make sure he is ready to ask his mother to leave the house. \n I'm in a different situation since I don't mind my FMIL, but personally I think I'll appreciate the help. Someone to hold the baby for a few minutes while I shower, or to throw a load of laundry in for me, etc. \n Based on what your mother says, I think you are overreacting a bit when you say she thinks this is \"her child\". Grandparents generally have a special relationship with their grandchildren, albeit very different from a parent-child relationship. I think all she wants is a chance to meet her grandchild when he/she is born and bond with him/her. \n That's just my two cents personally.": "BabyBumps",

            "a cross comment from the previous stickied post: \n The two books I've read over the last 9 months are [Baby Meets World] ( and [Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads] ( Both have something different to offer. \n Baby Meets World uses basic motions a baby makes - suck, smile, touch, and toddle - as launching points for baby care techniques. The author, Nicholas Day, examines current trends and opinions related to breast feeding, swaddling, pacifiers, etc. and historical practices along the same lines. The book is not good at telling parents what to do. It's strength is putting current trends in context, describing human development in the baby months, and offering often funny anecdotes about Day's own experience as a first time father. The big takeaway from the book is there are many ways to care for your child and you're free to choose what is best for your family. \n Be Prepared, as the title suggests, is a how to book. Gary Greenberg, author of the Pop Up Book of Nightmares, offers up some something of a Boy Scout Handbook for early fatherhood. His guide is a sequential arc of a baby's development from the baby's first day through his or her first birthday all with a good sense of humor. Greenberg describes various activities that will be both interesting to dad and help build baby's skills at different stages of development. I wish a second edition would come out to update some of the references, ditch the audio/visual equipment chapter (can be replaced with \"Get a smartphone.\") and add something about social media. A father friend of mine gave me this book and my wife and I enjoyed reading it on long car trips. \n The one book I didn't like was the one my parents gave me: [Dude, You're Gonna Be a Dad!] ( by John Pfeiffer. I've seen other people recommend it here, but, I really hate the tone of the book. My wife and I started hate reading it and, to Pfeiffer's credit, his writing did spark some important conversations early in the pregnancy. My biggest objection is the author's lazy portrayal of men as oafish self-centered douchebags - the kind that get you lots of karma in /r/cringepics. If the dad to be is an oafish self-centered douchebag, this book is great. The takeaway here is \"Stop being a oafish self-centered douchebag! Step up your game and be a dad.\" I tend to see the men in this sub as already over that obstacle.": "predaddit",

I'm grateful that my wife and I worked on communication and conflict resolution skills with each other before we became parents. General discussion about major things is important, but, unless baby needs it in the first three months, you're better off making a decision once you get to know your child. Circumcision, day care, breastfeeding intentions, nursery set up, and co-sleeping go smoothest if you decide on what to do ahead of time. \n Things like sleep training are better left to discuss when baby is in that stage. Any plan is going to be completely misinformed if you don't know baby's sleep patterns or temperament. Even if you do have a plan for some of the early stuff, it might change. We were planning on co-sleeping for the first 3 months and we got an Arm's Reach co-sleeper.

            "My wife and I struggled for two years to become parents, gave up, and were surprised with a pregnancy 2 months later. The first trimester was an anxiety ridden ordeal. When you read about these things you start to wonder how humans continue to exist despite such fragility and inconsistency. We had to actively avoid everything related to self-terminating pregnancies, birth defects, etc. We relied on our OB and her sister, an RN, for most medical advice and swore to only read up on irregularities or problems if they became relevant. Fortunately my wife's pregnancy was very normal and the only issue was the need for a scheduled c-section. \n The best thing you can do this early in is focus on optimizing her comfort and health. Help her redirect her thoughts and energy there. Counseling may be helpful if the thoughts become too invasive. Take care of yourself too. Men go through a lot emotionally in this time and there aren't as many resources for us in this time. If all of your focus is on her for 40 weeks, you will burn out and snap too. \n Your wife should be 9 weeks pregnant at the first OB appointment. While they won't scan her to see the fetus, it is very likely they will use a fetal doppler to hear the heartbeat. Make sure to have a digital recording device handy. Hearing the heartbeat is amazing and playing back the recording of it will bring lots of comfort to her. Near the end of the first trimester, the heartbeat will be detectable on a home fetal doppler.Though it takes some time and patience to get it, we used one once a week to hear our son until my wife could feel him squirm and kick. \n Another good way to get your wife to stop worrying so much is to plan a Babymoon for the second trimester. It will be your last technically child free vacation together so make it count. Find someplace romantic and relaxing and get away from the everyday pressures of being at home.": "predaddit",
            "why not adopt a child? \n As part of a couple who dealt with fertility issues, this question came up a lot. Sometimes the words \"just\" or \"simply\" were put in front of the word \"adopt\". Once you look into the process, hear stories from adoptive parents, birth parents, and the children you see the world of adoption adds extra layers of complexity to raising children. One does not simply walk into a baby store and find a child to adopt. Apart from the background checks, the financial investment, researching ethical agencies, and risking that the birth mother wants to keep the baby at the last moment there are a ton of unknowns you assume once adopting a child. What are the genetic risks for this child? Did the birth mother use drugs or engage in risky behaviors during her pregnancy? What are they? All of these rely on the birth mother to self report and she may not be truthful for fear of the adoptive parents deciding against the adoption. In an open adoption perspective parents are routinely rejected by the birth mother. The process can also commodify children and parents to a certain extent, which should make you feel a little icky about the whole situation. \n The other part is the familial dynamics of adoption and how that will affect the child. I have two friends who are adopted. Even though they both are generally happy with their families, there is a lot of nuance and a deal of insecurity when it comes to how they view family and love. Along with all the normal child development challenges parents deal with, adoptive parents have to address a host issues unique to this small segment of families. What kind of relationship will your child have with the birth parent(s)? What kind of relationship will the rest of your family have with the birth parent(s)? How does this family model seem real without biological ties? How do you address the natural abandonment and insecurity issues your child will develop? When and how do you explain the adoption? \n There are great support groups and literature to help families answer these questions. This does not override the need for a certain kind of parent to take on the extra responsibilities of adoption. There are tons of great parents out there who raise wonderful human beings but do not feel capable of clearing all the hurdles mentioned above. For some it is as simple as wanting a biological bond with their children. Others don't believe they can fulfill the emotional needs adoption creates. Many will find the process of finding a child emotionally and financially draining.": "Parenting",

Removing yourself from this situation is the healthiest thing for you. Right now you need to get a career path going, starting with education. The teen years are especially difficult for someone with your sister's conditions and it is too much responsibility for someone your age. Things will get better for her once she gets treatment but it will be a long road. \n Bipolar and the other associated mental illnesses are manageable with meds and therapy. Many people with this illness can lead high functioning independent lives. However, they can also drain the people around them. If you remain in charge of her welfare, your own independence is at stake. \n Depending on the severity of your sister's condition, she may need some level of support her entire life. 10 or 15 years from now you will be better prepared to give her the help she needs. The next 5 years or so need to be spent setting your life up so you can support yourself. Eventually you will be capable of helping your sister too. \n I bet it's hard to turn your back on her knowing how bad her situation is. If you stay in it, there will be two lives that will be messed up in the long term. Moving away will help you live up to your potential.

            "Fellow ADHD dad here. Unlike you, I got a diagnosis and treatment in the 5th grade. I share a ton of symptoms with autism yet the overall description of Autism or High Functioning Autism (previously called Aspergers) doesn't fit me. Your son scored a 6 on that test probably because, like me, there's lots of symptomatic overlap but nothing intense enough to cross that threshold. Many of your son's autistic-like behaviors are in the \"Sometimes\" or \"Rarely\" columns rather than \"Often\". \n Chances are pretty high that your son has ADHD. Especially since you, with a diagnosis, remember doing many of the same things. His teachers confirm many of the early signs too. Be patient on the diagnosis. Getting it at the proper time will help when developing his Individualized Education Program (IEP - you will be using this abbreviation A LOT) and holding the public school system accountable for their responsibilities in educating your son. You already have a good start on effective parenting techniques for him so keep growing and adapting to his needs. Include your son in the process too. Being aware of how ADHD affects his life will help him cope with things too. \n Medication is incredibly helpful. Dialing in the right meds can take a little time and puberty will shake up this process. Keep in mind the most widely used and effective drugs for ADHD are stimulants. Ask his pediatrician to monitor medication regimens and offer a second opinion. I was overprescribed Dexedrine in high school with bad results that made me swear off medication for 15 years. \n Your experience as an undiagnosed person with ADHD shows that this condition is by no means debilitating. This past may help you empathize with your son and you can show him how you were able to overcome these obstacles. He will struggle in school and may have trouble making friends. However, he will have a support team behind him of Mom and Dad, a counselor, a psychiatrist, sympathetic teachers, etc. This will make things easier on him than it was for you.

            "I can't imagine humans could survive if alcohol consumption significantly inhibits fertilization, implantation, or viability in the first month of pregnancy. The first thing every expecting mom worries about after a positive pregnancy test is if they caused any harm that one weekend they got drunk on the previous cycle. There may be studies that show exactly what alcohol does to promote or inhibit fertility, but, heathy babies are created due to 100% sober sex, sloppy drunk sex and all points in between. Excessive alcohol consumption can cause fetal harm once different organs and systems are developing. In the first month it's just cells dividing so the risk of birth defects due to moderate to a little extra alcohol consumption is close to nothing. \n I recommend not trying to optimize conditions this early if this is your first attempt to impregnate your wife. Infertility is only diagnosed after an entire year of regular unprotected sex not resulting in a pregnancy. As part of a couple who dealt with infertility for 2 years, the stress of wanting to conceive without results and the micromanaging of her cycle and sexual activity made sex and our relationship less enjoyable. If you've only been at it for 3 or 4 months, give it more time before you start worrying about peak fertility, abstaining from alcohol (assuming there's no alcoholism you're more likely to binge by going dry, than if you have a regular yet moderate consumption rate), changing the type of underwear you use, avoiding heated seats, etc. Not only does the sex feel more like an obligation, but the intimacy level between you and your partner diminishes and pregnancy becomes more of an abstract goal than the opportunity to welcome a new human into the world.": "predaddit"

The gene is carried on one of my X chromosomes which means every child we conceive has a 50% chance of inheriting it.  There are four types.  I have the the second best kind (type 4), which means I'm more prone to breaks than the average person, but not from simple things like walking (which could happen with types 3 and 2). \n Anyway, we have one child and she inherited this disease from me.  Her doctor at Children's Hospital suggested we look into IVF for future children so we don't pass the OI on.  Initially I thought they could simply remove the OI gene, but apparently they just discard the infected embryo's. \n Our issue is; should we play God?

So I'm not planning to be on T indefinitely, just until I get the changes I want. \n At this point in my life I've prioritized my own feelings when I look in the mirror, over the way society chooses to perceive my gender presentation. I've tried to work at feeling strong enough about my own identity, that other people's interpretations of it (i.e. being misgendered as female) are inconsequential. So I kinda told myself, I don't expect to pass all the time as male,  depending on how my changes go on T...it's more important to simply feel comfortable, and that will give me the confidence to deal with how the rest of the world treats me. \n And that's all fine and good in theory, but in practice it is much harder. It bothers me that it feels like society is forcing my hand to \"pick a side\" of the binary in a way that I want to remain fluid. It makes me sad and angry that no matter what the fuck I do with my presentation, I still seem to be a target for cat-calling and men calling to me at night like \"Goodnight miss\" \"have a good night ma'am.\" You know, stuff like that. I hate the fact that it seems to happen more when I'm wearing nice clothes. I'm into fashion, I love my clothes, and I resent the fact that in order to stop this I would apparently have to dress much differently (i.e. less gay haha). I had a sort of dark ages phase in my mid-20's where I wasn't really affiliating with any subcultures anymore but didn't know how to dress otherwise, so my style was really bland and generic. Ironically, back then, I passed as male more often...but I just looked really boring. It's just not how I want to look. \n So how then do I reconcile looking how I want, with the reality that I'm apparently not off these guys' radar yet? Has anyone had a similar experience? How long did it take until you stopped getting cat-called?": "ftm",
            "I finally blocked my mother on my phone today because she decided to come out with another gem. Sorry, this is long, but it's...interesting. My annotations are in all caps. \n \"After a number of sleepless nights, lots of stomach churning worry and stress, and, I'll admit, some tears, I decided to try my best to write you a calmer email that I hope you will read and consider in the spirit with which it is intended. That spirit is someone who loves you deeply, and despite what might be seen as a lack of objectivity, knows you very well. In fact, I have known you for longer than anyone on earth. \n You have always been a unique person - even as a very young child. You are intelligent and creative, and have followed many different interests, sometimes to the point of semi-obsession - from Mickey Mouse as a 2 year old, to dinosaurs as a 4 year old (WHAT 4-YEAR OLD KID IS  NOT  INTO DINOSAURS?!?!?!) , to Harriet the Spy, to Indiana Jones, to punk rock, and on. As I have told you often, you have the ability to become completely absorbed and involved by something - putting out effort and focus that goes beyond what most of us can sustain. It's a huge strength, but sometimes a dangerous shortcoming. \n Before adolescence, you had a rare ability to follow your sometimes different path with confidence, which allowed you to be liked and respected by other kids. In other words, you were yourself - a special and unique person - and were very comfortable with that, but still fit well within a larger group. Your intelligence and sensitivity resulted in you feeling things deeply, whether it was sadness or joy. But there was lots and lots of happiness and joy. In fact, you took great pleasure in the many activities, people, animals and happenings of your life. \n During and after adolescence, as always happens, emotions become more intense and more angst-ridden. In your case, you struggled with depression and anxiety. We, as your parents, were heartsick at some of the choices you made and at the direction we worried your life might take. You seemed to struggle with the differences and uniqueness that you had always had by taking some fairly extreme positions in terms of your identity and style, but were very sensitive and aware of the reaction of others, which of course was very painful for you - and for us. Like all of us, you also tried to find an identity and a group that you could belong to - something that at times alarmed and upset us more since we felt that some of the people, identities, and sub-cultures you embraced were ultimately not going to be positive or helpful. Despite all of that, we had many good and joyful experiences together and separately, and you found joy and meaning in your life and in what you were doing, even when the positive was offset by the negative. \n Since high school, although at times it has been a bit of a roller coaster, we've been thrilled with what you've done with your life - complete college, live independently, find a stable profession while still pursuing music, and more. \n The reason I'm giving you this synopsis of your life from my viewpoint, which again - although not completely objective, I think is pretty knowledgeable is that with the exception of what you went through 9 years ago (NINE YEARS AGO I WAS CONSIDERING TRANSITION AND GOT SCARED, WENT BACK INTO THE CLOSET, AND, YEAH), you never, ever, ever acted like a boy or expressed any desire to be male (ACTUALLY I DID, PRETTY MUCH ALL THE FUCKING TIME, I WAS JUST SO MUCH IN MY OWN WORLD THAT I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT IT). Please believe me (NAH). I grew up with two brothers, have also raised a son, and of course I myself am female (U SURE ABOUT THAT LOL). Throughout your entire life you were 100% female. \n INSERT GENDER STEREOTYPING NONSENSE \n You might not have been a stereotypical girl or woman. You didn't want to wear girly pink dresses, or take ballet lessons. (BOOM) You have a slender physique with very small breasts (not that you have any control over that!) (PLZ STOP) and have never wanted to dress like a sexpot. (A WHAT) You've kept your hair short for years and it suits you. (LOL) But you are still completely female. (SAYS WHO) And believe me, you were never someone to hold back your thoughts and feelings, even as a child, so if you had wanted to be a boy, or thought you really were a boy, you would have expressed that. (I DID, FOOL) \n It breaks my heart that you don't feel comfortable in your own skin. (GOOD, GOD DAMMIT) As I try to take the bigger picture view of you and your life, I think it's been an issue since you left childhood. I think it's at the heart of many of the journeys you took into various sub-cultures and identities, and I believe it reflects a basic and deep-rooted lack of self esteem. I firmly believe that this same underlying issue is what led to your interest in changing your gender 9 years ago. If this is something that Dad and/or I contributed to I am deeply apologetic, but as I have said before, we did the best we could. (OH AIGHT SO I'M NOT TRANS, I JUST HATE MYSELF, AND IT'S MY PARENTS' FAULT. PLEASE DON'T MAKE ME READ \"THE ROAD LESS TRAVELED\") \n This is absolutely something you have to deal with. But if you choose to change your gender through permanent means with surgery and hormones, I can guarantee that you will still not feel comfortable in your own skin. (HOW THE FUCK DO YOU KNOW?) \n Because it's not the answer. (OH WORD?) \n You might think it is, but it's an overly-simplistic solution that is extremely risky since it will put you in an even more marginal situation than you have ever been in before. Yes - it's more acceptable and there are supportive communities, but anybody, including you, who does something like this for the wrong reason will still not fit in and you will still not feel comfortable in your own skin. And then what? I am not saying this out of bigotry, but out of my deep love and concern for you. (WHICH LOOKS AN AWFUL LOT LIKE BIGOTRY TO ME) \n If I saw any of the people I care for about to do something that I think has the potential to wreck their lives, I would do whatever is in my power to stop them. But of course the huge frustration for me, that literally causes despair in my own heart (now I'm crying again) (GOOD, GOD DAMMIT), is that I'm so helpless. \n As I have also said before, I also reject the increasingly narrow view of what being a female connotes today, and celebrate anyone who doesn't conform to stereotypes - from Hillary Clinton (BITCH PLEASE) to the many young women like you who are independently making their own way in the world without feeling like they have to have a man to make them whole. (AHAHAHAHAHAHAAHA) \n You need to feel good about yourself, and ultimately that's far more challenging and complex than identifying as male or female or something in between. It's about who  birth name  is, and what  birth name 's place in the world is, and perhaps in a weird way it's about trying to recapture that interesting, unique and confident 10 year old that you once were. (OH OK SO YOU'RE ACKNOWLEDGING THAT FOR 24 YEARS, SHIT'S BEEN FUCKED UP. AIGHT) It's a journey we all take and re-take during our lifetimes, so you are not alone. But unfortunately it's something that has been extraordinarily difficult for you. (YEP) \n I wish I could fix it like I fixed the many minor hurts of childhood, but I can't. (YOU CAN'T AND YOU DIDN'T EVEN FIX MY \"MINOR\" HURTS OF CHILDHOOD, SO NICE TRY MOM) I believe that you need a really good therapist, and should perhaps even consider medication again just to put you in a state to take advantage of therapy. The questions need to be addressed, but without already deciding what the answer is. Dad and I will help pay for that if that is an issue. (FUCK NO) \n So I simply can't support what you are thinking of doing and I hope this email explains why. (NOPE) I really don't want a response to this, and I certainly don't want an angry emotional response. (TOUGH SHIT) In fact, I really really don't even want to hear more about all of this since it is so painful for me, and I worry that we will say things that we won't be able to recover from. If you give this email any credence at all you might want to consider sharing it with your therapist. Or at least thoughtfully consider everything I've said.\" (THOUGHTFULLY.

I fucking love all of them so dearly. I miss them and wish I lived closer even though I love it out here. \n I came out a few months ago in horribly awkward conversations\n(Some of which turned to arguments) to my mom, brother, and cousins.

But despite this, we've really tried to bury the hatchet and have found some success.

My heart goes out to you. I guess I'm just trying to figure out a way to hang on to what I've got, without continuing to compromise my own life. Transitioning slowly has been good for me on an individual level for sure...it's kept me feeling a lot more grounded about things.

I don't really want bottom surgery. The results and methods are not what I want for myself. \n I guess I just want to know that it'll be okay for me when it comes to dating, sex, kink, and love and my relationships with gay/queer/bi men in general.

I've had anal sex before and done anal play as well as some BDSM and role-play. I am definitely a bottom and very much a giver. \n I'm really looking forward to being able to explore and enjoy sex again from the right gender this time, to put it rather simplistically. I feel like being so repressed has put me out of touch with my sexuality. I've been celibate for a year because trying to find straight cis guys who \"get\" me has been so impossible and it just started to make me really dysphoric. \n But I guess, to put it bluntly, I just worry that most guys aren't gonna be into me as a trans-ly dude. I mean, it's kinda ridiculous that I'm thinking about this when as a presumably masculine-looking woman, I was already set up for either harassment or being ignored by guys anyway...so I'm already used to being treated pretty badly.

(And before I get flamed, I am intentionally sticking with the pronouns you chose to use in your post) \n Forget about the transwoman side -- At first glance, I thought I could relate it to myself... I hid several critical desires from my wife (including my feminine thoughts, and some interesting sexual kinks) for our entire relationship of 16 years (6 of that married).

If I wanted to explore it, I would absolutely want my wife there!   And sleeping with a female friend -- if you truly have an open relationship, you should not have to find out by snooping text messages. \n Gender dysphoria is no excuse for bad behavior.

            "I am likely one of those people your friends refer to.   I do not need to change my private bits :)  My dysphoria is nowhere near as bad as some people's -- I have a fairly good life overall and have lived 37 years in male form. \n However,  I have noticed (as have those around me) that I'm not 'happy'.  I'm just barely scraping by, and going about my daily routine as a zombie.   I'm not completely miserable, depressed, suicidal ... just not 'Happy'.   So I spent some time really evaluating myself, my history, the good times, the bad, etc. and through that process realized that the happiest times are those where I've had reason to take a more feminine role in life, and my unhappiest are those where I've been more masculine. \n In fact, looking back, I've used stereotypically masculine activities to try to overcome my feminine side, and each time I have gone down that path I've been miserable.  The more masculine, the worse it got. \n I've always had a fascination with stockings, women's underwear, etc, but specifically as a fetish... Even experimented at times with intimate cross dressing with my wife, always sexual though.   But this time, while I was on the road for business buying some frilly panties for fun, I also bought regular ones.  And a cute Disney princess pj set.... \n And when I wore them, I didn't get turned on.  It just felt... right.  In fact, I had the best night sleep of my life that first night.  And since then, I bought a few more regular female items, and dressed up.  A nice skirt, some shoes, a top.  When I looked in the mirror, I started to see myself... someone I'd never really seen before, and I liked it. \n I started looking at it as strictly cross-dressing... there are many straight cis-males who like to wear women's clothes.  But it was more than that...  a friend online referred to me in a feminine form (It was likely something silly like 'you go girl') and it clicked.  I liked that, a lot. \n More and more, things started to make sense.  Male? unhappy. Female? happy.\nNot just clothes or appearance - the whole shebang.  I want to be referred to in my REAL name -- it happens online and it brightens my day immediately.  I want to be referred to by the right pronouns. \n Do I know for sure that I identify as female?  No... Not at this point.  Am I more comfortable thinking of myself as female vs male?  Absolutely. \n Gender is not binary.  A person could be anywhere on a wide gender spectrum.  Some are entirely at one end or the other.  Some are fluid and may float around the middle.  I'm likely genderfluid, with a heavier lean towards female than anything. \n So, ending the wall of text - just because your gender identity doesn't match your biological doesn't mean you will have the need to change your expression.  It doesn't mean that you have to have a hatred for what you were assigned.  You don't ever need to transition if it doesn't bother you...": "ainbow",
            "warning: wall of text  I will try to break this up as best as I can for ease of reading. \n Quick Background:  37, assigned male, married, attracted sexually to women, 2 children \n All through life I've had hints that something should be different.  In fact, even when I was born, the doctors were 100% positive I was female, such that my dad still makes jokes about wondering \"what that growth is between her legs\" when I made my appearance. \n Through my youth, my best friends were always girls - I could relate to them far better than the guys.  In a number of cases, we played 'dress up', I would wear their clothes and was happy with it. \n I would often look at my boy parts and think they looked wrong.  I often tried pushing my penis inside (I was a kid, it was soft, it's amazing how much it can invert....) and did this fairly frequently, but really didn't think any more of it. \n As I grew up a bit, one of my girlfriends in high school would joke around and put makeup on me, etc. and I encouraged it.  We would often joke that I'm really a lesbian trapped in a man's body... I would even steal panties, pantyhose, etc and wear them under my regular clothes, not for sexual reasons, but because it 'felt better'.  I would never shower in gym class and would wear my gym clothes under my regular clothes so I wouldn't have to change in the locker room.  It felt incredibly awkward to be around 'the guys', and I really did not see myself as belonging in the same shower as them. \n It was about this time that my older (8 years older) brother came out as bi-sexual to my family, and was instantly disowned, ridiculed, etc.  I very quickly changed my ways and was determined that this foolishness of wearing girl's clothes, etc.  I tried to become 'manly', but could never grow a proper mustache or beard, there were always patches that hair wouldn't grow right, or at all.   The same with other areas, portions of my legs for instance are as smooth as a baby's behind.  But I tried, and I looked ridiculous. \n Just out of high school, I got a job in a tech company, and suddenly had to act and dress 'grown up'.  Dress slacks, collared shirts, etc.  I hated it, but that's life, and continued to move on. \n Eventually, I met my wife. During our courtship, we did a lot of interesting things, including dressing me up feminine, make-up, etc. I liked it a lot, but it was strictly in a sexual setting.  She made it clear that she would never be with a woman ('That's gross'), and again, I pushed it aside.  We got married (if you can believe, I found a way to incorporate tights into my wedding attire without it seeming unusual!), and had 2 kids. \n If you're still following along, thank you - here's where it really gets interesting... \n Although I was happy to have 2 beautiful kids (a boy and a girl!), and I know genetically they are absolutely mine, they don't entirely feel like mine.  I wanted kids, but I always fascinated about 'HAVING' kids.  I fantasized that something like that movie with Arnold where he gets pregnant could happen.  And here I was, with two kids that I love to death, but that feel like were carried by a surrogate or something. Very hard to explain. \n Fast forward to today...  I have been working out of town for a year, coming home on weekend or an occasional week at home.  It has given me lots of time to think and reflect on my past.  At my 'home away from home' I have a small wardrobe of women's clothing. I change the second I get to the hotel, and suddenly I'm relaxed. It feels right. I see myself in the mirror (neck down) and recognize myself.  I find myself staring at women, not because I'm necessarily attracted to them, but more admiring their look and clothes, their hair, etc. and wondering if I can ever look like that. \n I haven't told ANYONE my secret.  I'm making an appointment to see my doctor and arrange a referral to a suitable therapist to work through it, to either 'rid myself of this nonsense' or to embrace it and overcome the fear of telling others. \n I cry myself to sleep when I'm home, I cry in the shower, it feels like my entire world is coming apart at the seams, but I also believe there might be a light at the end of the tunnel. \n I can't start to transition physically without telling certain people (ie. wife) first. It's pretty hard to hide some of the necessary changes (waxing, laser, etc), but I fear it will get far worse if I don't... and at 37, time is running out. \n Thanks for reading - I really would appreciate any feedback.

I was so entrenched in male life (mid 30s, married for many years and together many more, two kids, a house, stable executive IT career...) that there was just NO way.  I was going to push this aside like I did every other time something feminine popped up. \n Only it's come back AGAIN, only much stronger. I am part of the 46%. I tried to end my life. I failed, fortunately, and decided it was time to deal with the situation, or next time I'd get it right. \n I came out to my wife as a trans female 28 months ago. I have been on hormones for 23 months. I have been full time for 9 months and a legally documented female with my new name for 3 months.  I am happier than I have every been!! \n I had a VERY rocky and stressful time with my wife. I crushed her entire being with my transition, but our love endures and we are still together, married, sleep in the same bed, raising our two amazing kids...  We each have our own sexual relationships outside of the home and marriage (as she is straight, so I really don't appeal to her on a romantic or sexual level), but we are making that work and trying to find out how best to deal. \n My wife has made it very clear: She is happy to still have me, a best friend, partner, parent to our kids, regardless of my transition.  We just now have a bit of a void to fill...   And I know not everyone's partner will be the same level of support, or any at all-- some people lose everything in the process... And that's horrible beyond words - but even still virtually all of them agree it was the right thing to do. \n I transitioned at work, in a very high profile IT role. I am the only female on the team now, and nobody even blinks at it.  I own a side business with my wife and nobody cared about my transition.  If anything it allows us to identify and support the LGBT community now.  And some of the people I have met along the journey have been absolutely amazing and will be forever in my life. \n It's not doom and gloom.  It's also not a choice.  It WILL come back, and will get harder and harder to ignore.  I believe that every life is important, and especially to your kids - you need to be around.  Deal with this, even privately for now, in preparation of the day when you are overwhelmed and sitting in an empty hotel room with a line of pill bottles trying to end the pain. \n If you want someone to talk to that lived your EXACT story, PM me please!

            "The only thing you said that triggers any doubts in my mind that you need to treat cautiously is the 'after one orgasm I feel repulsed by it.'. Now, this can just be you feeling ashamed of what you just did, thinking it is wrong -- and if that's the case, you're heading down the right path through acceptance.   It is worth mentioning that part to the therapist, though, so they get a full picture. \n Otherwise, I guarantee you aren't alone.  I used to steal pantyhose, underwear, etc from my mom's drawer when I was a kid (I wish I had a sister!!!), and later from girlfriends, and even from sisters of friends when I would visit, and would wear them and/or masturbate into them. \n It wasn't until recently that I was able to look back and identify that I was fetishising the whole thing as a way to cope. \n I am pr-everything, my first therapist appointment is in 2 weeks.. But I have told my wife and my family doctor already.  I travel, and I am ALWAYS in tights, panties, and depending on just how thin my dress shirt is, a cami under my business clothes.  I don't wear socks, so the tights are visible - but frankly look like dress socks anyway unless you look close.  I would love nothing more than to scrap the pants and jut wear one of my skirts -- and none of it is sexual. I don't get aroused through the day wearing them.  It is just 'right' now. \n For me it took close to a year travelling for business and many many nights alone in hotels with time to reflect on life, and then a heart attack for my dad (he survived) to finally make me appreciate that life is too short to keep things bottled up. \n Doubt this helps you at all, but felt good to type it out anyway :) \n Best of luck with your journey - for most people it is a very rocky ride, but well worth the end goal.": "asktransgender"

            "So I just started HRT Friday. I'm familiar with what changes to expect and when on HRT, as I've been waiting YEARS to start. What I'm curious about it while I know that Breast Growth and Fat Redistribution are effects of HRT, and can really help with appearance, I'm worried because I pretty much have no fat. I'm 26 years old, 5'9\" 138 lbs. I've always been the type that could eat ANYTHING without putting on a pound, which I know makes men and women jealous. The only time I gain serious weight is when I work out, and I can get to about 150 lbs, but that doesn't really help me know. \n My question is this: for those who are later in their transitions, or just know a fair bit about diet and nutrition, is there anything I can do, like supplements I can take or certain things I can add into my diet, that will allow me to gain fat in a healthy way?": "asktransgender",
            "I hopped on here before bed to get a little bit of a mood boost, and it really worked. So, in light of this, I thought I'd share my own little bit of good news: \n As most of your know, I xposted here from /r/asktransgender that I came out to my wife the other day (baby step #1). Yesterday, before bed, I bit the bullet and took baby step #2, which was emailing the therapist I had been recommended through here. I was really nervous, because this kind of makes it feel \"real\", you know? I won't be able to see her until the beginning of January, but I just wanted to email her because I know she's quite popular. She got back to me, and I should be able to see her early-January. Totally made my morning =D": "transpositive",
            "A thought occurred to me today. While I am lucky enough that I'm fairly certain most of the people important to be will accept me when I come out, there are a few that I'm truly worried about, because of staunch religious bigotry and well documented opposition to lgbt issues. Because of this, I try to come up with good parallels for the sake of argument. \n So I was just thinking, even though I have seen and used myself the example that trying to explain the sensation of describing color to a blind person to show why it's difficult to explain gender dysphoria, I have never thought to use the example of color blindness in response to people who would question the validity of gender dysphoria as a condition. \n So here's my thought: people accept that there are people who are color blind, or specifically color deficient like a friend of my family. Someone who is not color blind can have the condition explained to them, but never truly understand what it would be like. However, they recognize it's validity because it's an accepted in the medical community and there is research to back it. By the same token, there has been an immense amount of research done in recent decades related to gender dysphoria and its origins. Now with organizations like WPATH, and the repeated studies on the topic, it seems as though the medical science community is beginning to accept the theory that our condition is derived from the brain, and that it's actually got more to do with development in utero than the previously accepted theories of it being a purely psychological condition akin to a sexual fetish. \n I am putting this in my arsenal for the inevitable confrontation, but I thought I'd share to see what the community thinks, and so that anyone who thinks it will help can use it.": "asktransgender",
            "I found this subreddit a while back with a similar feeling to you. I had always had the desire to be female, but it didn't get me overly depressed and generally came in waves starting at puberty. I had no idea about the trans* community growing up, so I repressed those feelings, thinking them unrealistic. \n When I finally starting question last year, initial research about MtF Gender Dysphoria seemed to make it out to be the \"female trapped in a male body\", which wasn't exactly my case. As I began to find more and more people with stories like mine though, some who had transitioned and some who had not, I became more and more confident that I had finally identified a very old and long repressed problem. \n So, in answer to question 1, the discomfort with specific aspects of your body, like your hair and body hair, etc, could be symptoms of GD. The most important thing, if you believe you may be transgender, is: do you want to be a woman? If you could completely become a woman, do you see your life being happier? If so, you're probably transgender. If not particularly, you may just have the desire to present a more androgynous appearance, leaning more towards the center of the gender spectrum (yup, there's a whole spectrum =P). Just gotta do a little soul searching and research. \n Question two is a little more complicated. If your parents practice (I'm assuming) more alternative styles of medicine, then they might be less likely to think that if you're questioning your identity that that makes you a mental case. There are gender therapists who specialize in dealing with gender identity cases, and since the medical community seems to be coming away from the idea that gender non-normative people are crazy, there are a lot of GT's who are less interested in slapping a label on you than actually helping you work through your problems. \n Again, idk your parents. If I can grossly generalize for a second, MOST of the people I've met who prefer more natural/alternative methods of medicine generally stray from the norm in other way, and can be more tolerant of \"alternative lifestyles\". Do you know how your parents feel about LGBT issues in general? If they're fairly tolerant, then I would do some research, and when you have enough information that you're comfortable talking about it, talk to them. You don't have to go in saying \"I'm going to be a woman!\", just tell them you're questioning your gender. Then ask if they would consider letting you see a gender therapist. Find contact info for a couple in your area, then go with your parents to meet them. Keep in mind that what more important is that YOU'RE comfortable with your therapist, but it might put their mind at ease that it's not some white-coat and clipboard Dr.": "asktransgender",
            "So last week, I was off from work, so I treated myself to, well, being my actual self. This meant that for the majority of the week, I was in my actual self undies, and cute jeans, and therefor neatly tucked like hospital corners (yeah I wish). I've gotten to a point where I'm comfortable just tucking in my boyshorts or cheekies w/o a gaff. However, when I was back at work today wearing boxer briefs again, the family jewels were hanging, and throughout the day I was getting a dull pain in my right testicle, like the feeling you get after being hit there.

            "Hey to all the beautiful people here (read: everyone here is beautiful!). I wanted to get some feedback from this community on something that's been on my mind. I am 25, pre-everything transwoman, and after spending months and years on communities much like this one while sorting out long-buried feelings, I finally identified who I am but could not do anything about it because of my military service and the DoD's archaic disqualifications. However, since the trans-ban is on the chopping block, I finally feel the chains breaking and can begin to live as my true self. \n However, since I am not ready to go full time yet, I thought that maybe presenting as more androgynous would both A.) help ease some of my dysphoria, by starting to suppress that dude in the mirror without causing mass chaos in my life, and B.) help me and those around me in gradually transitioning towards presenting as my true self, instead of dropping it on everyone like an atom bomb. What's been bothering me though is that I know quite a few genderqueer folks from different sections of the community, and know there is a certain sensitivity to identity and the labels that come with them. My question is if I began to present more androgynous, knowing full well that in the near future that I will end up fully transitioned to being a (in all likelihood tomboyish) female, will that be in any way seen as a disrespectful gesture to the androgynous community? I do feel like this presentation will help alleviate a lot of dysphoria for me, but I don't want to step on any toes or insult anyone by seeming like I'm using a community occupied permanently by many as a way station of sorts on the road to a different community. \n Sorry it's ranty, just needed to unload a little bit.": "androgyny",
            "Wall of Text...fair warning] So this week, and specifically today, have been kind of a roller coaster of emotion. I have been staying with some friends away from home for work during the week for the last couple of months, and today I found myself home alone because both were off doing important things. Extrovert that I am, I found myself lethargic and mildly depressy, as happens with the immediate onset of cabin fever that I get when left alone. After watching a movie, I decided that I needed to get out of the house. I debated Starbucks, the bar, what have you, but settled on going to try on some clothes. I hit the mall, partly to see if I could find anything there, partly just for the crowd, but it was closing when I got there. Instead, I hopped over to the Kohl's down the street. \n I would like to take a moment to say that I've found Kohl's to be a great place to try on clothes. Not because they're overly helpful or trans-friendly, but the general dont-give-a-f*ckedness is wonderful for the nervous solo transgirl. What I mean by this is there's usually not many employees around, especially late at night, and their dressing rooms don't have the annoying and embarrass guard to count your clothes or make you nervous for trying on the clothes of your preferred gender. If you're just starting out, or alone and not yet comfortable in department store confrontations (mostly imagined, for me), it's a great place to start. \n Back to the story: I picked out a few things, like a cute pair of cargo pants (size 6, but apparently I needed a size 4! squeee! =D), some tights, two really cute long-sleeve v-neck tops with knitted bars on the arms, and a 34A padded bra (probably should have grabbed the 36A >.<). After making my meager selection, I absconded off to the dressing room to try them on. The leggings made my legs look great, but I was wearing sliders that bulged a little, so meh. I put the cargo pants on and picked the small top (still working on sizing, grabbed an S and an M), and with the bra on, I just stood there staring at myself, and almost let loose the waterworks. \n For those of you familiar with my backstory, I'm military and just came back from deployment, and have been working in a military capacity since I got back. This means that though I'm out to my wife and she's fully supportive, I never get to explore and express my female identity. Seeing myself in the mirror, even with a crew-cut and shadow and hair on my arms and chest, I saw right through to the person that was underneath. I was simultaneously overjoyed, reaffirmed in my identity, and torn. You see, I'm married with young children, whom my wife stays home with. I've been staying with friends out of town for work because I'm trying to get a job through the military that would be a significant pay increase from what I was making, and would allow me to be the sole provider for my family. Today I was incredibly happy because I was told by my supervisor that since my temporary period is almost up, the higher-ups are, specifically at his recommendation, bringing me on officially as a temp and quite likely permanently when the permanent positions become available in the next couple of months. This is great, but because it's military, it means I would be locked out of transitioning (at least hormonally and openly) for the duration of my employment. While this is definitely the painful downside to this job, it's a great job, great pay, and great benefits, would be a jumping point to a great career,would allow me to comfortable provide for my family, and within a couple of years would put me in an infinitesimally better position to transition, albeit in my late 20's or early 30's. When I'm at work or talking to my wife or my buddies, I'm willing to make that sacrifice. However, on nights like tonight, when I look in the mirror and see the woman I am staring back at me, locked inside, I just want to break down and cry, or scream, or something. I don't think I'm making a mistake, and I feel overjoyed both about the job opportunity, and the affirmation of my identity, but the incongruity between them is painful. \n Idk if there's anything specific I'm looking for, just sharing with everyone, and getting it off my chest.": "TransSupport"

            "Hi all, \n I don\u2019t know if theres a point to this, I should say outright. I just want to vent. I don\u2019t even know if I\u2019m venting or just desperately looking for someone to tell me I\u2019m not just going in circles/backwards here. I would have just blabbed this into my journal on my phone but shit, it would be really nice to hear from someone, too. \n This isnt a throwaway, so I'll most likely delete this post after a while. I dont know. \n i\u2019m still learning the concept of triggers, but I\u2019m pretty sure this post is chock-full of them. So a warning outright. \nThis post\u2019s got some trigger-shit. \n I\u2019m just super fucking frustrated right now/these days, and don\u2019t know what to do. \nThis is all just feeling a little pointless. \n Since my last post, asking for coming out help, I\u2019ve progressed in what I suppose could be seen as leaps and strides. \n I saw a therapist, and it helped. Well, no. It didn\u2019t \u201chelp\u201d, it certainly didn\u2019t maker me feel better, but then I guess it isn\u2019t supposed to. \nWe worked on me, tried working out how to tell people, the important people, namely; girlfriend, mom and dad. The rest of the family is secondary, the friends are tertiary. \n So I did it. I came out to my SO in October (brought cupcakes. I guess this might be a tip; always bring cupcakes), and while it was a rough few days, we\u2019re still together. We\u2019re still working on it day by day, well, I am. She still has moments where she pretends this isn\u2019t real. That it\u2019ll go away. \n I came out to my mom. She was chilled, and then she broke down, and now I think she\u2019s in the same ignore-it-until-forced-to-face-it place. \n Dad doesn\u2019t know yet, he\u2019s been abroad working since september. I really want to tell him, but I\u2019m terrified. \nWe work together, mom, dad, myself. We run a company together. I know money shouldn\u2019t be the biggest concern here when I could potentially lose a very cherished -albeit strained- relationship, but if things do go south, I lose my only real steady source of income I\u2019ve ever had. (Yeah, only child sheltered living is great\u2026) \n SO and I, at my therapist suggestion, sometimes have nights where I get dressed. The first couple of times were tough, the most recent went\u2026 Dare I say it.. well? She did my makeup, we watched Supernatural. We did whatever, but there weren\u2019t any tears, there was less fretting over how the other was feeling, we just existed in this state for a few hours before bed. (Sidenote, waterproof mascara can be a source of terror when you wake up late for work.) \n So What\u2019s Got Me Freaking? \n The body stuff, that\u2019s part of it. \nI\u2019m still in boy mode like 98% of the time. I\u2019m still straight as a plank, I weigh 58kg/127lb (I suppose this is something I shouldn\u2019t complain about, right?), I still have an awful awkward farmers tan, even though I wear sweaters almost all the time. I still have facial hair (again, its not that bad, I never really shave, only use an electric razor, so my hair isn\u2019t as course as many guys). I still have hair on my chest, and my arms. The arm hair frustrates me the most, for some reason. \n I still have an enormous adams apple, bigger and sharper and pointier than any I\u2019ve ever seen, and I\u2019m terrified this is something thats going to cause trouble for a long time. I don\u2019t know how far a tracheal-shave can help. I guess enquiring would help? \n I still have a big, broken, skew nose that juts out as much as my adams apple, but on the front of my face. I mind the nose less than i do the trachea, but only when I look at myself straight on. Side-portraits hurt my heart. \n I still have a deep voice. It freaks me out more than most of the other stuff. It\u2019s stupid, I could, and should just start practicing, but I don\u2019t know where to start, or where to practice. SO and I live in a tiny apartment, and with her struggling (see further down) I don\u2019t feel comfortable ululating with her in earshot. Also - very shy about this shizzit. \n So, SO is still struggling and treats me like a man, her man. and I can\u2019t front that. I look like the man she\u2019s always known, how could she/would she do any different? Like I mentioned earlier, she still has moments where she can believe this will go away, though these are getting less I think. I let her have this, because since I came out, (and she simultaneously had foot surgery that put her through an adventure of schedule 7 drugs) she\u2019s been suffering pretty intense anxiety. Now she\u2019s been on Xanax, which helps, but she found herself growing dependent on them, and has been trying to cope without the drugs, which has had me pushing all T* things under the covers to shelter her from the stresses. \n She\u2019s mentioned how she fantasises about leaving me sometimes, the thought of starting fresh and depending on herself, not having to worry about all this stuff is a pleasant thought to her, but the thought of not having me, as a person in her life is unimaginable. \nAnd I\u2019ve been going through the exact same thing. You know? Thinking, \u201cI\u2019ll just do this by myself. I won\u2019t have to worry about disappointing/hurting/stressing out someone I care about so much. She won\u2019t have to worry about me. I wont have to worry about her\u201d, but these thoughts are only surface-deep. If I ever delve deeper than this, it hurts so fucking much, the idea of not having her in my life. It isn\u2019t an option. \n Still haven\u2019t settled on a name. \nI was dead-set on Isabelle, I loved the name, but SO reckoned it sounded tacky and forced. I sort of agree nowadays, especially since it sounds like \u201cIs-A-Belle\u201d. So I went for the bastardisation-of-my-male-name route, and settled on Madeleine. I don\u2019t dislike it as much as I expected, I like that friends can still call me \u201cMaddy\u201d as they used to call me \u201cMatty\u201d, my initials stay kind of the same. It works, and it causes less friction, but I\u2019m frustrated that I can\u2019t discuss these things with SO for fear of \u201cpushing\u201d her too much. \n I work for my parents, but I\u2019m trying to get somewhere as a photographer. Its all I\u2019m actually good at, is making nice pictures of people. \nI go with a photojournalistic approach. I don\u2019t really do posed stuff, because for some fucking reason, I can\u2019t seem to connect with people. (I have a fantasy that after transition, or during, I\u2019ll learn to actually stop putting myself down, and learn to love myself, and that once I love myself, I\u2019ll be able to connect with people around me, because right now I just\u2026 Can\u2019t. Don\u2019t. I can\u2019t describe this, but I hope you guys can relate. \nIt\u2019s like theres an indescribable void between myself and the other person, and I\u2019m terrified that once I transition I still won\u2019t be able to connect with people, with the added void of being a trans-woman that people feel uncomfortable around. I kill this notion by thinking that if I\u2019m comfortable with myself, finally, that people will be able to sense that and feel comfortable around me, but this feeling doesn\u2019t last long. \n I live in South Africa. Our concept of trans* is pretty stunted here, even if I do live in the most progressive part of the country, Cape Town. \nI worry about how I\u2019ll be able to afford everything I want, or at least everything I need at least. I get so jealous when I read about people saying \u201cthe company I work for has benefits (mine doesn\u2019t) and they\u2019re going to pay for whatever I want!\u201d \n I\u2019ve pushed myself into a crappy place seeing the beautiful young girls who\u2019ve transitioned, and look fucking incredible. Nice tits, hips, tiny little waists, and I worry, and I think to myself \u201cit doesn\u2019t matter, they have what they have, and I\u2019ll have what I\u2019ll have, and I\u2019ll learn to like that, because I\u2019ll feel right once I start on oestrogen. I\u2019ll get that sense of \u2018calm\u2019 that they talk about, and I won\u2019t feel so damn disjointed anymore\u201d, but until I start on E, I just spin in circles. \n I guess I should stop now. I\u2019m at work, and I need to actually do some work, because for the last week I haven\u2019t done a single thing, and pretty soon people are going to notice. I run my parents company right now, I do all the financials, and correspondence with other companies, and its a very people-person gig, and I have been ignoring literally every responsibility for the last five days and at some point people are going to say \u201cWHAT THE FUCK HAVE YOU BEEN DOING HERE?!?!\u201d. \n I\u2019m sorry for the wall of text. I\u2019m sorry for the triggers, and I\u2019m sorry for all of this whining and moaning. \nI just really want someone to say that this is the worst of it, that it gets better soon, or at some point. \n Below, two photos from SO and my makeup session, our only one so far.\nI like the dark one.

I figured I'd take the course, and deal with it along the way, but I'm feeling incredibly frustrated about this. I know this isnt a magical pill, and that \"these things take time\", but I'd like to be on the starting dose I read most people start on. \nI feel absolutely nothing taking them, which I attribute to not being on blockers, and being on such a miniscule dose of oestrogen. Still, I do feel a slight bit of calm just  knowing  that I've finally made it to the starting line. \n Based on the girls I've asked on reddit and at my support group, nobody has started on an Oestrogen (usually Estradiol) dose lower than 2mg daily, with approximately 100mg Spiro (in general). \n Premarin does NOT disolve under the tongue.

            "apologies in advance for the wall of text. this just became story time... \n Cape Town, South Africa; Police here have a varied rap. For the most part I believe they're underpaid, underfunded and understaffed and those we do have are overworked. I think the general attitude in our police is one of futility. \n Gang violence in the poorer areas are all but completely ignored, and in more affluent areas I feel home security systems and private security groups have a more impressive effect than our police force. \n One doesn't often hear stories of how police helped someone out, I certainly don't remember any. I do remember one story, which I'll relate, because I feel those involved deserve to be acknowledged: \n About 10 years ago (jees, I suddenly feel old and decrepit) my family and I all fell asleep in our upstairs lounge watching a movie. Our house was broken into and ransacked while we slept. All bags (handbags, schoolbags, camera bags) were taken. Basically anything that can easily be taken off with. \n We woke around 11:30pm, and discovered the breakin. This was the second or third time we'd been broken into while in the house, so we weren't hugely fazed, just frustrated. We called the police, but it should be noted this was more a formality for insurance purposes than for safety or retrieval of our stuff. They said they'd come over, but they never showed. \n Around 4:00am the same thieves returned with car keys and stole our Volvo XC70. We had a Tracker fitted, so when we woke and realised it was gone too, we phoned the Tracker company and they pleasantly informed us it was hurtling away at a high speed. \n The Cape Town Flying Squad was involved at this point, and broke into seperate groups. One group took my parents to a nearby township and roughed some people up, eventually tracking down most all of the things they took from our house the night before, while the second team in a helicopter chased down our stolen car. By noon the team had apprehended the two in the car and had already lifted it onto a truck to return to us. \n Those cops had the most antiquated protective vests on ever, and my parents desperately wanted to make a donation for them to get new vests, but this wasn't allowed since it would be constituted as a bribe, so my parents had to settle with buying them a case or two of beer. \n Some cops here are useless, some are corrupt, some simply have their hands tied by a system that doesn't let them do their job whatsoever. \n On the other hand, my impression of the American police I met in Chicago was mind-blowing by comparison. \nWhere most I've dealt with here are rude, stand-offish, and general dicks, the Chicago police I met were some of the most well mannered people I met in the city. Besides the consistent patrols they did, leading to a fuzzy feeling of safety and vigilance, I was helped multiple times when I got lost in Chicago, and was questioned very promptly when I took photos from a considerable distance of the twenty-something cops in the alley behind my girlfriend's house (apparently there had been a few break-ins in the area, and they got close to nabbing the dude. TWENTY fucking cops to catch a burglar. Amazing). \n Feeling safe in a community is something I don't really experience at home, even since I've moved to a very fancy neighbourhood literally a block from a police station. I would never walk the block to the gas station for snacks, and would far sooner drive. In the states I could and many times did walk around at 3am purely for the novelty of it. How much of this is due to police or just good community I'm not quite sure. \n Still, this was my personal experience. I do think that there are some serious problems with some departments, especially with the relationship between many PD's and black communities, but I don't know enough to shout an opinion out.": "AskReddit",
            "I'm confused as to why we would need a subreddit dedicated to something so incredibly niche. Which isn't to say I'm knocking it at all, but my concern is that it becomes just another room with four posts and a shade of disappointment. \n Pro photog, mid twenties trans girl here. I think I get what you're saying, and it's nice to collect ones thoughts with like minded people, no matter how niche. It creates a sense of camaraderie that's super-comforting in a world like ours, but I have to wonder what the point is? \n I can't think of anything going on in my life that affects yours, and neither vice versa? \n You can probably write this all off as just a grumpy post by a girl who can't sleep who has to be at work in two hours, but this gambit has been nothing short of painful and annoying. A segue from comfort to confusion and slowly back again. \n Something I've come to realise of late (and this was mentioned once, somewhere on the tubes right as I started coming out to myself) that people mirror ones own attitudes when they don't know how to feel about something. \nYou see this in so many places, most especially American politics, but in our case especially so. \nAs I began to come out to people, I was tentative, afraid and cautious, backing my claims of transness up with proof, validation and the like, and my attitude to the whole thing was mirrored back at me, with people being equally tentative and cautious/downright afraid of \"what this all meant\". \nThe same can be said for my professional career. \n But as I've grown tired of explaining myself, and begun to Just Get On With It, as it were, it's become far more about the quality of my work again, because I really do not want to be defined by this.

I figured I'd mention it here in case anyone going to the conference sees me walking to it. I absolutely never wear it at trans -related meetups and such. I won't be wearing it inside the conference because it  is* a camera on my face connected to the Internet, and I could very easily take a picture.

            "A cisgender friend of mine, whom we'll call \"Kate\", introduced me to a out-of-the-closet transman that she knows, whom we'll call \"John\". I'm a transwoman and I'm out to only eight people (including Kate, but not John since I barely know him). Kate just introduced us as friends since I'm not interested in men, but the whole thing just felt kinda forced. John didn't know that I was transgender, Kate felt kinda awkward halfway through trying to introduce us, and I wanted to tell John that I'm transgender but I also didn't want to tell him (which is honestly how I feel about everyone). \n In the end, I didn't tell him, and he and I didn't hang out again. Not because he was a bad person or anything, but he and I just aren't friends, and I just can't really see myself being friends with him. He and I don't have anything in common and aren't anything alike, and just wouldn't be great friends. Kate thought we'd be great friends just because we're both transgender, but a good friendship needs more than \"we happen to have the same gender identity\". \n I ran into John a few months later, at a local mall hanging out with a few cool people I vaguely know but almost never speak to, and I hung out with them for like 10 minutes, and it was fun and not awkward. On the other hand, it just reconfirmed how much he and I aren't friends. \n I'm a bit concerned about how this story would've gone if I were interested in men. Kate probably would've wanted me and John to go out on a date or something like that. It's weird to force that on two people just because they have one thing in common. I don't even really identify as \"a transgender person\". I just kinda happen to be transgender. It's like having brown hair; I happen to have it, and other people do to, but it's not something that creates instant friendships. Being transgender isn't quite as minor as hair color since John and I are certainly going through similar problems since we're both transgender, but... It's just not enough to form a close friendship. \n But what do I know? Maybe it'll be different for your friends. Talk to them! See how they'd feel! On the other hand, from the looks of what other people are saying in these comments, it looks like maybe you should drop it. Playing matchmaker is hard to do, and doing it with two friends just because they have one very personal thing in common might not be a good idea.": "asktransgender",
            "Hope it's cool for me to post here. I'm MtF and I've been lurking here for like a year. We're all trans here, no? I'm truly sorry if this seems like I'm imposing or forcing my opinion on y'all, but I figured I'd share my two cents. \n I think there are two problems here.  Neither of them are your fault. \n The first problem isn't specifically the transgender women you're dealing with (I mean, they  are  the problem) but rather, the problem is the community of transgender women you're trying to join. I've tried befriending groups of transgender people, and each group has its own very strong hivemind and its own very unique opinion of and attitude towards everything. It's very exhausting to deal with. One support group that I go to (which is only open to transgender women, and which I don't really go to much anymore) is very clique-y and full of one-upping. It feels almost like a contest of \"who's the most transgender person here?\", where the transgirl who's had surgery is \"more trans\" than the one who's only on hormones, and the one on hormones is \"more trans\" than the one who isn't, etc (this sucked for me because I first went there when I was still questioning whether or not I was actually transgender, so I felt like it was implied that I wasn't \"as trans as everyone else\"!). Meanwhile, there's another support group that I go to that's just for anyone who identifies as trans* in any way. It's a shitload of fun, and totally non-judgemental, and I have quite a few close friends who are transgender women, transgender men, and genderqueer people, whom I've met through that group. We have a strong hivemind among our group, but it's extremely positive and accepting. So, as a transgender women who isn't an asshole to transgender men, I'm sure that nice transgender women exist. But sometimes it feels like we're a bit rarer than I wish we were, and I feel like that's due (at least in part) to the communities to which we belong. \n Each community that you try to join will be different. It sounds like you're dealing with a community that's very insular and which has a very strong (and very anti-trans men) hivemind. It sucks giant donkey balls that these people even exist, but they do (I've dealt with them too. They suck). \n I can promise you that there are plenty of transgender women who don't suck, but I don't want to sound like I'm invalidating your experiences with the transgender women who you've met, because I know that the kinds of experiences like what you're describing are real, and I know that they suck. \n I think the other reason for these trans women's horrid behavior is pure jealousy, or maybe confusion surrounding your actions. I feel the same way as them sometimes. I've seen pictures of transgender men pre- and post-transition (including in /r/transtimelines), and I hate to admit this, but there's a big part of my brain that looks at their beginning pictures and wonders why they would ever want to get rid of what they have at the beginning. I  almost  understand why people can be so transphobic to both trans men and women. I look at those pre-transition transgender men, and they tend to look almost exactly the way I feel I should look. I have to remind myself that they feel the same way about their female bodies that I feel about my male body. It's a very simple, reptilian-brained response to watching them transition from female to male, and I wish I never had these feelings. I understand  why  I feel this way, but I wish I didn't feel this way (but I'm transgender. I wish I didn't feel a lot of ways.  Sigh .). \n The difference between me and these transgender women whom you're having a problem with is that I  don't  voice these feelings. I suppress them, because, although my feelings of confusion are valid, they're pretty easily explained (\"transgender men feel the same way about their bodies as transgender women, just the other way around.\"). I have to remind myself that they feel the same way about their female body that I feel about my male body. I've trained myself to immediately remind myself of this, so much so that I think this instinctual confused response is almost unnoticeable at times. I would  never  say the kinds of thing that these transgender women say to you to a transgender man, because I remind myself that you dudes feel the same way about transitioning that I do (seriously, transgender women and transgender men are almost identical). \n The problem is that the transgender women you're dealing with... aren't doing that. They're using that reptilian, instinctual response that they've had since they were four years old, wondering why anyone born biologically female would want their boobs cut off, or why they'd ever get their hair cut short. Wondering, really, the same things that most cisgender people wonder about transgender women (why would that dude want to cut off his dick and grow boobs?). These transgender women don't censor those thoughts, and they might not even realize that they're wrong (even though they totally should). \n This is absolutely not your fault.  These trans women suck. You're awesome. You're doing nothing wrong. Keep being you. \n My only decent advice for you is to search for a different community. You've already found one here in /r/ftm, and you've got the rest of reddit's massive collection of trans*-related subreddits, so that's pretty cool. But try looking for other support groups in your area (if you live in/around New York City, PM me!). Look for other trans -related groups near you, either on or off Facebook. Meetup is pretty useful! And if there aren't any more accepting trans\\ -related groups, you might have to search for a group that's specifically just for transgender men. Which sucks because it'd be cool for you to make some friends who are transgender women. We need more cross-gender friendships! At the end of the day, we all experience very similar struggles and successes and hardships and whatnot. We're all each other's transgender brothers and sisters.": "ftm",
            "You're your own harshest critic. You're already passing pretty well, really. You've got the cutest smile I've ever seen in this subreddit. Honestly, your only problem (besides your eyebrows, which someone else has mentioned) is that your hair is so short. It's not quite short enough that it'll make it really hard to pass, but it's certainly not helping. \n The only solution is to just not get a haircut for a while. It already looks cute, but a few more months should help with it a lot. \n Also, you definitely need to leave the glasses on. They help you pass and make you look more feminine. Your pictures with the glasses on looked very feminine, and then you took them off and suddenly looked more male. Leaving them on will help a lot. (I have to do the same thing; if I take my glasses off, I suddenly look a lot more male. It sucks but I can't really see that well without glasses anyway so it's not bad.) \n Besides those, though, you really look great!": "transpassing",

Tumblrinas are just the 2014 equivalent to the 90s radio shock jocks. \n People who say that people who oppress them should die are just as bad as their oppressors. \n And if I deal with one more trans-ethnic or trans-species person, I'll smash my head through the wall. Transgender people actually exist. The entire medical profession is in complete agreement on this. The evidence is overwhelming and growing every day. Transgender people's brains literally work the same way as their cisgender counterparts' brains in MRIs. But, no, you're not a trans racial butterfly. You're not a cat.

            "I'm probably too late for many people to see this, but I'm bored so I'll share. \n My story's a bit different from the other women in here. I realized that men see women sexually when I was something like 12 or 15 or whatever, because I was one. I'm a transgender woman, which means that I was born biologically male but am now transition to living as a woman. I lived the first 20 years of my life living entirely as a man. \n I was riding a train home very late (around 11:30-ish PM) on a Sunday. I'd taken my normal spot on the trains, in the window seat of a two-seater in the last car of the train. I noticed that we were about to get to my station, so I got up and started walking forward. \n Between my seat and the exit were about three men, probably around 40 or 45, and clearly kinda drunk. One was in a two-seater, the other was in the three-seater next to him, and one was standing in the aisle. I started walking towards them, clearly intending to pass them to get off the train. \n I'd walked past people on trains literally thousands of times as a man (and a few times as a woman) without an issue, but this time the guy in the aisle gave me trouble. \n First, as I walked toward him, he didn't move out of the way. I'd  never  seen that before from anyone. People standing in the aisle always move out of the way of someone walking through it. I twisted my body to pass him without him moving, and after I was halfway done passing him, he said sarcastically, \"Oh, I'm sorry, was I in your way?\" \n I ignored him. \n By the time he finished the sentence, I'd already passed him, so I figured that creepy interaction was over. He turned back to me and said \"It was nice having you on the train!\" \n I ignored him. \n I walked toward the door to the vestibule, and right before I pressed the button to open the door, he yelled back one last thing. \"Hey, don't ignore me!\" \n I ignored him. I was almost out of the train. I think I heard him yell \"Bitch!\" but I'm not sure. \n I'd always known that men looked at women sexually; I'd looked at women sexually for nearly a decade. But I'd never catcalled a woman. I'd never even spoken sexually to a woman unless I was dating her, but I'd known since puberty that men looked at women sexually. I'd even known that women got catcalled and harassed in public. Having it actually happen to you is something new, and it's terrifying. I knew that this one man wasn't a huge threat; he probably wasn't going to try to hurt me, and he was probably too drunk to hurt me anyway, but that didn't make it not terrifying. \n Bonus fun fact: This happened on March 29, 2015, just 12 days ago.": "AskReddit",
            "because they thought that I (MtF pre-hormones) was a woman when I was trying to enter the men's room in boymode! \n It's happened three times in the last few weeks! Last week I tried to use a men's room in a busy train station and a station employee yelled \" ma'am \" at me until I turned my head. He pointed toward the ladies' room and didn't acknowledge anything I said until I pointed to the sad bit of peach fuzz I call facial hair that I have (I usually let it grow out a bit so that I look as male as possible for now) and said \"I'm a man\" a few times, which kinda sucked to say but I had to say it since I was trying to use the men's room (I looked feminine from a distance, but I had enough facial hair that there's no way I'd be able to get into the ladies' room, plus I wasn't even trying for girlmode that day). \n And then a few days later in a different train station, a regular guy in the men's room said \"uh, miss? Miss?  Miss? \" to me until I turned and said in a deep voice, \"sorry, I just look like a woman from the back; it's just the long hair; it's cool; don't worry about it!\" \n Then at  another  train station, as I was entering the men's room, another regular guy started repeating \"you can't use this bathroom\" to me. I saw some construction workers in the bathroom working on installing some new urinals so at first I thought he meant that the bathroom was closed, but after I saw some men going in and out of stalls, I just kinda ignored that guy and walked in. He made a confused grunt and walked out. \n I've grown out my hair a lot (my last haircut was December 2013) and now wear a more feminine coat and more feminine glasses, and I'm short-ish (5\"6.5'), so from a distance people are gendering me as female. Which is cool, except for when I really gotta go pee. Then it's just moderately annoying since I just want to go to the bathroom without anyone talking to me. But it's the coolest validation in the world to be yelled at by strangers for trying to use the men's room when I'm in boymode.

            "This post will be updated as the battle continues. Stay tuned. \n \n So, following the ending of Chapter 354 chapter, we've been introduced to basically a game changing fact in the Hisoka/Chrollo fight: \n Gallery Fake Bodies affixed with Sun and Moon signs don't disappear and are maintained even if there is no bookmark or open page on Gallery Fake itself. \n We will get to the analysis of this statement, but let's go over the current situation so far.Below is basically the entire fight maintained by the constraints of what each chapter told us. \n \n Stage 0: Chrollo sets the initial conditions. \n Chrollo reveals: \n NEW ABILITIES: \n \n Black voice: Credits to /u/MDman23 for the correction. \n \n The two physical antenna, and the device  are not conjured using the book . When he uses the book, Chrollo is activating the stolen hatsu from Shalnark to channel manipulator type nen to the physical devices. \n \n \n Gallery Fake: \n \n Creates perfect copies of inanimate objects. Can't recreate nen. Nor can it recreate living beings. Copies of living things result in corpses. \n \n \n Order Stamp: Thanks to /u/ghost-pacman4 for the correction on definition of a puppet. \n \n Can only control puppets. Corpses do not qualify as puppets.  But, corpse copies made using gallery fake qualify. \n While Chrollo sees no distinction between corpses and puppets, the original owner did and this rule must be followed. \n The original owner's definition of puppets also required that their heads be attached, which is another condition. \n \n \n \n \n Convert Hands: \n \n Needs to be bookmarked for both hands. Right hand gives others user's appearance. Left hand allows user to take on another's appearance.  Appearance applies to Clothes as well , as shown by Ch. 354, where when converted hands is released, the subject returns to their original clothes. \n \n \n Sun and Moon Signs: \n \n Can place signs on anything user touches. One had applies the moon mark and the other, the sun mark. Once both marks touch, an explosion occurs. \n \n \n \n \n \n Stage 1: Hiding and preparing \n \n Escape in the audience. \n Book mark Black voice and throw 2 Black voiced audience members at Hisoka to distract him \n Activate Convert hands to disguise himself \n Move bookmark to Convert hands \n Release Black voice \n Hide and wait. \n \n \n \n Stage 2: Creating the Puppet Army and Issuing Orders \n \n Steal clothes from a person \n Take bookmark off Convert hands. Appearance returns to his own. \n Bookmark Gallery Fake. Open book to Order Stamp. \n Create fakes and order a portion of them to \"break Hisoka\". \n From here onwards, play hit and run to wear down Hisoka as Hisoka has to deal with the swarm of Puppets \n \n \n \n Stage 3: One on One with Hisoka. \n \n \n Stage 4: Chrollo eyeing to loop Stage 2 \n Hisoka has basically killed off all puppets that have been ordered to \"break\" him, with the exception of one in order to keep an eye on if order stamp is still active. \n \n like Hisoka said, Chrollo, who is hiding in the crowd right now, has currently active: \n \n gallery fake on bookmark \n order stamp on open page \n \n \n Chrollo, right now, is supposedly trying to set up for STAGE 2 again and as Hisoka said, can: \n \n give out orders to puppets in reserve \n release the stamp to make more copies since it needs two hands, and after that \n \n book mark Gallery Fake and use the open page for: \n \n convert hands to hide again  \n order stamp to \"break Hisoka\" \n If this is successful, Chrollo has successfully looped STAGE 2. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Stage 5: Hisoka's rushing in to stop Chrollo from looping STAGE 2 \n \n Hisoka rushes into the audience and currently assumes that there is only the bookmark on Gallery Fake. \n \n Hisoka uses midranged Bungee Gum + Puppet Head as a way to: \n \n get moderate damage in \n keep Chrollo on the move, and not give him time to use Gallery Fake more \n keep a distance to be less vulnerable to Black voice \n \n \n Chrollo currently does not have the same mass of puppets to fully execute STAGE 2 again, so his options are: \n \n hide the book in his jacket and open to Black voice and control people who are not fakes \n open to order stamp and order the remaining copies to attack Hisoka \n \n \n \n \n \n STAGE 6: The truth is revealed \n After Hisoka grabs onto Chrollo with Bungee Aura and crushes his body with the head, but it's not Chrollo. It's not a fake either. It's an audience member made to look like Chrollo with Convert hands and controlled with Black voice. \n But if two abilities are on at the same time, shouldn't Gallery Fake's puppets have disappeared? Nope. The head, which Hisoka used a weapon didn't dispel even though it's from Gallery Fake. Which means... \n SUN & MOON MARKS MAINTAIN GALLERY FAKE PUPPETS EVEN AFTER BOTH ABILITIES ARE NOT ACTIVE. \n \n \n Now, what this means is that for the entire time from Stage 2 to Stage 4, Chrollo was not forced to maintain Gallery Fake along with Order Stamp. The Gallery fake puppets were already maintained by Sun and Moon marks. So, this is actually what he did in Stage 2. \n \n Book mark Gallery Fake, and make tons of puppet fakes. \n Open page to Sun and Moon mark, and mark the made puppets. \n Note: With the book open in the right hand, he can only apply the sun mark. \n \n \n Bookmark order stamp, puppets will be maintained due to having the sun and moon mark. \n Order initial wave of puppets with Order stamp to break Hisoka and  steal somebody's clothes. \n Begin hit and run strategy while puppets occupy Hisoka. \n \n So, this means he only had to bookmark Orderstamp during Stage 2, and could have any other ability active by flipping to the page on the book, but what options does he have: \n \n Sun and Moon marks: Useless because the puppets already have the Sun mark from the left hand, and he can't use the moon mark without bookmarking the ability, but he doesn't want to do that without releasing Order Stamp. \n Black Voice: It's likely, but, also risky. He only has 2 antennas. \n Gallery Fake: Useless without releasing Order Stamp first. Takes two hands, and bookmarked to use. \n Convert Hands: Left hand open, which makes this very useful. He can take on the appearance of anyone. Since, there are puppets already beside real ones, he can blend in by pretending to be a freshly made puppet and stand beside the original. \n \n **Credit to /u/ItsLoudB for this insight. Highly unlikely, but this is the only time in the battle where Chrollo can pull off both sun and moon marks on the puppets. Here it is: \n Possible Stage 2 \n \n Book mark Gallery Fake, and make tons of puppet fakes. \n Open page to Sun and Moon mark, hold the book in the right, and mark all puppets with the left sun hand. \n Move the bookmark to Sun and Moon. Close book. \n Use both hands of Sun and Moon to apply both marks. \n Move the bookmark to Order Stamp \n Order puppets to: \n Break hisoka. \n When certain conditions are met such as proximity to Hisoka, touch the two marks together. \n \n \n \n \n \n So, after Chrollo jumps back into the crowd in Stage 4 after Hisoka kills all but one of this ordered puppets (and also marked by the sun mark), he  creates the fake Chrollo using Convert hands and black voice \n - \n UPDATED STAGE 4* \n 7.Release the order stamp. \n 8.Put book mark on convert hands, and open the page to Black voice \n 9.Put an antenna on an audience member \n 10.Use Convert Hands to give the audience member the appearance of Chrollo \n 11.Hold book with other hand and use the other Convert hand side to change his own appearance \n Thanks to /u/Ikalgeaux for reminding me that Chrollo can only use his left convert hand while holding the open page of Convert Hands, and needs to bookmark it to use both. \n Correct Order \n 6.Hide again in the audience. \n 7.Release the order stamp. \n 8.Bookmark Convert hands and either: \n \n use both hands and swap appearances including clothes \n \n Then steal another set of clothes \n \n \n use only the right convert hand and give the audience member his appearance including clothes \n \n Then steal another set of clothes \n \n \n \n 9.Flip book page open to Black voice \n 10.Stick an antenna in the audience member with his appearance \n \n \n Now, he sends the fake Chrollo to where he would expect Hisoka to think He would hide. Proceed to manipulate the fake Chrollo using the Black voice page that is opened, allowing him to die to Hisoka. \n 12.Hide in the audience and send the black voiced Fake Chrollo be found by Hisoka and attacked.  Notice how after this point, Fake Chrollo doesn't show his book, because the fake Chrollo can't use his nen and instead keeps his hands in his jacket to bluff it. \n 13.Make the black voiced audience member put his hands in his jacket \n 14.Let the black voiced audience member die to Hisoka. \n 15.Take bookmark off Convert hands, and flip away from Black voice, since the main fake Chrollo is already dead \n 16.LITERALLY ANYTHING ELSE, since both hands are free \n 17. Thanks to /u/gazeintotheiris for the input.  In order to blow up the puppets, both marks have to be applied, so Chrollo is probably running around applying the Moon mark using a bookmarked Sun and Moon. \n \n But, that would also necessitate new ordering beyond the simple \"break hisoka\". He would have to input \"break hisoka, and before death run towards Hisoka, and touch the two marks together. \n \n \n \n Chrollo, even at this point, is still playing with Hisoka. He released the bookmarked convert hands just as Hisoka killed the fake Chrollo just to show that it was fake. At this point, it's quite open for Chrollo, convert hands has been released, and there's no immediate need for Black voice as the black voice controlled fake Chrollo has just been killed. \n Anyways, just my two cents, but we'll see how things pan out next week.": "HunterXHunter",

            "So there's something bugging me about Itachi... Before I mention it I need to say that I'm only at chapter 551 so it might be something explained later or maybe it was already answered here but I couldn't find it. So, what is bugging me is... I already know all of Itachi's intentions to protect his brother and the leaf, including his first approach with Kisame to capture the Nine-Tails. But, if his real intentions on that approach were to threaten Danzo, why did he simply followed Naruto to Shukuba Town? Was it only to keep his cover or did he had another intention behind it? If it was only to keep his cover I don't think it was a good plan, since Akatsuki's goal with the jinchuriki could possibly harm Sasuke in the future. I recall seeing somewhere (although I can't find any sources of it) that he wanted to protect Naruto, but if he was going to capture him and deliver him to Akatsuki that's not a very good protection. There is a last possibility that he only cared about Sasuke and nothing else, but that doesn't seem true since he did so much to protect the leaf, and as I said retrieving Naruto to Akatsuki could also harm Sasuke. So what are Itachi's real intentions in his first approach to the leaf?": "Naruto",
            "Basically the Homunculus were created from human transmutations, but in the anime, not every of their creations is explained. So, how were the remaining Homunculus (Gluttony, Greed and Pride) created? I saw the wiki page but couldn't find answers apart from being created by Dante, but they probably result from a failed transmutation, right? So there is most likely not a canon answer to my question, but is there any plausible theory or something? Also, the Homunculus are meant to represent one of the seven deadly sins, but I fail to find the connection between Trisha and sloth... The wikia has an explanation for that, which says she didn't kill her sons and friends whenever she had the opportunity, also she only attacked with one arm while the rest of her body kept immobile. And the water powers coming from a current never flowing its path. Honestly, I don't think this is a plausible explanation for her sin or her power. Not killing her sons might be due to the fact she still holds memories about them, or they might even be a weakness to her. Neither does staying idle while attacking means she represent sloth... she has long range abilities it's no use to get into melee range when she is stronger in a wider range. And if her enemies can't reach her, there is no need to keep moving. Personally, I think she should be Pride, but the Fuhrer would not give a good Sloth either... Apart from Sloth, the other Homunculus are a better representation of their sins, at least imo. So, what do you think about Trisha being Sloth? Is there any other evidence that she is a good representation of Sloth?": "FullmetalAlchemist",
            "So, recently I was discussing the ending of the anime with a friend of mine, and I started wondering which deaths were actually necessary for the plot progression and which deaths could have been avoided. I will just state my opinion but I would like to see other opinions and eventually the discussion of several opinions. So... \n Sheele:  Necessary. I think someone had to die at that moment and it was either Sheele or Mine. Mine had more importance to the story than Sheele could possibly have so I guess it was necessary. \n Bulat:  Necessary. Tatsumi could find another Teigu suitable for him, but I think Bulat's death not only gave Tatsumi a teigu, but it also made him work harder to be better than Bulat. \n Stylish:  Necessary. If he didn't die right there, he would probably come back with the location of Night Raid's hideout which would end the story... \n Bols:  Undecided. I guess this is kind of a middle term, he killed so many innocent people before having his family but later he doesn't look so dangerous and he was probably only following Esdeath's orders. \n Chelsea:  Necessary. It was either Chelsea or Kurome, but Kurome still had an important role in the story. Still her death could have not been so rude... \n Seryu:  Necessary. After what she did to Sheele she had to be punished. \n Lubbock:  Necessary. They got caught by the Empire's stronger generals, no way he could escape (unfortunately...) \n Syura:  Unnecessary. In the anime his actions are not as evil, and I don't think it was much relevant for the plot progression even though he deserved it... \n Budo:  Necessary. If he was still alive, Night Raid would probably not raid the capital to take down the Empire. \n Susanoo:  Necessary. It was either Susanoo or Esdeath would probably take down one or two other members from Night Raid (if not more) \n Mine:  Unnecessary. Her death was kind of weird and it was totally unnecessary. Sure, it might have totally changed Tatsumi's mind, but she didn't have to die, she could have just got the manga treatment... \n Kurome:  Necessary. It was really important for the plot progression in the anime. \n Tatsumi:  Unnecessary. Super Sayian Tats could stop the Shikoutazer by himself. If some other strong characters joined him, maybe he could have survived. \n Esdeath:  Necessary. I don't think I even need to explain this one... \n Leone:  Unnecessary.

That was before last chapter though... things now shine brighter for Tatsumi as we see a chance of seeing him alive after the final war. What is bothering me right now is, what about Akame's fate? \n Don't get me wrong, I really liked to see Kurome surviving and to see the sisters reconciliation but it might have shook Akame's past and future a little bit. She joined the Revolutionaries to overthrow the Empire who stole her sister from her and not just that, but also the lives of many other friends of her. Although it felt a bit rough for her to have to kill her sister (in the anime), the pain she would suffer (if the manga followed the same route) would not only endure her for the final battle but it would also most likely be a trigger for her Trump Card. It's true that the way things are going, the one who will face Esdeath will most likely be Tatsumi so Akame won't have a really tough fight in her way, but it's also quite bothersome to see her lose her shine. If the story follows the fans favourite theory, we will see an happy ending for Tatsumi and Mine, Leone and Kurome and Wave (once again, don't get me wrong I too want an happy ending). In this situation, it feels like Akame doesn't have a place. Everyone is paired with their beloved ones (Leone just needs booze and parties) and Akame is just left alone. She could eventually wander around to end up the remaining opposition but it would not be the best ending for her character to curse her with a life of assassin while her friends have an happy ending...

Then, I red the chapter of Ikusatsunagi and I remembered God Slayer Magic. First of all I'm assuming that God Slayer Magic is the magic used to kill these war gods (which might not actually be the truth). But assuming that the above sentence is true, and seeing that one of the Avatar (Zeref follower) could summon a war god, there is a possiblity that in the final battle, not only dragons and demons get involved but also war gods. Also thought that Erza could take the role of slaying war gods in that battle, while Gray takes demons and Natsu taking dragons. Then I thought Erza could get a God Slayer Magic in the future that allows her to use God/Goddess armors.

            "If abortion is murder, what does it matter if the woman was raped? It's doesn't matter. Not even a little bit. If you allow abortion only in the case of rape, why? Completely illogical. \n Assuming that 'abortion is murder' for the moment, oftentimes it is (at lease plausibly) morally permissible to murder people, such as permitting abortion of fetuses that are not viable outside of the womb before they come to term. Under a utilitarian calculus, this reduces a great deal of suffering that could have been inflicted on the mother and father. \n Thus, we can ask the rhetorical question: if we allow abortion only in the case of unviable fetuses, why? The answer is as follows: because it is morally permitted, while it may not be permitted in other cases (again, this is assuming that 'abortion is murder' is true). The same is true of abortions in the case of rape: Judith Thomson's paper, 'In Defense of Abortion', for example, makes a case that must be reckoned with (you may not find it compelling, but that does not mitigate the fact that it is a strong moral case made in defense of abortion). \n In summation, no, it does not seem 'completely illogical'; rather, individuals accept a different moral calculus than you, and calling this acceptance of a different moral calculus, one that is perfectly in line with mainstream views in ethics 'illogical' is grossly unfair to positions that you disagree with--in other words, your words reflect your personal dislike of a stance, tantamount to saying, 'Boo! Bad!' rather than a supposed  reductio . \n >The idiots with the hand wringing are just as bad as the Taliban. \n Hyperbole much? \n >From a utilitarian perspective, keep using the remains. \n From a naive utilitarian perspective, yes, one could argue that the remains should used; however, more nuanced versions of utilitarianism may argue that the unintended consequences of their use without respect for these individuals, such as a growing distrust of the medical profession, will lead to legal or public condemnation of the medical profession, and a marked decrease in the number of bodies allotted to dissection. Thus, with continued reflection, this course of action may not be the best possible choice. \n There is also the significant psychological trauma visited on family members that feel that the deceased's body has not been given respect, which must be taken into consideration under utilitarianism, and weighed against the positive outcomes of the research, even if you personally believe that the dead should receive no consideration. What difference in outcome is there, for example, for a person to die at a ripe old age in a hospital room surrounded by their loved ones and, all things being equal, that same person at the same age dying in a horrible, violent murder? The person has died. So what? The rhetorical question is answered as follows: the second-hand psychological torment inflicted on the murdered person's family and friends is massive, with no sense of closure. \n >Oh well, superstition, magical thinking, and irrationality win again. Nothing new for humanity. \n Can you explain how respect for the dead is 'superstition'? Ceremonies such as Tombs of the Unknown Soldiers across the world, in America, the UK, France and elsewhere surely do not obviously rely on 'superstition' or 'magical thinking' in their respect for the dead; instead, they serve a significant public service in remembrance for soldiers that need not have died, and a call for no more future war.

Besides this, if we are assuming that functions are qualitatively identical, i'm not sure if there is a difference? \n >Would you still have the same rights and legal responsibilities? and Would the rights only apply to the original? \n Well, there are two factors from what I can see that would affect this, philosophical and sociological. Although we are all humans, both philosophy and sociology would say that younger humans do not have qualitatively and quantitatively identical rights and legal responsibilities. Sociology would say that human of the same age, but different heritage have different rights and responsibillities, while philosophers may not say that, prima facie, unless we are doing social philosophy (which is a response to social injustice). So, perhaps philosophically, these humans are equally \"humans\" as you and I are, but society may impose a different law from the mere fact that some/all of their brain is not neurons. (however if we create machines that use neurons, glial cells, and grey matter...). \n >If a copy of yourself committed a crime, who would be held guilty? \n Unless there is some complication that I am not aware of, I don't see how the original is responsible... unless there is some causal relation between the two? This seems like a elaborate case of your child causing some misdemeanor and somehow it goes on your record... \n >Would we end up with a legal gray area, and a class of second-class citizens/slaves who did not have the same legal protections as their originals? \n I mean, we've always had this so I don't see it as a problem (no more than it already is a problem). It is a problem because, I speculate, that we have preconceived beliefs of what humans should be like. \"They should be white\", \"They should be heterosexual\", \"They should have biological brains\", \"They should have matter\", \"They should be comprised of vibrating energy\". None of these really has any objective weight, not more than what we decide to put upon them. It's just as whimsical as fashion; \"We should wear hide\", \"We should wear chitons\", \"We should wear a toga\", \"We should wear valinciennes\", \"We should wear baggy pants\", et cetera...": "askphilosophy",

The comment (A) says nothing about morality. You're making some remark about a scientific discovery and some opinion about optimal nutrition. the second paragraph of comment (A) talks about \"life\" and how we can't live without taking life.

Okay, with this development, feel free to disregard the first part.

If I hold 1 bag at a time, it will take me 4 trips from my car to my house to finish unloading. If I hold 4 bags at a time, it will take me 1 trip. According to this theory of unloading-from-car, if I hold more, I will travel less. \n Notice that that said nothing about morality. You have to somehow connect \"saving money\" with \"more moral\".

Some of it is cultural too - but does cultural mean artificial - I don't think those two words are equivalent. I think the fact that we have language and can and do talk to each other about we should do has had a huge effect on humanity - both by magnifying moral judgements by alowing them to be public - genes for being a martyr can survive much better if you can be famous for being the martyr's cousin, and by shaping them and analysing them. \n > Is there really anything to the idea that a person should behave any way toward another besides a set of particularly rigidly enforced opinions? \n You seem to have phrased that a little oddly, so I'll reply in multiple ways in the hope of catching the intended question.. \n I'd say it's more to do with our feelings of compassion, hope, anger, disgust, comeradery.

If our worldview has demonstrated itself to be useful then it is worth defending.  However, not all of the information we receive is reliable.  Humans are not rational creatures, nor are we particularly adept at discerning truth from falsehood.  Both of these take training to overcome, and even then the most rational and scientific people are still plagued by significant lapses in judgement. \n Given how unreliable our understanding of the world may be, there is still one definitively real metric of the validity of our worldview: does it work?  By that I mean \"has my understanding of the world enabled me to live the life I want to live?\"  If it has then it works for me, and as such is worth defending. \n So now we have the recognition that our interpretation of new information has a significant change of being totally wrong, and a worldview that has shown itself to be useful.  If someone else points to some new information and says \"change your worldview\" then you're faced with a dilemma.  The information you are receiving has two serious points of error: 1) The information presented by the person could be warped by any number of factors, ranging from innocent mistake to intentional misinformation.  2)  The information as you interpret it could be warped by many factors as well, including innocent misunderstanding and any number of unconscious 'framing' of information. \n Given this, defending an irrational world view is instrumentally rational, since it is erring on the side of caution.

            "I don't eat meat and my reasons for it seem different from most, since when I discuss it with others they tell me they haven't heard this argument against eating meat. \n In recent years there have been more and more calls from scientists to treat some animals as non-human persons.  Those that have been proposed as having person-hood aren't animals we typically eat, like dolphins, chimpanzees, or elephants, but this raises an ethical problem as to what we define as person-hood.  We're only just beginning to understand the human mind and the conscious experience, and from what I can tell the difference between our conscious experience is not radically different from those of other non-human persons.  We do have more advanced language, technology, etc., but they often share our emotional spectrum.  Elephants can suffer from PTSD, have cultural heritage passed down through generations, nuanced communication that we don't fully understand, etc. \n Considering what we do know and that it indicates there is an enormous amount we don't know about the conscious experience, I do not know where to draw an ethical line about the moral rights of animals.  It seems clear to me that most insects do not qualify for person-hood, but as we get closer to humans biologically the distinction becomes less clear.  Chickens are profoundly stupid but can certainly experience pain and pigs are surprisingly intelligent.  Does the capacity to feel pain and/or human like emotions confer moral status? \n I think the answer is yes, but I do not know where the line lies between those who have moral rights and those that do not.

Since I don't know which animals qualify as persons and which do not, I choose to draw a hard line that it's wrong to eat any animals.

            "Yes, it certainly is.  The racial component alone is huge, [every 28 hours a black man is killed by cops, security guards, or Zimmerman type vigilantes.](  In Ferguson, there are [more arrest warrants issued every year than there are people.](  There is almost zero accountability, even in the most [horrific cases](  The racism within police departments is so prevalent that they sometimes [try to kill black police officers]( and there are still zero repercussions.  Every time a police officer gets away with killing someone it sends a message to all other cops: you can get away with it too. \n The prison industrial complex is enormous as well, and the arrests of people of color are astoundingly prevalent.  The USA has ~2.3 million prisoners, most of whom are black.  We have more prisoners than China, a full 25% of the world's total prison population lives in US prisons.  Prisoners are exploited as a source of cheap labor since the 13th amendment [allows forced labor (slavery) for those convicted of a crime.](  This has been [explicitly admitted]( by government agencies.

There was no indictment for the cops who [threw a flashbang into a baby's crib]( and the state is refusing to pay medical bills.  All of this is happening while police departments are being [given military weapons and vehicles]( at an alarming rate.  The cops who use these weapons and vehicles have almost zero training on how to use them.  They are told that they are warriors in the war on crime or the war on drugs, the implication there is that [civilians are the enemy.]( \n The attitudes that cops have about all of this are terrifying, [here's an infographic]( that gives a decent summary.  They believe that you should do what they say no matter what, and if you don't then [it's your own fault if they shoot you.]( \n [The US crime rate is at an historic low but killings by cops are continuing to rise.](  In Utah, [homicide committed by cops outnumbers all other types of homicide.](  Cops are even [killing children]( who are only [holding toys]( It seems like the first thing they reach for is their gun when it is [absolutely clear that they could have used a tazer or pepper spray.](  This problem is probably a lot worse than we know, since we don't have accurate numbers as [how many people cops kill every year.]( \n Another twist on all of this is [civil asset forfeiture]( which is essentially legalized robbery by the cops.

People openly called themselves fascists in many western nations and it wasn't any more alarming than calling someone a socialist.  (As compared to calling someone a communist, which had very alarming consequences.) \n The fascist generations of western Europe were either slaughtered or directly exposed to the detailed workings of fascism, this contributed to its relative demise in Europe as people were generally more alert towards fascist tendencies.  In the US fascism was never threatened and Americans never saw firsthand how fascism makes itself alluring.  Here fascism survived but it had to be rebranded since the Nazi's had poisoned that word.

Eliminating or marginalizing this surplus population frees material resources to be redistributed upwards, while [incorporating them into the capitalist system]( can achieve the same result. \n The inhuman brutality visited upon the undesirables can only be justified by an extremely powerful and pervasive propaganda machine.  Elements such as an illusory external enemy, restricted freedom of the press, and a high degree of daily comfort combine to foster an abject apathy towards the suffering of a minority of the population.  Similarly the public consciousness must remain occupied elsewhere; foreign conflicts and all the subsequent complications serve as an effective distraction, provided that those conflicts can be [maintained indefinitely.]( \n In Nazi Germany these trends were taken to the utmost extreme, in \"Americanized\" western nations they are met in lesser yet still significant degrees.  Instead of exterminating non-white minorities, they are imprisoned, enslaved, or condemned to inescapable poverty to prevent them from becoming a threat to the dominant order.  Outright war is unnecessary to eat up economic surplus as the machines of war have become so intricate and expensive that vast resources can be plausibly wasted on relatively small conflicts.  This also solves the potential problem of killing all possible enemies, smaller conflicts allow the wanton slaughter of foreigners to be 'rotated' between regions, allowing them to repopulate before being slaughtered again. \n At home, social liberties are allowed in so far as they do not threaten state power.  In fact, internal controversy over non issues (like gay rights) serve as further distractions.  Progress on apolitical social issues creates the illusion of true liberty while channeling rebelliousness in ways that do not threaten the state. \n Moving forward, we can use the above analysis as a lens to examine current trends. \n As industrial efficiency continues to increase, the percentage of the population which can be deemed 'surplus' will also increase.  This means that the base of public support for the dominant social order can shrink without diminishing the strength of the state.  Everyday comforts of those once deemed middle class are no longer necessary to maintain, and illusions of democratic participation can be allowed to fall.  Increasingly [advanced policing technologies]( allow fewer and fewer state agents to enforce state edicts, which also means that fewer people need to be indoctrinated to support the state. \n The state, particularly the fascistic state, protects itself and only those necessary to support itself.

            "I really wish good ideas didn't get nixed just to get more money. \n This is a symptom of capitalism.  I'll try to explain why and how socialism will solve that problem. \n First we gotta clear up our definitions, since capitalism and socialism do no mean what most people think they mean. \n Capitalism is in essence workplace dictatorship, the company is owned by a private individual or group of individuals who can make unilateral and unaccountable decisions about how the company is run.  The employees have to do as they are told or else they might get fired, and generally have little to no input as to how the company is run.  As such, only the interests and desires of the owners are reflected in company policy.  Usually this means profit over everything else, which can lead to good ideas being nixed because they aren't as profitable. \n Note how the  definition  mixed and equated since that implies capitalism is a system which gives people more freedom.  As such, anyone who doesn't support capitalism doesn't support freedom. \n (Capitalism is actually generally antithetical to a true free market, but that's another discussion.) \n Socialism is in essence workplace democracy.  There are many many different kinds of socialism but the central principle to all is cooperative ownership and management of economic enterprise.  At the most basic level this means electing your boss (or firing your boss) and having an equal say with all other employees in how the business is run. \n Note how this does not necessarily imply state control over the economy.  Anarchism is a form of socialism and there is no state in an anarchist society.  It is entirely possible to have a free market within a socialist society. \n So what does this mean about good ideas being nixed in the name of profit?  Well with socialism profit isn't the sole motivator for company decisions anymore.  People want to be paid more sure, but above a surprisingly low income money actually isn't all that great of a motivator.  Generally speaking people want to be proud of what they do, that includes providing a quality service even if it's not as profitable.  Additionally, the profit is that the profit gained by sacrificing quality is only significant when concentrated into a few hands.  So the monetary incentive is even less when the company income is distributed more equitably. \n The good idea sacrificed in the name of profit isn't always part of the company's product or service, often it is part of the income of the coworkers.  Consider a factory with 10 employees and one owner.  If the owner buys new machinery that lets each worker produce twice as much per hour, then the owner has a very strong incentive to fire half of his/her employees and pocket the money that would otherwise be paid out as wages.  (Assuming that the company has already hit market saturation, i.e. market demand has already been met.) \n Now lets assume the factory is run democratically, with the one manager elected by the 11 total coworkers.  They buy the new machinery and now half as much work needs to be done to still meet market demand.  Are half of these employees going to vote to fire themselves?  Hell no, they'll vote to work half as much!  So now everyone at the company works half as many hours as they used to and are all still getting paid the same as they were before the new machinery arrived.  Pretty cool huh?": "self",
            "Ok, I'll give it a shot.  I'm gonna pretend I'm talking to a five year old named Billy to make this easier for me, so I'm not trying to be condescending. \n Alright Billy, you're asking why we should be mad at the bankers who control the biggest banks in the world.  To be honest, it's very complicated and I don't understand it very well, but I'm pretty sure that what we just learned about today is a lot like what happened last year.  Since I know more about last year, I'll tell you what happened then. \n Ok, so about the banks.  Well they have a lot of money, and by a lot I mean a  lot  of money.  Take the biggest pile of money you can imagine, then imagine all of that is a single dollar, and then make another pile as big as you can imagine, all made of that one super dollar.  They have more money than that.  This is going to be important in a bit so remember it. \n These really big banks are important though, they help people across the world do business with each other and without them it'd be a lot harder to buy things from Europe or Asia.  One of the ways they do this is by loaning people money.  When they loan money, they give someone a bunch of money if that person promises to give it back after a while, plus a little extra.  How much extra is called the interest rate.  This is a good thing usually, it helps people buy homes and cars or helps them start a business, but governments use this too.  If our town needs to build a bunch of new schools but doesn't have the money sitting around, they'll borrow money from the banks and pay back some interest.  Again, usually this is a good thing, a town might need a fire station right away but not have enough money saved up. \n So the banks everyone is mad at are the really gigantohuge ones, not so much the bank down the road.  These huge banks have a lot of influence, a lot of people look to them as an example of what  they should do next.  Kind of like figuring out the coolest shoes to wear by watching TV.  The thing is  these banks lied, they lied a lot and they lied often .  If we're still talking about shoes, the bankers came on TV and said that purple shoes are really cool and everyone should by purple shoes.  So a bunch of people go out and buy purple shoes, but it turns out that most people hate purple shoes and blue ones are actually cool.  Why would the banks lie though?  It's because they own the purple shoe companies and made a lot of money selling shoes.  Now a bunch of people are stuck with these ugly purple shoes that they don't want, just because the banks lied and told them that purple was cool.  This wouldn't be a big deal if it were just about shoes, but this is about a lot of money and people need money to buy homes and retire after a long life of work.  But maybe even more important is that towns need money to build fire stations and and schools. \n Ok we're not gonna talk about shoes anymore and most of what I'll be saying isn't quite right.  I wish I had something simpler or more accurate but the lies these banks were telling are so complex that even the experts are having trouble figuring out why they said this lie or that lie. \n Remember those gigantohuge banks?  These are the biggest banks in the world so all of the other banks look to them as an example.  Each bank charges interest on their loans but usually they charge a different amount.  It's important for smaller banks around the world to have a rough idea of how much interest they should charge, that way they're more likely to stay in business, so there's this other guy called LIBOR that they all ask about interest.  The gigantohuge banks all tell LIBOR how much interest they're charging, and he figures out the average and tells all the other banks.  It's important for LIBOR to get honest numbers from each bank as lots of people around the world are depending on him to make smart decisions about lending money. \n The thing is, LIBOR has a bunch of friends at the gigantohuge banks, and he wants to help them out.  So if LIBOR's friends ask him to lie for them because it'll help them out, he'll probably do it.  That's what was happening, a lot, the banks were lying to LIBOR and, even though LIBOR knew they were lies, he told people all around the world that the lies were true.  People all around the world depended on him and he lied to them. \n It turns out that this affected almost everyone in the world, LIBOR has influence for somewhere around ~$800 trillion of investments.  I know, that's such a huge number it's hard to get your head around.  Anyway, it's pretty hard to figure out how it affected this person or that, but we do know how it affected towns and cities.  This is what people are  really  mad about. \n (I'm gonna be butchering the details here, even more than I have already, just to get the general idea so don't crucify me.) \n So imagine our town needs to build a new school, and they have to borrow money to do it.  They go to borrow money from one of the gigantohuge banks, at the interest rate that LIBOR told them.  What if that day LIBOR lies and says the interest rate is a lot higher?  Our town is suddenly paying a lot more interest than they should have, but because they promised to pay they have to.  Basically it's like me telling you that this candybar cost me $5 and you'll have to give me $5 to get it, but I only paid $1 for it at the store.  To be honest, that's not quite what happened, but it's pretty close. \n Now these gigantohuge banks have tricked our town into paying way more money than they should have.  It's not quite stealing, but it's close.  We might get to build that one school, but all the other schools can no longer afford to pay their teachers.  Our town is now having a harder time paying its firefighters and policemen, and we can't fix up the park downtown.  But it's not just our town, it's towns and cities all around the world. \n All this money that they scammed us out of, well that goes back to the gigantohuge banks.  These banks already have piles of money so big we can't even imagine them, and they wanted even more.  No Billy, I don't know why either.  What really gets me though, is that the money they took from our town is money that I gave to our town.  I gave that money so that you could have a better school, so that policemen and firemen would keep you safe, and those banks took that money away. \n They did this to people all over the world, and they didn't just do it to towns.  It had lots of other effects that I don't understand, but it still comes down to them scamming people out of their hard earned money. \n The scariest part of it all though, is what our government is doing about it.  Or really what they're not doing about it.  Our government pretty much said that they are not going to do anything about it, that the people that took all of our town's money are going to get away with it.  They said that if they try to stop the big banks, that the economy will fall apart, that no one will be able to find a job.  Most people don't think that's true, they think that the bankers are just paying our government to let them get away with taking our money.": "TrueReddit"

Of course there are for-profit universities, which have people essentially buying degrees.  But even in legitimate institutions, I feel like the high price tag transforms students into customers, both in the eyes of the universities and even to the students themselves. \n Universities of course want to keep their \"customers\" satisfied and to collect as much tuition as possible.  This leads to lowered admission standards and less rigorous instruction, which allows colleges to keep their retention numbers high while satisfying their clientele.  I've even observed this in students themselves, who display a sense of entitlement because they're paying the professor's salary. \n The market is then saturated with degree-holders, rendering said degrees virtually meaningless and forcing people to pay for even higher-level degrees to stay competitive. \n As things currently stand, anyone can get a degree if they have the money and/or connections.  Going to college is just what is done, whether or not you have the need or motivation, and once you've finished there's the very real chance that you'll find yourself bogged down with student loan and competing for menial jobs that shouldn't require a degree but do anyway. \n In a free system, clear-cut and rigorous entry standards would be what kept people engaged.

My only worry for Cap 2 is the amount of CGI/Destruction that will actually be in the movie. When I read initial interviews from Kevin Feige and the writers saying that the movie would be a \"70's political thriller\" I was overjoyed, thinking we'd all be in for a unique, gritty, and interesting superhero movie. When I watching the trailer, I got even more pumped, if possible, I thought the political questions they brought up were intriguing, the practical fighting between Cap and Bucky looked badass, but then all of sudden the HELICARRIER is crashing down to the ground in a CGI Extravaganza and the stakes (for me personally) were lowered. \n Does anyone else share this sentiment? I feel like Superhero movies are going to crazy with the amount of CGI Destruction needs to take place because the creative teams involved feel like they need to raise the stakes however they can. With that said, I feel like they should take a more grounded approach, especially with a character like Captain America, who really is just a \"roided up\" superhero.

            "I think it's been all but flat out said that we're building toward a Flashpoint type storyline in the show, but being that Flashpoint is a DC Universe shattering event in the comics, we run into some problems when we adapt it into the TV world: \n \n No Bruce Wayne \n No Aquaman \n No Wonder Woman \n TV Budget/limited time frame \n \n Some common fixes to the Bruce Wayne problem people suggest are \"Make Robert Queen Arrow instead of Oliver!\" \n While this would be cool, I think they're going to try to keep any time travel stuff relatively self contained to The Flash, just for the sake of Arrow's not getting sidelined and killing any momentum that show has with what it's doing. \n So here's how I think Flashpoint could go down. Have the expected story points, Barry goes back in time, saves his mom, comes back, the future is different and he has no powers. In my version, Central City is a shit hole, basically see it as Starling pre-Arrow days. I have some other thoughts about maybe Eiling using FIRESTORM as a nuclear weapon type thing and that could be the WW3 replacement for the comics. \n Barry, confused by what happened, decides he needs to find a way to get his powers back and fix what happened. Some plot happens, and instead of seeking out an Arrow/Batman type figure, he has to find the  real  Harrison Wells. In this timeline, the real Wells wasn't killed/absorbed by Eobard, and is getting ready to do his particle accelerator stuff. I think this could be a really poignant way to go with the story as Barry would have to essentially sacrifice the real Wells again when he fixes the timeline. Also some real Eobard action could get thrown in with Matt Lecshter reprising the role. \n I think this type of change is likely, because the producers hinted that we'd be seeing the \"original\" Eobard again, and like I said, it could be a cool way to bring back the original Wells and make it an interesting dynamic between he and Barry. \n Your thoughts on this?": "FlashTV",

He's not a name you've seen 20,000 times on fan casts. \n And the fan casts are actually, I believe, one of the biggest reasons people are upset.

Comic Book fans are probably the hardest group of fans to please, because we all have pre-conceived notions about who we think should portray the character, who should direct, etc, just because these characters are so important to us. \n I completely get all of the points that are against Affleck, some of which I can agree with.

            "Here's everything I found on it: \n In July 2001, Lucas gave his opinion on the matter of what is canon in Star Wars during an interview with Cinescape magazine: \n \u201cThere are two worlds here,\" explained Lucas. \"There\u2019s my world, which is the movies, and there\u2019s this other world that has been created, which I say is the parallel universe\u2014the licensing world of the books, games and comic books. They don\u2019t intrude on my world, which is a select period of time, [but] they do intrude in between the movies. I don\u2019t get too involved in the parallel universe.\" \n The Holocron is divided into five levels (in order of precedence): G-canon, T-canon, C-canon, S-canon, and N-canon. \n G-canon  is absolute canon; the movies (their most recent release), the scripts, the novelizations of the movies, the radio plays, and any statements by George Lucas himself.G-canon overrides the lower levels of canon when there is a contradiction. Within G-canon, many fans follow an unofficial progression of canonicity where the movies are the highest canon, followed by the scripts, the novelizations, and then the radio plays. \n T-canon [5] refers to the canon level comprising only the two television shows: Star Wars: The Clone Wars and the upcoming Star Wars live-action TV series. Its precedence over C-Level canon was confirmed by Chee.[6] \n C-canon  is primarily composed of elements from the Expanded Universe including books, comics, and games bearing the label of Star Wars. Games and RPG sourcebooks are a special case; the stories and general background information are themselves fully C-canon, but the other elements such as character/item statistics and gameplay are, with few exceptions, N-canon. \n S-canon  is secondary canon; the story itself is considered non-continuity, but the non-contradicting elements are still a canon part of the Star Wars universe. This includes things like the online roleplaying game Star Wars: Galaxies and certain elements of a few N-canon stories. \n N-canon  is non-canon. \"What-if\" stories (such as stories published under the Star Wars: Infinities label), crossover appearances (such as the Star Wars character appearances in Soulcalibur IV), game statistics, and anything else directly contradicted by higher canon ends up here. N-canon is the only level that is not considered official canon by Lucasfilm.

            "You've got three major technical challenges: \n \n Security \n Responsiveness \n Stability \n \n It needs to be secure, that should be obvious. It needs to be fast, handling trades in real time. It however also must be stable; losing everyone's money if your server catches fire (or, more likely, has a major hardware failure - although on fire is not unheard of). \n So you need to be thinking about security from the bottom up; brilliant network security is useless if anyone with a paperclip can break into the server room and walk off with the physical machine (yes, really does happen). You also need to get someone who will understand complex threats, some issues are obvious (XSS and CSRF are both fairly well understood now), but for example you shouldn't host the wallets on a VM because of side-channel attacks (  ). You'll want your wallet server isolated from the Internet and relayed through another server so it can't be attacked directly, but also have a cold store wallet (i.e. paper or other physical wallet stored in a vault somewhere). \n Performance/scalability while maintaining stability is the next issue. You need to be able to ensure whatever happens, you don't lose any funds. I'd suggest a message queue (something like  ) to broadcast incoming funds received, trade offers, trades being made, etc., but am somewhat oversimplifying the architecture for that even then. You need to be persisting these changes into a replicated database, so a sudden power/hardware failure can't lose you more money than you can possibly afford to lose. \n Looking at software architects with experience in finance is probably where you would formally look at this.": "dogecoinhelp",

The pay was somewhere between \"very low\" and \"just genuinely offensive\", but this was 2001, UK universities charged up to \u00a31k/year for tuition, and the project paid what it could, rather than what it would have liked to. What I really liked though was that I had the opportunity to make things better, to dig into why university processes were so complex and expensive and try streamlining things. \n Over an extended period of time (small team, and had to do projects that actually paid in between the one I wanted to be on), we eventually expanded across the whole institution (entirely user-led adoption, rather than management led). However... essentially I trapped myself. I was a researcher but didn't have the published papers to move up as a researcher, because I was spending too much time working on the project that actually paid me.

Bad isn't the right term; if I'm ordering a book from Amazon, waiting 30 minutes to an hour for payment to be confirmed is no biggie (although it does need to be a little more fire and forget). If I'm buying something in a shop, it's less good. Payment protocol helps with zero-confirmation transactions, nor are faster confirmation times without their risks (confirmation time affects security relative to wall clock time, not block count), but... well it's still a stumbling block. \n Honestly, I also think at some point a lot of people are going to question (again) why they should pay Bitcoin early adopters orders of magnitude more than their original investment for the coins, and that's going to be disruptive (although I've been very wrong on that before, so maybe I underestimate people's willingness to believe something will increase in value indefinitely).

The technology is rough and having others doing different things (however subtly) in the same space isn't inherently bad. \n Scalability isn't talked about enough, either.

If you can put a unique spin on existing ideas, or come up with relevant, unique treatments of new ideas you'll get higher on the ladder. Having said that, You'll also find that your ideas about how your career progresses will change with the challenges you face, and the strengths you develop on the job. \n You'll have to work from concepts, photo-reference, interpret verbal instruction, and use your own creativity to solve problems.\nYour fundamental modelling/texturing techniques need to be robust enough to move between styles, genres, programs and plugins. \n Tip: don't compare yourself to the average applicant. Compare yourself to an above-average employee.\nthe sense of satisfaction you feel when you achieve a new skill, or achieve successful comparison with an easy target, can dull the need to excell. I've always tried to compare myself to the best I can find - Yes, you have to wait a long time, and work very hard to get close - but ultimately it's a driving force that will take you higher and higher. \n There are great careers to be had, that can afford great lifestyles. after all that's why we do this: to feel purposeful, useful, respected, and to enjoy life. It'll come at a price, though: Low wages at the start, Long hours (if you have a director whose ambition is bigger than their hands-on experience of game-dev), and heavy competition. \n Tip: And this is a bit of a personal perspective that I have, that doesn't stand to be harmful to your prospects. Something I try to encourage in all my students, and people I mentor, is to aim to make (positive) cultural influence with your work, rather than aim simply to make money. The simple tricks you need to use to make money have very short shelf-lives, and you have to change your approach every time - it makes for a very hit-and-miss approach to making profitable art, i think. In the games industry we don't have a freelance culture at the High-End, so you'd be salaried anyway. Aim to make cultural influence, aim to change how people think - Aim to get your artwork into dinner-table conversation of Non-gamers - Aim to get people talking about your work 25 years after its release. Aim to help other people WIN in life with your artwork, and you'll never be short of a job.": "computergraphics",
            "I stayed in university until I was 24, in art/design courses which did give me the letters and the bit of paper.. I gotta say though, the masters course I did gave me a totally different appreciation for academic principles and processes. \n I'm very much of the mind that Formal training in how to get the best out of a brief, where the result is informed by research (both contextual and apposite), is essential if you want to go far in the field. \n Also, the older I get, and the friends I see losing jobs through various reasons; financial mostly, it's becoming more important that the awareness of competitor products/styles and your industry in general, makes for far more unique and desirable work - regardless of the branch of design you're involved with. \n My advice, definitely stick at it. There's a massive sense, especially with design students (true of me, and my cousin, a graphic desiner), that you can conquer the world, and noone can teach you new things; that it's a totally subjective field, and the important aspect of your work comes from within. \n It  can  come from within, but for you to function as a professional for the rest of your working life, there has to be an established formula that you've formed yourself, that you can rely on and apply to your projects when you have a creative block. \n The sense of superiority that my cousin and I felt, went in opposite directions. Mediocre results in college led her to feel misunderstood in her superiority when she was about 19. She left her national diploma course (not quite degree-level) - and she's been fighting for junior roles for the last 20 years (she's approaching 40 now). It however led me through my BA, onto my MA, and into a great career that continues to strengthen ( touch wood ).": "Design",
            "I'm an emotional eater. Not to say I comfort eat, or that I turn to food when I'm depressed, I just take pleasure in eating and drinking nice things. \n In getting over an OCD depression about 7 years ago, one of the measures that I took, was to learn to not be reactionary in the face of things that made me worry. One of the worst things one can do with OCD is react to every question it makes you ask of yourself - to scratch the itch. \n in 2003 my Dad had to have a bypass operation, due to a lifestyle that had contributed to arterial plaque-buildup. He alos had a massive heart attack while he was being worked on, during that op. in short, it was massively traumatic for him, and very emotionally significant for the rest of my family and I. \n BUT. \n The problem with reacting to things like this, and having 'triggering events', is that Emotion is rarely stable. The need to release tension by rebelling (whether that's consciously giving into alcohol, cigarettes, or food you know is bad for you), can pass all on its own if given the chance.  Similarly, the pain from a significant emotional injury or loss WILL HEAL with time, and if motivation for a lifestyle-change comes from that pain, the impetus will disappear with it. \n The approach i've taken is to try to remove excuses to make changes (I love a finely-crafted excuse to avoid something), and make as dispassionate-as-possible decisions toward changing my lifestyle and health-habits. \n I think decisions concerning only yourself made with your intellect, rather than emotions will have longer-lasting results. Also, if successes are hinged on 'triggering events', people looking for inspiration will feel they have to wait for similar experiences, if that is promoted as the way forward. \n The way I figure is: The time will pass anyway, regardless of whether I eat burgers or salad, whether I stay in bed until 9am, or get up at 8am and run 5k. And as I get older, time passes so much faster (results come quicker).": "loseit",
            "Heya DFT - \n I've recently had to address the idea of portfolio design, for my own. \nI'm super-conscious of putting more wordy replies on your posts though.. I\nI'll try to be brief.. lol \n the constantly-scrolling website is a fair idea for a Game-art folio: I've never seen one before (not that I'm the benchmark :P) \n I found the colour of your sub-title type a little jarring. \nthe combination of mid-grey with dots and magenta is really frustrating to read (for me). Also, I absolutely hate how the word 'graphics' escapes your right-hand margin :P \n If you want personal info on your first page, have it as just that: an intro page With a big, obvious link to your work. \n Right now, the type's right-justified.. Either make it really super-obviously right-justified, or make it Centre-justified with equal spaces to the right and left side. Make your background (as someone else here has suggested) light enough to make dark type clear, or dark enough to make light type clear (I'd go for  Light background/Darker type, in this case?) \n Use the website to construct a visual vocabulary and then stick to it with all your work. \n either, have 'open' artwork, where the background colours to renders are the same as the web-page's background (so the artwork seamlessly bleeds onto the background), or create some kind of frame design. \n Just like with game-art, you won't want to 'snap' people out of the experience of viewing your website when they see something jarring. Create a visual language that they can become familiar with on first sight, then display all your stuff (text and images) within that same consistent language. \n this will be the first impression that lots of prospective employers will see.. So work out what you want to communicate about yourself, then be Super-Simple and elegant in communicating it verbally and visually.\nSimplicity is the essence of communication - don't do anything too complex!": "Design",
            "There's plenty of great advice in the other comments, that I won't repeat - the first thing I noticed was that I think the problem is with your content - It's WAY too eccentric for AAA. \n While it's pretty, and apparently well-executed, it's a very marginalising visual style that simply-put, makes it really difficult to hire you. Without wanting to sound disparaging, your style is kinda typical of what someone thinks game-art is like, rather than what it's  actually  like. Games is hard, boring work for juniors - it's not about robots, aliens, grotesques and the surreal. \n Game-art at junior level is Dull, it's monotonous, repetitive, and rarely employs creativity. You have to prove that you're also capable of making crates, bins, lampposts, benches, from photo-reference. For character work, I guess as a junior, you might be asked to adapt multiple character meshes to the same rig, perhaps.. something functional, and cheap. \n The vast majority of companies won't care if you have a deep back-story behind each work, or if you're trying to revolutionise how characters are portrayed in videogames. If you have no experience in Triple-A, and you WANT to work in Triple-A, you'll be hired as a Junior; you should aim for this, and unless you have what they're looking for, you'll be overlooked. \n The bigger companies tend not to want Junior character artists, because Characters work working on in-house are front-and-centre, and they won't usually risk that work on juniors. So you have to prove your worth elsewhere. There are 4 main areas of art-employment right now (for 3D): Environment art, Character art, Vehicular art, and visual effects art. There is Concept art, but your folio's emphasis is on 3D. Your best chance is as an Environment artist. I realise you have a character-heavy portfolio - which you might want to stay dedicated to. \n Environment art also has an experience-relative responsibility scale. Juniors will handle LODding and props - working from concepts, on very short timescales (depending on the outsourcing policy of that company). \n Something crucial, is that companies won't import Juniors from other countries, there's simply too much expense for not enough gain. Juniors are always locally-sourced, so don't look too far for work and expect results.": "computergraphics",
            "It was a result of the approach I took with the folio as a 'thing', the time available, my own skills, my body of work to date, and because of my background. \n The approach I took was to research other Environment Artist portfolios, to see which ones stood out - and none that I found stood out because of the presentation: Plenty had very beautiful work, but were still presented in website form - and it was a job to distinguish. Mine had to appear different/unique - one of the art directors from BioWare remembered me by the 'pretty folio', not by my name or voice. (job done) \n I'd only ever worked on Racing games, and had pretty limited content to show off - so needed something that could excuse 'flexibility' in how i could display artwork. Wipeout tracks out of game-context might not have worked as images on a website.\nHere, there is only one illustration per page, and it goes right to the edge. \n Also, presentation context makes a massive difference to how visuals are perceived. I think it's the reason why game-art isn't gaining recognition as \"high art\" alongside stuff like painting, sculpture, architecture, music, literature, theatre. Strong examples of any strain survive, and survival demands respect. Digital media like games and web, I think, haven't proven their strength in history yet, and Right now, it's too new, but books aren't - so If I can make it appear like a book, maybe I can leech some of that gravitas. \n There was no deadline for the folio, as such, but I didn't want to give more than 3 months to put the work together. I could never learn enough on the web-design/back-end side to make it distinguished enough to my satisfaction in the time - plus, my strengths aren't in UI or interactivity-design. (and I really don't like using stock image-viewers/layouts) \n Most of my education leant toward problem-solving with visuals: graphic arts and graphic design. While I'm probably not very strong with either, I have huge respect for elegance and simplicity of some graphic design (rather than the quite trendy themes of deconstruction, reconstruction and clutter) and that's what I attempted to emulate. Some people really (REALLY) hate century gothic, but with some keming adjustment, I think it's sufficiently simple/elegant. \n So I aimed it toward something like a coffee-table book: something that was a pretty as possible on each page - and was engaging enough to not feel slow or boring - at 88 pages it's fairly long, but I've not had feedback concerned with its duration or pace. \n If you're aware of the concept of the \"4th wall\", every website and portfolio has to break the 4th wall at some point, becoming totally aware that it's communicating directly with the viewer. It's an accepted practice as soon as something becomes interactive or informative. I wanted something that was as self-contained, linear, and non-interactive as possible: something that just 'was', regardless of its audience, at the same time as being totally tailored to the audience. Ideally I wouldn't have had text, but couldn't find an elegant enough solution to describe the technical details about properties and process that I needed it to. My best work is in workflow, and how it can benefit a team,  or a project - that's tough to display without addressing the viewer/reader directly.": "formula1",

I can find tidbits here and there on specific tools/techniques, or if I'm lucky somebody will document their workflow for a shot or two. Even broader stuff like a Luminous Landscape video I watched about processing into black and white seems to be both specific to a small use-case, and within that still very subjective.

Judging one paragraph on a single topic from an entire book with complex subject matter is an egregious assumption of his education and the topic. It is encouraged to test ones point of view, as not to become close-minded. I am interested in the why, not the binary. It depends on your goal and your use case. It comes down to what works best for the design. If you build a product for durability, you have to choose the level of hard/brittle, or soft/flexible. Maybe you need 1.5 en space instead of an full em space. \n Life is not binary, and neither is the history we have been taught. Being well past high school, i have unlearned a lot of 'facts' and history that were once held as truths. A signal and noise issue if you will. Something written by someone is an opinion, just sometimes a very good opinion based off of what they learned (which could have been false)... although it hasn't caused the end of the world, so it might not be a bad perspective on the matter. One size never fits all, as you stated. \n I prefer single spaced sentences for typefaces that have been analyzed/adjusted for spacing. I prefer double spacing for typefaces that look too condensed after sentences. 'White rivers' are bad, no matter if you single or double space... they just are more apparent with the latter. \n Metal type is cast, so if you need spacers you need to get them from somewhere. Which for economical purposes probably only come in two sizes (which thickness of the design could vary from supplier to supplier). The business decision dictates the design decision. It is cheaper to buy lead that can be used for all fonts, than for each individual fonts. \n Typewriters are a product and have a fixed design, so it makes sense to make a change in behavior of the user (typing multiple documents) over adding another key to slow efficiency of said typist. Two quick spaces off of one key are faster than one space from two keys. Also one less point of failure if you only have one key for spacing, and one less key to manufacture/integrate. Which lowers costs. \n Digital fonts can be updated with ease, so it makes no sense to utilize these practices with typefaces that have been corrected for positive/negative ground relationships. [NOT speaking to the quality of the font] Currently on my Windows 8.1 machine, Arial Regular is on version 6.87 [Monotype Corporation]; which shows that the technology media provides the ability for improvements over time that can be made to correct prior technology constraints/decisions. I am more interested in how it works visually and what design decisions i have to make to make it cohesive. \n [Look prior to the use of metal/wood type, these manuscripts have distinctive styles.]( They were probably schools/institutions who taught a certain way, which other schools could have disagreed with; it does not necessarily make it 'wrong'.

Back to the topic though... \n I wasn't debating the truth of the statement. I was pointing out that when others use a sensationalist word that uses polarizing terminology (e.g., patriotism, terrifying, shocking, murderous) to push an agenda, truthful or not, caution should be employed. Propaganda can  be truthful or not; Someone can use any information they chose to push an agenda. Any type of fundamentalism is dangerous, even atheist fundamentalism (that is the best term to parallel idea that i have right now).

Any place will pick your stuff apart. It isn't that your work is bad per se, it is about  continual self improvement  and learning about different perspectives/approaches. Yes some people are completely inept, it is just a fact of life. The flip side is if someone pays for something they shouldn't get something completely different just because you have a vision (Billions of people on the earth, no idea is truly unique). If they  don't want  to hear your guidance/expertise/vision/etc, than they get to reap the consequences... treat them like a informed responsible adult. \n There is a learning curve for everything in life.

            "In my posts when i say \"absolute power\" i have dictatorship next to it. It is impossible for a democracy (shared power) to have absolute power. It is a oxymoron. If you are talking about a democracy that has a coup d'etat that would be different. The overthrow could temporarily have absolute power and then set in place a democracy but that is just splitting hairs. Just because there are check and balances doesn't mean that we  should  feel safe about it. A small group of top officials could make a secret Oligarchy; the idea is plausible. Another example would be using political power to pressure constituents. \n When a president goes with the majority, he is using absolute power because there is no enough opposition to the contrary of that ruling; the morality of the majority is a different question all together. [Such as like over in Africa right now.]( The idea of a majority ruling with values you don't agree with that can persecute you is what some would fear. Those that might trade their freedom for perceived security can lead to the erosion of actual rights; even though on the door it says your all free. Does anybody remember how our own history has been in regards to the minority? Before i catch hell, i love my country and wouldn't want to be anywhere else... i just am not going to try and excuse horrible actions? \n Does anyone remember when we gave smallpox blankets to the indians? Gave them land and kicked them off after we found valuable natural resources, and then relocated them to somewhere else all the while stripping their culture/identity/beliefs away and converting them? Women didn't have a right to vote til the early 1900's? and African Americans? What about a African American woman? We could go on with Civil rights, Gay rights, the internment camps after Pearl Harbor for Asian looking people, or those who were Muslim and jailed for looking Muslim after 9/11?  Electrolytes, because that is what the majority craves. \n Martial Law has been some concerns since it can suspend rights which opens the possibility (however unlikely) of a process to absolute power (and eventually a country not of the people). [Here is a thread that would be more knowledgeable than me.] \nTurkey right now has a whole set of issues related to how the majority wants their government and how those in power would like to have it. \n The abusive power doesn't have to always be negative; there are plenty of politicians that use their power to cut through the politics to help others. They are still abusing their position; even though it helps others (e.g., build roads, create jobs, individual rights). People who are  sociopaths/psychopaths/narcissists  believe they are doing something 'good';  they truly believe it in their minds ; also those types of high profile jobs are attractive for those types of personalities which allows the abuse of power. \n [What about Nigeria?]( Kenya has elected governors and i have heard you can't get anything done efficiently through customs without the need to bribe everyone. \n [ I wasn't talking of \"something\"... i stated very specifically the condition: that someone (a human being that has a known disposition in surviving within their environment) will abuse (take advantage) of their power (serves the self interest of that person and possibly others as long as it satisfies the first condition)  I did not state that 'if' i throw this ball in the air it will 'always' come down. Since that deals with external factors such as gravity/location/attached to something etc... Human behavior is more predictable and has been modeled over enough to show it is inevitable that people will maximize the outcomes of their situation. Before you try the altruism route, let me say that altruists feel rewarded by helping others; it is self serving dopamine response even if it serves others. Mother Teresa is a bad example (before anyone brings it up). \n Ask yourself how many languages are on this earth. How many religions/gods? How big is earth compared to the entire universe? Armed with this knowledge is it possible that this outcome has happened before in over 200,000 years of Homo Sapiens being around each other? Maybe their groups were small democracies? Now compare 200,000 years of which 2500 years is a little over 1 percent (Greek democracy 500 b.c.?)... So can it happen over the next 200,000 years if we are still around? What is the basis of this never happening? Is it because you  believe  it will never happen? Are you just looking for 1 example in 200,000 years of history to change your mind to it having possibly happened or a arbitrary length of time extended in the future? Is the condition  that you are talking only of \"our\" democracy (United States) or of the system of Democracy? How do we know as outside the 'system' whether a charade is being played in front of us or not? How would we be able to tell that someone is ruling with absolute power in a democracy? I am not talking paranoia, just bringing up questions to give personal reflection on the issue. \n [A good read \"The Black Swan\" by Nassim Taleb.]( This topic really doesn't apply, but the fundamental thought is applicable. \n [Read or download the audiobook of Malcom Gladwell's book \"The Tipping Point\"; his other books are awesome also...

            "Seriously, so easy a caveman can do it. \n If you are using Photoshop. Go into your preferences and open up Camera Raw Preferences. At the bottom it will have an option for Tiff and JPEG files. Make sure it says \"Open all supported JPEG/TIFF files...\". Then open up your image. It will open up ACR (Adobe Camera Raw), and you can even open multiple files. If the color cast is from your scanner you can batch them for that specific color cast. Then save them as TIFFs or overwrite the TIFF files. Then open the newly edited tiffs in the ACR again. Color correct each one by using the sliders. Also you can adjust your contrast/exposure/noise reduction/sharpening etc from this step also (cutting down on time spent editing). Then re-save them as TIFF files, then batch a folder for JPEG's. The reason to keep them as Tiff files (if you don't know) is to not do the Lossy Compression that JPEGs do when you save them. Also save the JPEGS at quality level 12 (not 10). Saving a jpegs over the same jpegs is like photocopying a copy... it just looks like crap after a few times. It might also help if it is just for viewing online to do a Save for Web. \n If you feel that the yellows or oranges (whatever) are too  insert any bias color here  than go to the HSL tabs and adjust the Hue for that specific color. Also the saturation or luminosity brightness for that color can also be done separately. \n If you don't have a full copy of Photoshop, download the free 30 day trial. If you have Elements, than you will have to do it the long way with the adjustment layers and tweak it. \n Please use adjustment layers and save as TIFF (or psd) files for archival and non-destructive editing. It makes it easy to change or go back and tweak things. \n Do not convert them to CMYK; It is a smaller color space and your images can lose the larger dynamic color space that RGB provides... plus that is what your scanner brought them in as. \n Infinity_spiral has the next best option as of this posting. \n PM me if you need any more help. If these are film scans it is the route i would take, if they are photographs... i would photograph the photographs (i know it sounds odd as my copy of a copy statement); the reason is that some old images have pebble texture that you can't get rid of from flatbed scanner. Cross light the photograph that is behind glass (to keep it flat) and then make sure the camera is square to it vertically and horizontally. Be at 50 mm or greater with a large f-stop (f-8 or higher). Make sure there is no light coming in from behind you (glare is like a mirror; i prefer a dark room to do this with strobes or even hot lights). Tripod for sure. Shutter release would be very helpful or a 2 second timer if you have long shutter speeds. \n Source: i teach Photoshop if you can't tell": "photoshop"

            "EDIT: I can't find a low cost clinic in Denver that has any openings anytime soon. Does anyone have any ideas? \n Well, guys...here's the long and the short of it. \n Last year in September I was in a car crash. They did an MRI on my spine and sent me to physical therapy. So I did that and came back that December for a followup with my spine specialist (it cost $700! Can you believe that?! Anyway...) he basically told me, here's a copy of your MRI CD. \"There's a mass between T1 and T2 vertebrae (the base of my neck) it might be lymphoma! And fled the room just like that.\" I went home and cried. \n Until now I couldn't go in for treatment, I make less than $600 a month, I live with my parents right now. So I had to wait until they recently expanded Medicaid so I could try applying again. I've been really worried, it's stirring up my depression a lot. To top it off, I'm so damn tired all the time. My back hurts, I have swelling in my tonsils and where the mass is. I'm freaking out. \n My friend has Non-Hodgkin's. His legs are all weak from chemo and radiation. He uses pain meds and smokes MMJ to help, and it does quite a bit for him. But he can't work or hold a job because he's too sick to do anything. We occasionally get him to hang out with us, but I feel myself worrying about both of us. I don't know the full details, but Make a Wish gave him a fancy laptop. He got his cancer paid for by funds. But he's 17 so he can go to Children's Miracle Hospitals and I don't think I can, I'm 20. I'm not a kid. I'm not cute. I'm not unique. Nobody's gonna save me, no one's going to pay for treatment. I'm a worthless college kid. \n So my brother found out last night, he told me to go to a clinic in my area that's low cost. They don't ask a lot of questions, they help you apply for assistance and offer cancer screening. They're federally funded and have nice staff, he says. So I'm setting up an appointment for Monday and making my boyfriend drive me up there. I know if I drive myself, I'll get halfway there, have a mental breakdown, and turn around. I have bipolar depression, this is a seriously awful roller coaster after being stable for a long time. \n Oh, I had leukemia as a kid, I was a year old. My brother donated bone marrow to me and I also had chemo. They said I was cured. St Jude's saved my life, my mom donates every year - we are beyond grateful. We don't live near anymore, I think. I'm in Denver now, instead of Iowa where I was diagnosed as a kid. \n So now I'm nervous seeing the testing options. The websites say they can take bone marrow samples from...my pelvis?! Oh my god. I cringed. I'm not afraid of needles, I give animals shots and draw blood on them all the time, and I get a birthcontrol shot every three months - I even did my own flu shot a couple years! Okay, enough bragging. \n But...a needle? In my pelvic bone? NOPE NOPE NOPE. Needles in bones scare me. After my car accident they tried to give me steroid shots for pain in my shoulder and lower back - the answer was nope! \n Other than that, if I'm diagnosed. I won't be able to afford treatment. My parents are poor right now, my brother moved back in because he's going through a divorce and he uses up our electricity and his kids eat the food here - but it's been great to have his support, sometimes we just stay up and drink and tell stories. It helps the crippling anxiety. \n But who's going to support me financially? I'm no one important. I got zero value if we're being honest. Are there funds for nobodies like me?What do I expect with these doctors? If I get chemo and radiation, will I be able to keep working? I stand all day, what if my legs lose muscle mass and I can't?

We found out I have a tumor on my spine that is growing and may potentially kill me. Fun. I was given medicine and sent home. A few days ago I developed laryngitis and couldn't talk and was feeling very sick - couldn't breathe, massive headache, pain all over, just totally wiped out. This was humiliating, but I lost my voice completely. I had to have my mom call me in. \n On Friday they called me into the office and wrote me up. I told them I had a doctor's note, they shouldn't be able to write me up! No, they still did! So then I asked why it wasn't excused, I was so sick there was no way I would have made it in and encouraging sick employees to work isn't good for our health and can get other employees sick, too. \n They told me only absenses covered by FMLA wouldn't get us written up. They said only if we were caring for a sick child or family member. I don't have kids, so apparently I don't get to be sick and rest! Missing a day is worth 2 points. Being late or leaving early is 1 point. I have four points. That got me a writeup. At 11 points, you get fired. Yet I know employees who are well past that and not caring for kids at home, yet they're still here and one hasn't been written up. \n I hate this job. It seems everyone else gets promoted and when they do good things - they get recognized. I do the same as everyone, pull my weight, and my customer surveys are ALWAYS great. Yet they don't mention it and I don't get any sort of kudos while everyone else is in their own circlejerk I guess. I'm always getting yelled at for stuff that is the managers fault. They don't tell me they want something a special way or the policy changed and it's my fault, I get points taken off the stupid scoreboard in the break room. \n Here's the funny thing. I work a second job at another company and everyone there is super nice to me. They told me they were impressed that little ol' me (120lbs) will unload trucks and work hard while others slack off.

People tell me I'm crazy, but after this summer I rejoice each time there's been a close call to death even if there was a bad injury. It could have went so much worse. \n My aunt Martina's death shook my large family and I, as they were all gathered at my home to celebrate my graduation the next day as they heard the news. Things turned from mass celebration to awful. I was shaken and I have to sit down every time I walk past her memorial in my home. What? Why is her face on that card?

There is nothing worse than losing a loved one accidentally especially on a farm where family farmers must continue their jobs early the next day as a constant reminder of what their activity had contributed to the death of their sister. \n In closing, I would like to remind all reddit farmers the importance of safety and to rejoice at any close call.

            "I had a delightfully set up 20g tank(my fist 'big' tank) and everything seemed to be running quite smoothly.  The contents of said tank were a Rainbow shark, Golden algae eater, a one red and one blue gourami, and a healthy amount of Wisteria. I disappeared for a weekend (2 days, should be no big deal) and upon return had discovered my tank to be rather lifeless.  After having the appropriate fishy funerals, I began to test waters and things as diagnosis. I couldn't find a thing wrong. The water could stand to be softened a tad, but other chemicals were found to be proper.  I took my inquiries to local pet stores and the best thing we could figure is at some point over the weekend the power went out, causing nitrates to rise, and thupon power return filtered it before my check? does that make sense? any other theories out there, before I begin the task of starting the tank over?": "Aquariums",

            "First off, pics soon, i cant find my USB cable. how convenient. \n so as a late present, and also a kick to my own ass (dont know why i didnt think of getting him a planted tank sooner), i got my father a 10g glass tank with florescent lighting. enough lighting with a shallow tank to house easy care level plants. i cycled the tank hidden in my sisters room (im so sneaky), starting with the tetra filter it came with, 9-10g of seachem conditioned water, and black flourite gravel. once the tank was cycled i vacc'ed out the majority of the water, moved the tank into his room with ninja skills (he was out at the time), and then refilled with the SAME water. i also had to do a LOT of small water changes because for some reason all the warnings to the substrates unrinsed cloudiness flew passed my clueless mind. it basically looked like a massive bacteria bloom in there. \n PLAANTS!! \n java fern, anubias barteri, crypt parva, bronze wendtti, crinum (thaianum?), hygrophilia siamensis. for some reason my lfs did not have marimo balls, java moss or hornwort. \n temp is being kept at around 70 degrees, params are stabilized, and still no fish (probably not going to be any for a while). \n now, my father is the green thumb of the family, all over the house are spider plants, orchids (a few different kinds), and randomly a pot of rosemary. over the years hes built and operated his own greenhouse and was able to grow plants worth selling at his old business. the question is, will he be able to apply a lot of his knowledge to non-aquarium plants to these in his new 10 gallon? i waited for him to decide what to do with placement and such so i left the plants spread out still in their pots. he said that there is no need to remove them until the roots have occupied enough space in there first, so that when he finally tears the pots off, there will be a well established root system. my only worry is that, itll be well established in this tiny pot? \n im more worried about the plants that people say to anchor down to rocks or driftwood like the anubias or fern. dont worry, i warned him about which plants will become a rottfest if placed directly into the substrate. \n so what say you reddit? do you think his first tank will be successful or do you think he is in a new world now and needs to go to back to almost basics? i just dont want him to assume anything because of his experience outside of an aquarium. hes never had live plants underwater. his only experience with fish are the two ponds we had (indoor and outdoor), some weird wall hanging tanks he made for me and my sister's early years betta experiences. \n thanks reddit!": "PlantedTank",
            "Hello fellow pilots, \n today is a bad day for me. I have lost my beloved quad. My first brushless build ever and its gone to my neighbourhood somewhere. I was flying around my local baseball diamond and soccer field. I went too high for my skill level and on top of that the sun got in my eyes from lack of eye wear (I am a fucking moron). I heard a loud thud after it went over a tree line which divided the backyards from the park. My buzzer seems to be out of commission, so I am assuming the battery is at least unplugged. I have this sick feeling in my stomach now, and I am also not in the position to build another at the moment. When I am though, I will be looking into key fobs, or anything that does not rely on main flight pack power to actually work. \n It looks like this:  , it just has a normal square shaped top plate as opposed to the one in the photos now. Some of you know that I JUST built this, and I asked a whirlwind of questions to get this done. \n Even though they probably won't see this, thank you to those who helped me already by searching their backyards with me. Even ran into a City Councillor, Tom Muench, who also searched his backyard to help. I feel all is lost at this point, some people here seem to barely speak English as well and may think I am just a door salesmen. I just hope it has not caused any property damage or physical injuries. If I caused that, I won't be able to look at flying or even myself the same. \n Sorry for the rant, all this could have been avoided I know. There is just not many people I can tell this story to, and have them understand to the fullest. Just wanted to let off some steam. God I must have looked like such a creep walking around today. \n Please, if you happen to be in Richmond Hill, Ontario by Crosby Park, let me know if you see it :( There is and will be a reward involved as well.": "Multicopter",
            "Purchased on thursday, dead today (laate sunday)? \n i have to say, the initial experience was awesome. never got any dry hits, and man did it produce some good results in my books. it only has a single hole punched but it is considerably large. i put it into my smoktech tank from happyvaper (Ontario, Canada), and let her rip for the weekend on 4.7v all day, everyday. i read the horror stories of duds everywhere and for some reason i took the risk of purchasing just a single cartomizer. needless to say i had my fingers crossed the night before. \n day 1 , i was vaping like a mad man. great flavours, and plumes of vaper that got people interested into trying my boosted ego-c. \n day 2 , going strong, same results.\n day 3 , too happy to notice anything lol.\n day 4 , sitting at my desk, redditing, researching. why? it felt like all of a sudden a wall was presented in front of me. \n throat hit and flavour was diminishing and i caught myself vaping more to find it. curiosity struck me, and i went to run some hot water through the cartomizer in my sink. blew out whatever left over water i could, and let them dry for a bit. a long while later, i tried again. refilled my tank and re-primed the filler. keep in mind though that i am currently under the weather (chest is on fire, coughs, runny nose. you know, the fun package deal). i even tried hygienic methods such as brushing my teeth, rinsing with mouth wash, waiting a bit longer in between hits. im starting to lose my happy self from being free of analogs! then i realised that i had good flavour earlier so it couldnt be me (could it?). \n im going to sleep on it. see if im just over vaping. is that even possible? i placed an order for an actual 5 pack of boges. not looking forward to how many duds i may get but still motivated to keep myself off analogs. i may get suggestions for other methods of vaping such as an atty so i also placed an order for one of those new pumpcartos that fit on top of an atty for a different way of dripping. i will also try the boiling method while i wait and maybe try some rubbing alcohol? \n anyways, thought id throw my 2 cents in. i will update this post once i get the new cartos in, and do a review on the pumpcarto as well. i will also update when i wake up and start vaping again to see what i end up with. it may not sound like i know very much, but i really did learn a lot from this subreddit and am trying to apply my new found knowledge whenever i can. for now, i work the kitchen, boiling my carto.": "electronic_cigarette",
            "I hand fed my babies today for the first time. i almost giggled when they finally trusted my foreign hand enough to go crazy for the new uncooked seafood i got them. \n i first tried the squid, it was definitely too tough for their little mouths to break off big enough pieces. hmm i guess ill keep that until they are a bit bigger. \n muscles, a bit more luck this time, they ate like half of one and then left it. vacuuming and scooping with a net ensued. \n shrimp. this. the shriiiimp, the winner out of the bag! this was the only part of the \"seafood medley\" i have found that kept their appetites through the whole meal. mind you i dont give them the whole thing as they are still very small, and after the first few bites you can see their bellies rounding out. \n right now my puffers are about 2 inches in length. i think the squid was just too rubbery. the muscles? i have no idea, not their flavour of the month i guess for right now. i have seen videos of some puffers going nuts for these two foods, and one video in particular where a gsp managed to literally vacuum up a long strip of squid no problem (although was a bit bigger than my fish). \n i have never really gotten them this kind of food before because at first i was not sure about feeding them food meant for our meals. further researched showed that many people liked to do this and apparently so did their fish. i mostly started out with flake (meh), and bloodworms. in between that and getting the seafood, i tried out ghost shrimp, mystery snails and the tiniest hermit crabs i have ever seen. tbh, no clue where the hermits are and that worrys me because i dont see remnants anywhere (they are literally that small, also the colour of my gravel probably doesnt help). the ghost shrimp were dissapointing as they are all still alive. is it just that they cant see them? theyre being like cats that just watch a mouse scurry across the floor. i catch the shrimp actually cleaning my puffers when they are low enough to the ground. wtf? lol. \n the snails are a given, they are no longer with us. i help my puffer because of the size of the snails and crack the shells. should i be helping them out, or let them figure it out? i think theyre starting to get it though, the last snail i had was not able to fully close itself in because of the damage done by puffer teeth. \n another question, i see people hand trimming their puffers teeth. would the snails or anything with a hard shell not be enough? \n Thanks": "Aquariums",
            "Today was the day that I was to take flight outside in a very open area for the first time. Straying away from my usual spot, the driveway/living room, I was already dreading what could happen from my current inability to fly well. \"Hey.. Flyaways!\" kept scrolling across the front of my mind, almost as if they were floating around my head to come back into view again as a constant reminder. No worries though, my TP-Link antenna arrived from Amazon before leaving the house, so that was immediately installed. \n I set off soon after, feeling a bit more confident with the new found range, and headed towards the empty baseball diamond. I brought 3 spare lipos with me (650mah), and the fun began. 10km/h gusts proved to be a struggle for the light quad, but still I chose to rise with the wind and gain altitude. Higher and higher I went, soaring above the stadium lights until one rogue wind took it like a sail. I quickly went into recovery mode in my mind. I stopped any controls and maintained a hover as best as I could in order to see which way was forward... Oh god. I played with it too much, a little forward pitch and she took off even further away. I felt a little sick at this point while trying to keep calm. Gone. Can't see it any longer, but recovery mode was still in action. I quickly narrowed down key land marks, a Rogers communication tower was on the other side so I packed my stuff and started walking in that general direction. I wandered through 3 or 4 blocks looking like a creep with the way I was looking around at peoples properties from the sidewalk. I then had an idea, I will attempt to arm the quad with my tx again. It was my only hope. Luckily, I didn't have to look like a complete moron as I could keep the tx in my laptop bag and still bind the quad while walking around aimlessly (but probably not from very far, I got VERY lucky here). Then, I heard it. A sound that was so welcoming that it almost brought a tear to my eye - props smacking tree branches as I applied a small amount of throttle repeatedly. To add to my returning luck, it was a leafless tree still, so it was easy to spot once it was heard! I then went up to the house on the property and knocked on the door to be presented with no answer. Hope was fading again. \"No!\" I said, and I turned to face the houses across the street and notice some folks renovating.. and I saw 2x4's. I asked one of the workers as politely as I could if they had anything that was long enough to poke something out of a tree. Of course, none of them spoke English, so I pointed at my tx, then pointed at the tree, and then let him hear the cries of one free prop and 2 others smacking into branches. He laughed and then seemed to understand. He managed to say though, \"I give you something better!\". He waved me inside the house that was under construction, and came out with a couple 2x4's. He walked them over to the tree, and screwed the two boards together and said, \"hah! Now you catch\". With him smacking branches and me feathering the throttle, it came down and I caught it with one hand. It was perfect. He then quickly detached the 2x4's, said \"good day\" and walked back to work. Then in my mind I heard, \"Theeeeere gooes my heeroooo..\" as his back turned to me (haha) and I proceeded to walk home. \n I always seem to find myself with not the best thoughts of people, but moments like today bring the light crashing back into my mind and heart. Not sure if this is just a selfish feeling, as this situation was about me, and the fact that something bad happening did not succeed. In any case, thank you kind stranger, I will not be twiddling my thumbs watching tracking information for a while now. Damn this post is longer than I wanted it to be... Sorry! \n Lesson learned people, don't let fly aways happen to you. Also, please keep in mind that the wind can be a lot different from what you are experiencing on the ground. Know the performance limits of your copters.": "Quadcopter",
            "EDIT PICS: \nSifted sand \n Not Sifted \n Checkin' out his front porch \n Front yard maintenance \n The two entrances:  , \nBack door security \n Terrible video off my blackberry, dont know if its even worth watching lol but here it is \n cross that, this recording is at least watchable: \n So... the other day i got 2 feeder crawfish for my puffers. one for my SW tank and the other light brackish, and none for the FW tank. i threw one into the SW tank and i know he wont last long in there so i stuck around to make sure he was going to die by the teeth of mr. puff instead of salt.  he was starting to get harassed so i decided it would be fine to go out for a bit. a couple hours go by and im coming through my front door returning home. put my stuff away and proceed to check out the damage done.... i was kind of creeped out lol. the crawfish was walking around slowly with its arms raised, looking closer he no longer had eyes or those feelers. was almost like a zombie. i fished him out, and gave a helping hand to my puffer and ripped it in half and threw one of them into the freezer (i know he wont finish an entire crawfish). \n i also purchased a diamond goby. i was going to get a longnose hawkfish but i think ill wait for that until i know im ready to drop $60 canadian on an awesome fish. i just love the way they post up and chill yet still looking poised and ready to go, and their colouring, so nice. so damn nice. anyways, the goby is just as cool if not cooler in my mind now. i literally went in with no knowledge of this guy and loving him before i even left. hes pure white with orange spots and some shiny bluey pattern near his face. once i saw him in action sifting my sand all i could really say was \"nooo wayy\". besides the crayfish incident, i came home to nicely turned over sand as well, and a burrow he made under a branch off of driftwood. these guys work fast! once the sand is mostly filtered, what can i feed him in the mean time so he doesnt starve? this sand bottom hasnt been established for years, its been a few months. he has been taking in some brine shrimp, thank god since the puffers seem to react to this food very slowly compared to bloodworms and large frozen shrimp from the grocery store. ive read stories about people not being able to keep these guys alive because of substrate sufficiency leading to picky eating after theres nothing left in the sand. there were other reasons as well but cant recall them off the top of my head. any advice would be appreciated, thanks guys!": "Aquariums",
            "Hello everyone, \n so i tried the mesh wick setup in my bully (which i found out was a clone) with it in a vertical position like a gensis:  .\nin this, a real bully is shown (as seen by the flat top as opposed to slanted). inside you can see that the posts are made of all metal. with mine, the clone, further down is plastic of some sort. \n when i tried the genisis way illustrated in the link, i accidentally allowed the mesh to tilt and left it that way. when test firing i found failure, but when i went to remove it this time i found the mesh actually became attached to the plastic. i had to rip it off. no residual mesh was left on but needless to say i was concerned. \n Please everyone, if you bought a bully and are not sure if its real, please look inside to see if you have the plastic at the bottom portions of the posts. they will melt from the heat and cause the mesh to become stuck. who knows if i breathed in fumes from the plastic, but making this post seemed necessary still. \n I have been aiming for 2.5-2.8ohms every build and trying to run it at 4.7-5v. it is fine now since ive stumbled upon this issue, for this style of setup. next time i am just going to roll a skinnier wick to make it easier to rebuild. this wick was a little bit on the fat side because of the amount of times i had to wrap in order to achieve my goal resistance. or i was thinking of shoving a piece of silica wick in between the mesh and post on one side then wrapping around to the other side too. thoughts? \n also, i came across a video about someone double wicking the mesh where they utilize the hole down the centre and sliding a very tiny mesh wick into it. i honestly think it works but it may just be me? you guys should try it if you have nothing else to do! and then tell me if im just dreaming or not. i guess it replaces silica rolled inside mesh. \n Heres the results:": "electronic_cigarette"
