Statistical significance testing requires subjective judgment in setting a predetermined acceptable probability (ranging between 0 and 1.0) of making an inferential error caused by the sampling error--getting samples with varying amounts of \"flukiness\"--inherent in sampling. Sampling error can only be eliminated by gathering data from the entire population.', 'If all you want is elasticity, then the simplest economic model would be a Cobb-Douglas demand function. \\n Q(good a)=c\u2022Pa^alpha \u2022Pb^beta \u2022Income^gamma \\n In this equation everything is multiplied.

Fisher introduced the t form for it fitted in with his theory of degrees of freedom.

Don\\'t get that confused with what the market price is: I might be  willing  to spend $2,000 for someone to write some computer code for me.  The fact that someone has already done it and posted it on their website for free does not make it valueless. If we simply assume that the labor theory of value says that the value of something is a function of the amount of labor it takes to create it (and even when you go deeper than that, the theory doesn\\'t get any better), let me give you a few counter examples to show you how the amount of labor that goes into something is largely irrelevant to the value. \\n 1) Suppose there is a piece of wood sitting on the ground.  If we just leave it there for 3 years, perhaps it changes color, and people think it is more beautiful, and willing to pay more for it.  Therefore, its value has increased, and no one did anything. \\n 2) Suppose this artist you refer to has this $1,000 piece you refer to.  But next week, that art either a) Gets more fashionable and is now worth $2,000, or b) Goes out of fashion, and is now worthless.

How much do you value the quality of life of a Polar Bear, and value that he shouldn\\'t have to see oil wells in ANWAR?  How much would you value NOT having a wind turbine whooshing over your house? Again, labor has nothing to do with these things, and yet we value them, and are willing to pay (or give up things) to see that nature, the air, and the environment are preserved. \\n 4) Last point: Think of all of the things that labor does that has no value, or negative value.  The student\\'s argument on a math problem: \"But I worked so HARD on it!\" Well, it is still wrong. I often spend many months on a research question, to run into a dead end.  No one values that.

All in all, this could result in thousands of regressions running. \\n 4) The problem for econometricians is that that these methods rarely produce the  correct  model (in situations where the correct model is known), the choice of what to maximize is somewhat arbitrary, doing a forwards and backwards method will often lead you to different models, none of the theory or knowledge about the problem being solved is used...\", \"No professor wants anyone to do a continuity correction like this with numbers so large, and the difference in the answer being practically zero.

The word 'spin' or angular momentum is simply a byproduct of the mathematical solution to the Schrodinger Equation, as the mathematics that describe this particular phenomena of electrons is very similar to angular momentum in classical mechanics.

However, the property is real, and it is the foundation of electromagnetic effects.\", \"I wrote an earlier post on the wave-particle duality of light but realized it didn't actually address the OP's question - that is, what exactly are electrons doing. I'll try to address that here: \\n As everyone probably knows, atoms are essentially made of two components, the nuclei and the electrons. For all chemical phenomena (excluding nuclear reactions), the nuclei stays bound with the atom. However, the electrons, like the OP has alluded to, swarms around the nuclei like a cloud. \\n There are  regions  where the electrons are likely to be found, but in quantum mechanics, you can't say for sure where the electron  is , this is a quantum mechanical effect called the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle that results in the description of the location of the electron as a  probability distribution , not a precise location. These probability distributions take the shape of spheres, dumbbells, and other shapes that become the s,p,d,f orbitals that you hear so much about in chemistry. Most importantly, the population of these orbitals using the Aufbau process is what leads to the Periodic Table of Elements. \\n Okay, that's how electrons function around atoms. But the REALLY interesting stuff is in how electrons from different atoms interact. The outermost electrons (valence electrons) are not that strongly bound to the host atom, they are easily exchanged with other atoms. This exchange process can lead to sharing of electrons (covalent bonding), direct exchange (which leads to charge imbalance and ionic bonding), or a bunch of metal atoms can be found in a  sea  of delocalized electrons that zoom about (metallic bonding). As you see, chemical bonding is completely based on how electrons interact! In this sense, electrons form the 'glue' of nature. \\n The dynamics of electron exchange also leads to a great number of interesting phenomena, such as reduction-oxidation reactions (corrosion, battery power), electron excitation (solar cells), ionization (different types of microscopes), catalysis, and much more.

However, the ways the energy  can  do work is a function of the boundary conditions. For example, let\\'s say I put a lot of energy into a balloon with fixed volume and also into a balloon with freely-movable volume. The equilibrium conditions of this balloon is different, right? One will expand (free volume) one will get hotter (fixed volume). So it seems like, in order to describe the equilibrium conditions, we require a very good way to describe free energy while taking in consideration the boundaries. \\n These different ways of describing the free energy are done as legendre transforms of the internal energy U. How to do it is below, if you don\\'t care just skip ahead. \\n ELIamaGraduateMaterialsScientist: \\nThere are intensive and extensive variables and they are conjugates of each other. Intensive variables are ones that do not scale with \\'size\\', extensive do scale with size. E.g., in PV, P is intensive, V is extensive. Other couples are TS, \\\\mu N, \\\\gamma A,  P E (polarization/electric field), MH (magnetization, magnetic field), \\\\sigma \\\\epsilon (stress strain). There are a lot of variables, and apply to a variety of situations. \\n When transforming the internal energy, we make sure that the \\'handles\\' (the things that a free to change in our system) are in the derivative (TdS has entropy in the derivative). In internal energy, all the handles are on the extensive quantities. So: \\n U = TS - PV \\n dU = TdS - PdV \\n When you transform, you add or subtract the derivatives of those terms to get to the handles of your system. For example, in Gibbs Free Energy, temperature and pressure are your handles. So: \\n G=U-TS+PV \\n dG = dU - TdS -SdT + PdV + VdP \\n  = TdS - PdV - TdS - SdT + PdV + VdP \\n\\n = -SdT + PdV\\n \\n Now that you know dG = -SdT + PdV, you can subtract the G from two different states *sharing the same boundaries (in the dV/dT term) and you get: \\n G1= -S1 dT + P1 dV \\n G2 = -S2 dT + P2 dV \\n DeltaG = (S1-S2) dT + (P2-P1)dV \\n Then if you set the T or V as a constant you\\'ll get the Gibbs Free Energy. It looks funny because there\\'s no DeltaH, but it\\'s quite trivial to prove that DeltaH = (P2-P1)dV. Exercise left to the reader? Extra Credit to whoever solves it in the comments. Start by legendre transforming the internal energy with the handles of pressure and entropy. You can also do Helmholtz free energy, which is temperature and volume as the handles, which is often more important in constrained material systems (like grain growth and whatnot). \\n \\n So now that you\\'ve transformed your internal energy to have the correct degrees of freedom corresponding to the boundaries of your system, you can now calculate how the system will  freely change  in order to reach equilibrium. \\n Gibbs Free Energy is the most prevalent one you learn because the handles are temperature and pressure, which are the easiest to control in a typical chemical environment. It is always important to use the appropriate free energy expression for your system, or else you\\'ll get nonsensical results. Like I wrote earlier, Enthalpy is similar to Gibbs Free Energy except that the handles are pressure  and entropy. That\\'s why it\\'s different than Gibbs Free Energy. Enthalpies are nice to document because they are temperature independent and so they\\'re more valuable to write down than, say, tables of Gibbs Free Energies for each system!', \"Inspired by the comments in [this thread]( \\n For the newbies, there is no true 'tank' role in Dota 2, and a team can be completely successful without any naturally high-HP hero. \\n That being said, everyone has experienced a 'tanky hero' on the opposite team.

First Nations people on the East Coast had a drink called the [\\'Black Drink\\']( while not alcoholic, it certainly was a powerful narcotic. \\nThere are many other [examples]( \\n These drinks were not distiled however, meaning that they had less bang for their buck. But that\\'s not the issue. \\n The issue is that substance abuse, in ALL forms, is directly correlated with poverty, poor living conditions, a lack of family structure, etc., etc. Basically everything that comes from being Indigenous people under Western Colonialism. The history of colonialism, with residential schools, forced education, disease, and general not-being-nice, resulted in living conditions that are ripe for substance abuse. It doesn\\'t matter what the substance is, its the symptom, not the cause. \\n Have you ever read about the  Rat Park  don\\'t get addicted to drugs. I believe it\\'s kind of the same thing. Life for post-colonial Indigenous groups has not been very happy. It\\'s not surprising that some of them seek escapism. \\n So, the', \"I hope I'm not too late to the party but I feel like there needs to be a few things cleared up here. \\n First, anthropologists already know that pre-hominid  homo  species made tools.  Homo habilis  was named the 'handy man'. [Check the wiki link]( \\n Seriously guys, this is anthro 100. After Habilis' came and went, there were still more stone tools. Check out some of the [Acheulean technology]( Those things lasted from 1.7 million to about 100,000 years ago. \\n So why is this article interesting? \\n The title is misleading (not that OP meant to, of course)- the skills the researchers are talking about are about  projectile tools . There has long been a debate about when hominid species learned to tie pointy rocks to sticks and throw them. This is some seriously, ridiculously old evidence of hominids doing just that. \\n It could be that archaic homo sapiens were making them, though that pushes the time frame back about 80,000 years, like the title says- that would be cool. Or maybe it was another Homo species-  Erectus  was kicking around back then, and Neanderthals were in Europe somewhat close to this time period, presumably stabbing things and eating them.... hell, there is even some [evidence]( suggesting that  heidelbergensis  was using spears, and those guys are like 500,000 years old. \\n Also, the dating on this was stratigraphic, not direct- [check out the actual article, its free]( and while useful, this isn't exact direct dating. The youngest layer was still 180,000 years old... and these things were found well below that. So I'm guessing they're pretty damn old. It's cool, because until now we've only had evidence of pre-humans using thrusting spears, not throwing spears. Throwing your weapon, rather then thrusting is a huge step forward in the quest to kill things easily without getting gorged by some angry, hurt wild animal. \\n Basically, the\", \"Well good Redditor, it's a great question. I think you've inspired me to write about it in an upcoming blog post. I'll post the link when I'm done, but off the top of my head: \\n People like feeling like they are part of something bigger than themselves. This feeling can be inspirational. Virantiquus had incredibly good points about social change and illumination from the past and I can speak to this from an experiential level. \\nI am currently working on a small research project as a follow up to a rather large excavation I was part of. Rather than focusing on the data from the artifacts, my partner and I are focusing on the community wide benefits that archaeology has brought. \\nWithout going in to too much detail, the responses we have got from collaborating with local First Nations have been amazing. There is a tangible connection to the past, and a feeling that some connection to a larger part of their heritage is available to them. \\n Athardude mentioned the ability for archaeology to inform modern sustainability and resource use-- this is huge where I work. Shell middens on the West Coast provided a length and depth of data on fish populations, run times, seasonality, and sustainability that otherwise wouldn't be available. \\n Archaeology has the ability to inform us about the complexities of our lives. When someone simplifies an historical narrative in an attempt to justify a current ambition or goal (either good or bad), we can provide the context to those who want to listen with a larger more complete picture, and hopefully an understanding that things are, and have always been, more complicated that they first seem. \\n And finally I offer a simpler, less tangible--but just as valid--rationale: Archaeology helps us paint a bigger, more complete picture of the world we live in. Not for any particular goal- just because its cool to understand things. I love physics and biology--not because of what they have produced FOR me, but because of the wonder and amazement they have produced IN me. We don't need to take pictures of far away galaxies-- but we should-- because it helps us understand the bigger picture. Just like physicist looking out into space, we look back in time to understand our universe. As  HaveAMap pointed out: this stuff is just plain cool. \\n I have walked my mom around one of the largest village sites in Ontario, shown her 40m wide pithouses in British Columbia, let her pick up and hold 5000 year old knives from shell middens, had her place her thumb in the preserved thumb print of a 600 year old potter.The connection she felt to other people, to the whole of humanity, made all the ours of artifact washing and data gathering worth it. I have shown young children how their ancestors made tools and fished, spoke to Elders about the stories their ancestors bones can tell, and I have learned throughout it all a little bit more about what it means to be a human in this world. I am incredibly privileged that I live in a world that supports these kind of experiences, and I see it as our responsibility to share this with as many people as we possibly can. Being human is awesome. We do ridiculously amazing stuff. We should all feel proud that we're part of something as cool as being human. And archaeology can help us feel that way. \\n I'm sorry. I got a little cheesy there at the end.\", 'Hold on there Cowboy. You\\'re all over the place. Let\\'s see what we can do here. \\n First, are we talking about City-states, Chiefdoms, or Empires? The first part of your questions seems to want to talk about Civilizations, like Mesopotamia, Egypt, Mesoamerica, etc.  But the second part seems to want to focus on when humans first started living a sedentary life-style. These are two incredibly different things. \\n Let\\'s clear up the second part first. \\nYou section about \"when we started having permanent residences\" is a giant question in archaeology. We don\\'t know everything about it, but we do know it doesn\\'t happen in \"a few generations\". \\n The movement from a nomadic lifestyle to one of permanent, multi-year long settlements is not a quick one. Frank and Bill don\\'t decide one day to stay put and start making babies with Marge and Roma.\\n In a very ( very, very, very ) generalized sense, this change happens over a couple of thousand years. In some cases, this transition may go faster (say a couple of hundred years) but in both cases the combination of environmental stability (i.e. food sources), demographics (i.e. population size), and social factors (i.e. social organization) have to come together in a certain way that either forces or allows people to stay put. \\n Just how much one of these factors is responsible for people starting to stay where they are is a source of thousands of research articles, books, dissertations, etc. We know that it takes a certain coming together of these factors- but we don\\'t know exactly how they need to come together. \\n Still with me? Good. Moving on to warfare. \\n As people start to settle down, they don\\'t need as huge an area around them to occupy. Nomadic groups, with seasonal camps, require a much large area to play in-- but as you settle down (and start living off more predictable and renewable foods), you don\\'t have to move as far. \\n If a bunch of groups do this-- and they tend to as local conditions allow-- they start forming territories. When one of these territories pump into another, then conflict starts. Warfare is one way of resolving these conflicts-- and not always the default. \\n Again- I\\'m being incredibly simplistic here-- this story plays out differently every time it\\'s reenacted-- but I\\'m giving you the abstract. \\n The thing is, these sedentary villages- they haven\\'t reached Civilization levels yet. Hell, mostly they\\'re not even at Chiefdoms by the time this starts: they have a level of social-political organization we like to call \"transegalitarian\". Because we like big words. \\n If those three factors I mentioned above (environment, demography, and social organization) interact in certain ways, we get chiefdoms. Now this isn\\'t the inevitable outcome of the march of time. It\\'s a specific response to specific factors. I mention this because it\\'s an important fact people often over look. We don\\'t move from Tribes, to Chiefdoms, to Civilizations if we have enough time. We only do it if the situations are ideal for it to happen. Civilizations are not \"more evolved\" or \"more advanced\" then nomadic hunter-gatherers. No more than a sparrow is \"more evolved\" than a mongoose. They are two different things-- the result of separate historical, geographical, and environmental factors. I mention this because when ever I taught about Early Civs, this \\'more advanced\\' nonsense came up and it bugged the crap out of me. \\n Now we can get to your first question, What happen to these people when there social structure \\'fell\\'? \\n In some cases they\\'re taken over by new leadership. The fall of Rome was probably not that noticeable to the average Roman. It happened over a long time, and was really just a switch from one kind of leader to another. Why we call it a \"Fall\" is because during this time Roman influence over the larger world lessened significantly. Which allowed other rulers to take the place of Roman Governors. Though that\\'s how it worked in Rome. \\n In the Maya area, the \"Fall\" also took a couple of hundred years, but the collapse was a movement away from centralized control, to one of more regional control. Mayan leaders didn\\'t quite disappear, they just had more local control, and less regional power. Which translate into less wealth. In the Mayan case, it was likely a combination of social factors (they were a little top-heavy towards the end) and environmental factors (it\\'s hard to be the king when your people are not growing enough food) \\n One more time ( say it with me people! )-- this is not the full answer! Simplifying the causes of a collapse into generalities means that you\\'re missing the real complexity of the situation. Like saying America went to war with Iraq for oil. You, me, and most other people know that\\'s not the  whole  truth. But it\\'s a big part of the story. \\n The best way to think about culture change is this: \\n Cultures have a variety of adaptive options, and when they form larger communities you get the multitude of different types of chiefdoms, civilizations, etc. that we see. When they are forced by a variety of factors to change again, they have the same plethora of options. Which is why studying human cultural change on a global level is so damn hard,l and why the answers--even simplified like I did here-- are so damn complicated. And fun.']": "Based on the reddit postings, the user is interested in archaeology, climate change, indigenous cultures, anthropology, human evolution, and the benefits and importance of archaeology.", "[\"So, I bet this is one the internet didn't know: \\n I had seen on here to put red wine, vinegar, and dish soap, which would make them fly in and get stuck.

Saying: \\n >Frontal lobe of humans inhibits our actions even when result can be seen as beneficial. \\n Is not true. The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is involved in impulsivity and response inhibition; however, a big job of the orbitofrontal cortex is to compare the actual outcome with the expected outcome. SO if you carry out some behavior that you are expecting to lead to a large reward, and it actually leads to a small reward or a punishment, the OFC is going to encode that information as a \"non-beneficial response\". \\n The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is the primary portal by which the cortex communicates with the basal ganglia (BG), which is the subcortical structure needed to produce and/or change motor programs (actual behaviors). The PFC --> BG projection can be potentiated by reinforcement, which is a big part of the mechanism by which the operant conditioning mentioned in OP\\'s post works. A behavior is reinforced, PFC --> Nucleus accumbens (part of the BG) synapses become potentiated, that behavior is more likely to be performed in the future. \\n Now, the OFC communicates with the PFC to make these expectation vs actual outcome comparisons, and that is how conditioning and decision making happen.', \"Other people have covered this question pretty well, but I'll touch a bit more on: \\n > Are all the cells free-moving within the tissue \\n Back in my early college days when I was starting to really explore specific interests in neuroscience, this was a huge question for me. A lot of cartoons and other illustrations in textbooks kind of make it look like neurons do just float in space, branching out and sending projections far and wide, with nothing really anchoring them down. As /u/synapticsight mentioned, glial cells have a big role in stabilizing synapses. However, a huge influence that is often overlooked is the Extracellular Matrix (ECM). \\n Some variation of ECM exists in every tissue. Probably the best example is the collagen that holds your skin cells together. In the brain, there are other fibrous proteins (proteoglycans), such as fibronectin, vitronectin, and laminin, that exist in the extracellular space, and can anchor themselves to molecules on the cell surface called Cell Adhesion Receptors. These receptors can then signal from the extracellular space to the intracellular space, particularly to actin-regulating molecules that will control cellular movement (such as the movement required for making a new dendritic spine, or new projection for an axon). \\n [Here is a little cartoon that does include ECM.]( \\n I study a family of proteins called Matrix Metalloproteinases (MMPs). As their name suggests, these are proteinases (enzymes that break down proteins), and they act in the extracellular matrix. In order for synaptic plasticity to occur, MMPs have to degrade the extracellular matrix, to allow the cell to move. Within the past 7 years or so, MMPs have been shown to be required for multiple forms of learning and memory in behaving animals, and also for an important cellular model of learning and memory that electrophysiologists use, called [Long-Term Potentiation]( \\n There is a separate class of proteins called TIMPs, which act to turn off MMPs. So, in order for learning to occur, there is a cascade that looks like this:\", 'Vyvanse is considered a pro-drug of adderall (Pro- indicates it is like a precursor). Adderall is D-Amphetamine. Vyvance is lis-D-Amphetamine, which means it is D-Amphetamine with a Lysine attached (Lysine is an amino acid). If you snort adderall, it is soluble in the mucous membrane and will get into your blood stream very quickly, and reach your brain very quickly. The Lysine attached to Vyvanse makes it less soluble through your mucous membrane. Vyvanse needs to be metabolized by the gut and liver/hepatic system, removing the Lysine, and turning it into regular old adderall. Then it can go to the brain.', \"When I started my PhD I heard terrifying statistics about how only 15-20% of people who start PhD programs ever actually land a tenure-track job in academia. Now I'm 15 months away from graduation, and I'm optimistic for my future. I don't know anyone who has graduated from my school unable to find a post-doc. The ones who did good work while they were here all landed really awesome post-docs. Two senior post-docs in my lab have gotten tenure-track faculty positions at large research universities in the past 2 years. \\n Grad school also breaks a lot of people. I would say almost 50% of people who go into grad school saying that they want to be a PI at a big research institute, have changed their mind by year 4. A lot of people can't handle the pressure of having to constantly write grants to get your own funding, or just don't want that life. So, these people find jobs either as staff scientists, or at liberal arts schools where the primary focus is teaching, and still having some money to do a little bit of interesting research.

It is beneficial to us to become aroused in response to potentially threatening stimuli in our environment. When it shifts from stress to 'anxiety' in my opinion - or at least when that anxiety becomes a disorder - is when there is a chronic stress response, often with little or no provocation. Prolonged activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA axis) causes disruptions of cortisol systems. I can't remember all of the exact specifics, but I know some. Chronically increased glucocorticoids (cortisol in humans) leads to downregulation of glucocorticuoid receptors (GRs) in the hippocampus. The hippocampus is usually involved in a negative feedback loop which shuts of the stress/cort response once it detects elevated cort. So, lack of negative feedback causes even further elevated cort. \\n Chronically elevated cort levels are associated with: \\n \\n Hippocampal dendritic atrophy. The hippocampus is required for learning and memory, so these can start to worsen.  \\n Amygdalar dendritic hypertrophy. The amydala is associated with anxiety and fear responses, but also reward responses. Typically, the behavioral phenotype seen is increased anxiety or fear. \\n Reversible prefrontal cortical dendritic atrophy. The PFC is involved in executive function, planning, working memory, decision making, etc. These abilities can be diminished in people with chronically elevated cort.\", 'It\\'s called  PubMed Central .

PSYCHIATRIC DIAGNOSIS IS BASED SOLELY ON OPINION. \\n That\\'s fine, mental disorders are based on the medical  model , not the idea that they are brain diseases. That is, it utilises the classification system and the use of symptoms as indicators, and this is the only link between mental disorders and physical diseases. \\n The shift away from thinking of mental disorders as physical diseases occurred nearly half a century ago, and with it followed the terminology shift from \"mental illness\" to \"mental disorder\". This of course doesn\\'t mean that no mental disorder is caused by a brain disease or physical \"malfunction\", or that biology plays no role in mental disorders, just that very few mental disorders are a direct result of a brain disease (e.g. syphilis). \\n The author is wrong to suggest that there are no tests for mental disorders though - there are behavioral tests. The measures here are \"subjective\" in the sense that they are measured against how people usually score in similar situations, but this is no different from a blood test where the results are gauged according to an average range. \\n >2) YES, PEOPLE CAN GET DEPRESSED, SAD, ANXIOUS AND EVEN ACT PSYCHOTIC.  THAT DOESN\u2019T MAKE THEM  MENTALLY \u201cDISEASED\u201d \\n Technically it does. A mental disorder is something which falls into the \"three D\\'s\": deviant, dysfunctional, and distressing. If a behavior is more extreme than what is usual, and significantly affects a person\\'s ability to function in their lives, and causes them to suffer, then it is a mental disorder. \\n People usually make this claim because they believe that mental disorders are just extreme forms of \"normal\" behaviors, so they shouldn\\'t be labelled as mental disorders. But psychologists reply that they are labelled mental disorders precisely because they are extreme forms of \"normal\" behaviors. We all hear voices, we all have difficulties focusing sometimes, or have moments of obsessive-compulsive thoughts and behaviors, but the reason why we don\\'t all get labelled as having schizophrenia, ADHD or OCD is because these instances are usually rare and have no real impact on our happiness or lives. Sometimes I\\'ll worry that I haven\\'t locked my front door and have to walk back up my road to check - the extent of my \"problem\" is the loss of 5 minutes. Someone who will get diagnosed with OCD will continually have to go back to check that their door is locked, to the point where the sun goes down, they\\'ve missed out on the activity they left their house to go do, and they realise they\\'ve gone hours without food and water. \\n Whether their behavior is \"normal\" in some sense, or even if it\\'s an evolutionary advantage according to some unfalsifiable evo psych theory, it makes no difference as the person still needs help. If people don\\'t want to call them \"mental disorders\" then they can pick a new name. The concept is always going to be the same: \"A thought or behavioral pattern that disrupts someone\\'s life so much that they need help\". \\n >3) THE CAMPAIGN TO \u201cSTOP THE STIGMA OF MENTAL ILLNESS\u201d IS BROUGHT TO YOU BY\u2026 BIG PHARMA \\n When you define \"Big Pharma\" as \"anyone in the mental health field\" then of course you\\'re going to find that \"Big Pharma\" is pushing the campaign because mental health issues aren\\'t that important to people not in the mental health field. \\n However, the claim is especially wrong because campaigns like \"stop the stigma\" are also heavily supported, and run by, psychologists (who have also added a lot of data and research on the topic). The reason why this makes the claim wrong is that psychologists cannot prescribe drugs, so they have no connection to Big Pharma. \\n >4) PSYCHIATRIC \u201cLABELS\u201d ARE THE PROBLEM \\n To some degree, yes, labels can add to the problems associated with mental disorder. But at the end of the day, if someone is tearing the skin off the shoulder because they believe flesh eating bugs have burrowed under their skin, giving them a label is probably the least of their worries. \\n >Increasing numbers of people  realize that just because a child fidgets, or loses pencils or toys\u2014criteria for an \u201cADHD\u201d diagnoses, this doesn\u2019t mean a child is mentally ill. \\n Classic misrepresentation of mental disorders.

People come to psychologists saying, \"I need help, here are the problems I\\'m having in my life\". Psychologists have made a note of commonalities between problems, and given reoccurring groups of problems a category label. This is because it makes it easier to say a person is suffering from \"Disorder X\", rather than saying they are suffering from, \"Symptoms A, B, D, G, H, X, and Y\". \\n They don\\'t need to \"add\" the term \\'disorder\\' to the end of it because it\\'s already implied by the fact that the people have come in asking for help.

The mental health field recognises a number of effective non-drug treatments for a range of mental disorders; for example, the main treatments for depression, anxiety, autism and phobias are primarily are non-drug therapies (although some drugs can be used in combination for more effective results). \\n If Big Pharma were behind the DSM, and people were tricked into believing they had mental disorders in order to promote and sell drugs, then why is such a lucrative field like autism relatively untouched? Why would they hand over such an easy market (given that Big Pharma apparently doesn\\'t need to make drugs that actually work) to behavioral therapists? And why would behavioral therapists bother spending 40+hours a week with kids doing extensive training, if they could just work with Big Pharma to sell off snake oil? \\n >The larger problem is that the biological drug model (based on the bogus mental disorders are a disease marketing campaign) prevents governments from funding real medical solutions for people experiencing difficulty. \\n This quote contained a link, but I couldn\\'t bring myself to insert it here. The author is strongly against Big Pharma. Against evil corporations attempting to steal your money by lying to you and promoting treatments that don\\'t really work. So their alternative is to link you to a number of alt med sites, that sell things like homeopathic pills to cure your autism. But this is okay of course because, as we know, the alt med industry is just the little guy, it hardly makes any money. That\\'s why they can\\'t perform any research to demonstrate the effectiveness of their products, and Big Medicine is keeping them down by not testing their products for them. Except for when they do, but of course then they fake negative results to suppress real treatments, because a money hungry evil corporation like Big Pharma would hate to find an effective treatment or cure for multiple diseases and disorders, that costs nearly nothing to make and has a huge profit margin... \\n There are problems and side-effects associated with medication. Sometimes, for some people, medication brings about more problems than it solves and here we need to look for non-drug alternatives for them. But we don\\'t need to turn to bullshit like reiki, or homeopathy, or whatever. We can turn to things like cognitive behavioral therapy, or systematic desensitisation, or applied behavioral therapy.

Even if the difference was .0001%, an adequately designed experiment would be able to confidently conclude that it\\'s a true effect. Given that the results were statistically significant, it can safely be assumed that it falls outside a margin of error. \\n >As a side note, I didn\\'t see anything written about how many kids in the study were boys and how many were girls, but I was making the assumption that it was 50/50.

Wilkinson and Peter W.R. Woodruff, \"Male and female voices activate distinct regions in the male brain\", In Press, NeuroImage. I\\'m deeply puzzled by some of the research that paper describes -- if Sokhi et al. really did what they seem to be saying they did, I don\\'t see how the results can be interpreted at all -- but I\\'m pretty sure that the experiment doesn\\'t mean most of the things that people are saying it does. Maybe it doesn\\'t mean any of them. \\n >... \\n >Thus when they say (in their press release) that \"when a man hears a female voice\" such-and-such a region of his brain is activated, what they mean is that the specified region is (among the regions where) the two conditions specified in (i) are met: first, \\'female gender-apparent\\' recordings create significantly more activation than  \\'male gender-apparent\\' recordings, and second, \\'female gender-ambiguous\\' recordings yield significantly greater activation than  \\'male gender-ambiguous\\' recordings. \\n >But there are some other descriptions you could give of that set of conditions. For example, you could say that these are the brain regions that respond more to higher-pitched speech than to lower-pitched speech; and for speech in a medium pitch range, respond more to recordings that have been slowed down to reach that level than to recordings that have been speeded up to reach that level. Or perhaps, respond more to phrases that are longer in duration than to phrases that are shorter in duration. This last is not a trivial issue, especially since the subjects were listening to the stimuli against the background of scanner noise, which is roughly like being in a boiler factory inside one of the boilers. (It\\'s possible to arrange the scanning acquisition so that audio stimuli are played in silent intervals, but that was not done in this experiment). So higher-pitch or longer-duration stimuli will probably be more acoustically salient, especially in this very noisy environment, and therefore might show increased auditory activation, quite apart from any sexuality judgments. And lower-pitch or shorter-duration stimuli will be harder to hear, and therefore might engage some additional attention-focusing mechansisms, again apart from any sexuality judgments. \\n >... \\n >So as I said, I\\'m really puzzled about how to think about what these results mean. Whatever is going on, though, there\\'s nothing in their results to stand behind statements like \"[t]he female voice is actually more complex than the male voice, due to differences in the size and shape of the vocal cords and larynx between women and men\", as the Sheffield press release asserts. \\n >And the same press release says that \"when a man hears a female voice the auditory section of his brain is activated, which analyses the different sounds in order to \\'read\\' the voice and determine the auditory face\" -- are we supposed to conclude that males hears male voices in a way that by-passes the auditory cortex? Well, they go on to say that \"[w]hen men hear a male voice the part of the brain that processes the information is towards the back of the brain and is colloquially known as the \\'mind\\'s eye\\'. This is the part of the brain where people compare their experiences to themselves, so the man is comparing his own voice to the new voice to determine gender.\" \\n And here: [GENDER MYTHS: LETTING SCIENCE MISLEAD](', 'You could try training \"creativity\" or novel behaviors, as demonstrated by Pryor  here . \\n It\\'s possible that he may have experienced a kind of  learned helplessness , meaning that there is no incentive for him to want to try to do different things. The best way to overcome learned helplessness is to teach him skills that show him that other behaviors are possible in given situations, and that they can be fun and pleasurable for him. \\n This approach is basically just what I\\'ve described above by teaching him to bark at the TV. For my dog, I like to get him excited when someone knocks at the dog or rings the doorbell, so I get someone to knock at the door and I jump up and say something like, \"Who\\'s that?!\", then run to the front door, getting him to chase/follow me. I then lavish him with praise, cuddles, treats etc. I now have an incredibly placid dog that almost never makes a noise, except for when the doorbell goes and he runs down there and barks his head off. I then let people in and he sits quietly to be patted and then trots off. \\n Just be patient, and be realistic in what the end result will be - i.e. don\\'t expect to end up with a wacky dog that acts spontaneously all the time. Enjoy small successes and treat them as if your dog has just won gold in an Olympic event.', 'I\\'m not sure what the \"challenge\" is supposed to be, as both defending or failing to defend either of those positions has absolutely no bearing on whether religious thinking is reasonable or correct. \\n 1)  Think of a question which has/had a scientific answer, where a religious one was better:  Why would we expect religion to have answers about the natural world? Some specific religions, and religious people, have attempted to speculate on such questions, but religion as a whole and science answer distinctly different questions. The entire basis of the question rests on the myth of the science-religion conflict. \\n We could equally do the same thing to science, and propose: \"Think of a question which has/had a mathematical answer, where a scientific one was better\". It makes no sense to judge the validity and worth of a field by comparing it to the standards of a completely different area. Most religions aim to discuss and provide answers to the \"meaning\" and \"purpose\" of life, to explain how you should live your life to get through the pearly gates or hump your 72 virgins. Science obviously has nothing to say on such matters, so religion could still (theoretically) be relevant, useful and important, even if it can\\'t propose a better model for quantum mechanics. \\n The author makes the challenge even more ridiculous by explicitly ruling out any knowledge through forms like revelation or divine dictation, which probably boils down to the idea that he wants a form of knowledge accepted by science - making the whole challenge a little circular. It also assumes that science is a valid method for uncovering truth, which requires a number of assumptions and supporting arguments but isn\\'t too unreasonable, however, the problem is that not everybody needs to assume such a thing. \\n That is, if a religious person accepts that science is the best method for uncovering the natural world, and accepts that science is founded upon methodological naturalism, then there is absolutely no conflict between the idea (for example) that human bodies cannot come back from the dead, and accepting that Jesus was resurrected. This is just because science has no tool or way of investigating miracles or supernatural events. \\n So, like Galileo, a religious person can accept that scientific knowledge is the best way to \"discover\" god, as the natural world is presumably his work (hung up on his mother\\'s fridge somewhere). \\n 2)  Name one moral or ethical action or behavior committed or carried out by a believer that could not have been committed or carried out by an atheist:  This is a valid rebuttal of the claim that religions have exclusive rights over morality, but it does nothing to answer the question of whether religious ideas should have a \"foothold\" in the realm of morality. If an ethicist could demonstrate that religious views of morality were more consistent, produced better outcomes, or performed the best on some metric, then that would give credence to the idea that religious morality is valuable. Whether anyone could  actually do that  is the problem for religious ideas, not the claim that religion has a monopoly on morality. \\n Interestingly, with the morality issue, we can demonstrate why the first question is misleading and dishonest. If we change the first question to:  \"Think of a question where a religious one was better than a scientific one\" , and eliminate the requirement that religion needs to be better than science at science, we find that morality is one area where it is better able to provide an answer. That is, on the question of whether we should or should not kill someone, science has absolutely no say on the matter but religion can make some arguments against it. \\n This isn\\'t to say that \"science has failed\", because \\'ought\\' claims aren\\'t a part of the naturalistic questions it is limited to answering, and it doesn\\'t even mean that the religious arguments supporting one course of action are \"correct\", just that it has the foundation capable of developing reasons against things like murder.', 'It\\'s not that they use different methods, it\\'s that one relies on evidence and verification and the other doesn\\'t. That\\'s the conflict. \\n Not quite, they both rely on evidence and verification but since they deal with different subject matter, they use different kinds and standards of evidence. \\n >It doesn\\'t matter if they\\'re concerned with the same questions or not. That  would  matter if you were talking about whether religion conflicts with scientific facts (such as evolution), but that\\'s not what I mean when I say there\\'s a conflict between science and religion. Science is bigger than just the accumulation of scientific facts; \"science\" is the process, the method of inquiry. \\n It does matter because otherwise the claim would be that science conflicts with everything, since everything non-science uses different types of evidence and levels of verification. \\n >I\\'ll try to explain what I see is the key difference between science and religion: \\n >Suppose you\\'ve got a group of scientists trying to come up with an explanation for why some phenomena occurs, and suppose you\\'ve also got a group of theologians trying to answer some theological question. \\n >Now further suppose that several of the scientists come up with competing hypotheses, and several of the theologians likewise come up with contradictory, mutually exclusive answers \\n >How each group proceeds from that point is the fundamental difference between science and religion. \\n >Science takes the competing hypotheses, puts them to the test, and allows us to discover which ones were wrong. Religion can\\'t do that. The theologians simply have to agree to disagree. \\n >']": "Based on the reddit postings, it appears that the user is primarily interested in the field of mental health and psychology.

I assume the thermos is a lost cause - sitting for 3 years filled with coffee likely ruined it forever, so I get ready to toss it in the garbage. \\n But wait, another officemate says as he opens the thermos, the coffee inside isn\\'t even moldy. We begin to look nervously at each other, because we all know what\\'s about to happen. Finally, one of them blurts out, \"I\\'ll drink it for a dollar.\" As if out of thin air, a dollar is immediately produced, and the bet has commenced. \\n We watch as he slowly raises the thermos to his lips, unsure whether to laugh or cry. Several swallows later, he sets the thermos down, only to declare its flavor profile as \"kind of grainy, but not too bad\".', 'You\\'ve actually asked two separate questions here, and the answers are probably mutually exclusive: \\n 1) Where on Earth has the least light pollution? \\n 2) Where on Earth could one see the most stars with the naked eye? \\n For the first question, \"the middle of the Pacific\" is as good an answer as any. There are many locations in the ocean where all light domes from civilization are located well below the horizon, due to the Earth\\'s curvature. \\n However , your second question is actually much more complex - observing stars from these oceanic locations has two difficulties. First, you\\'re at sea level, which means extra atmosphere above you to scatter starlight. Second, there tends to be a lot of water vapor in the atmosphere over the ocean. That causes further scattering, reducing the transparency of the skies quite a bit. \\n So, to observe more stars, you want to be at elevation in order to be above a substantial fraction of the atmosphere...but not too high. Above about 10,000 feet, you start to become oxygen-deprived, and your eyes can no longer dilate as large as they can below that elevation, thus reducing the number of stars that are visible. \\n I\\'ve experienced this first-hand while observing on Mauna Kea - you can see more stars at base camp around 9,000 feet than you can at the top of the mountain near all the telescopes, almost 14,000 feet. It\\'s as though your eyes just can\\'t quite get dark-adapted - though you can suddenly see many more stars if you use an external oxygen tank (but that\\'s basically cheating for the purpose of this question). \\n To reduce atmospheric water vapor, you really want to be in a desert region. Atmospheric transparency, often measured in terms of the distance to the visible objects on the horizon, can be greater than 100 miles in the desert (as opposed to a limit of about 10 miles in much more humid locations). This is a large reason why astronomers tend to build big telescopes in deserts - it\\'s not just a greater number of clear nights. \\n So to see the most stars, we\\'re looking for regions that are very far from civilization (to reduce light pollution), in the desert, and near 10,000 feet elevation. I\\'m going to go out on a limb here, and say that the Tibesti mountain range in northern Chad (in the middle of the Sahara desert) is probably your best bet - it has a couple peaks higher than 10,000 feet. The Atacama desert in Chile is also a good candidate here, but there are cities not too far away.', \"Very good question - nitrogen is an interesting case. You list the main volcanic gases, but volcanoes do emit some nitrogen, often as [nitric oxides]( not a whole lot. \\n However, molecular nitrogen, N2, is a unique constituent. It has a greater [bond-dissociation energy]( than almost any other molecule. This means only the most extreme ultraviolet photons have enough energy to break apart molecular nitrogen into two nitrogen atoms, and photons that energetic are relatively rare. \\n This is important because a molecule of nitrogen gas, N2, is twice as heavy as an atom of nitrogen. It's much easier for lighter atmospheric constituents to escape into space than heavier constituents. So, nitrogen's escape rates are much lower than other gases since it generally stays in its molecular state. \\n The strong N2 bond also means it's very difficult for nitrogen atoms to get absorbed into other compounds, so there's not a lot of atmosphere-surface chemistry the way there is with, say, molecular oxygen. I'm not a biologist, so you might know more about this, but I believe a lot of biology involves creative ways to fix nitrogen. \\n So, between decreased escape rates, and low chemical interaction rates, nitrogen needs significantly less replenishment to maintain constant levels. If volcanoes on Earth did turn off, we'd still eventually lose our nitrogen, but at a significantly slower rate than other gases.\", 'First we need to understand the current structure of Jupiter. \\n At the top we have the atmosphere, made mostly of cold hydrogen gas. As we dive deeper, the pressure and temperature starts rising. Eventually once hot and dense enough we hit a layer where hydrogen has transitioned to a \"supercritical fluid\", a state that shares properties with both solids and gases. Going even deeper, the pressures increase further so that hydrogen is forced into a solid state, in spite of warm temperatures. \\n Somewhere around ~30% of the way down, the pressure is so great the electrons from hydrogen atoms are forced into higher and higher energy states so as not to violate the Pauli Exclusion Principle. Electrons can start moving freely, conducting between atoms, and so the hydrogen becomes metallic. At the temperatures we expect at these depths, it is in a liquid metallic state. \\n Finally, deep, deep down, there is some kind of solid core of rock and ice, although exactly how large it is remains a subject of vigorous debate. Hopefully we\\'ll know more about this puzzle when the Juno spacecraft arrives at Jupiter in 2016 and starts probing the deep interior. \\n Now, as for the cooling bit: it turns out to be quite difficult for metallic hydrogen to cool, as electrons must drop down to lower energy states...but it\\'s at such high pressure that most of those states are all already occupied. It can still happen by conducting/diffusing heat into non-metallic layers, but that\\'s an incredible slow process, very similar to white dwarf stars cooling into \"black dwarfs\" after considerable time. \\n Over many billions of years, the liquid metallic interior, will likely cool enough to become a solid metallic interior. This isn\\'t quite certain, as the phase diagram for hydrogen at such extreme pressures is not well known - it may be that metallic hydrogen can remain a liquid even at low temperatures for a specific range of high pressures. \\n Once most of this heat has escaped to space, the overlying gaseous atmosphere will eventually collapse, becoming a solid ice. This process may be somewhat similar to how part of Mars\\' CO2 atmosphere collapses into CO2 ice caps during each winter.', \"Wow, this was the exact same question I was asked on my graduate school orals. What follows is a bit technical, but this is really just a function of the planet's gravity and temperature, as well as the escape velocity of molecular hydrogen gas, the prime constituent of any proto-stellar nebula. \\n Hydrogen molecules have much less mass than, say, oxygen molecules...which in turn means that at a given temperature, hydrogen molecules are moving that much faster. We can get at some values for this by looking at the Maxwell-Boltzmann velocity distribution, where the most probable velocity is v = sqrt(2kT/m) and the standard deviation of velocity is v = sqrt(3kT/m). \\n For example, on Earth with a temperature of ~300K, the average velocity of an hydrogen molecule will be: \\n v avg  = sqrt( ^2kT /  m  ) = sqrt ( ^2 (1.38e-23 ^J/K) (300 ^K) /  (3.35e-27 kg)  ) = 1572 m/s \\n That's still a long way from Earth's escape velocity, but remember that this is just the most probable velocity for a hydrogen molecule...there's a whole distribution of molecules moving at different velocities. The standard deviation of that velocity distribution will be: \\n v stddev  = sqrt( ^3 /  2  )   v avg * = 1925 m/s \\n So, when you consider that Earth's escape velocity is 11,200 m/s, that means any molecules that are moving 5 standard deviations over the the most probable speed will escape the planet for good. Admittedly, that's not many escaping at any given time...only about 1 in 650 billion are moving fast enough at any one instant (assuming it's a gaussian distribution, which it's not exactly). However, as those fastest molecules leave, the velocity distribution sorts itself out again, promoting new hydrogen molecules to those speeds, which then leave the planet, etc. Eventually the entire mass of molecular hydrogen will evaporate off the planet as the fastest few molecules are repeatedly culled from the distribution. \\n It's much more difficult for something like oxygen do this. With a molecular mass 16 times greater, it's average velocity and standard deviation will be 4 times less: v avg  = 393 m/s, and v stddev  = 481 m/s \\n That works out such that oxygen molecules with velocities only about 22.5 standard deviations above the most probable value have escape velocity. I'm actually having trouble finding any calculator that can figure out how few molecules this is, since it's so incredibly few (if you can find one that can do erf() functions on large numbers, let me know). The point is here that the number of oxygen molecules leaving is few enough that it's easily replenished by the combined action of volcanism and photosynthesis. \\n Now, let's consider hydrogen gas on Jupiter. Since Jupiter is only about half the absolute temperature of Earth, hydrogen molecules are are only moving about 70% as fast as they are here on Earth. More importantly, though, Jupiter's escape velocity is almost 6 times higher than Earth's. This works out such that hydrogen molecules on Jupiter must be moving 42 standard deviations about the most probable value to escape...again, not significant over the lifetime of the planet, and so Jupiter holds on to its hydrogen.\", \"So what the sketchy science websites ignore is the feedback loop between temperature and CO2 concentration. Yes, it's true that in most warming periods (but not all) CO2 lags temperature by several hundred years - but all that tells you is that CO2 did not start that specific warming event. Increasing CO2 concentration causes rising temperatures, but rising temperatures also cause increasing CO2 concentration. \\n From what we understand about climate, this actually makes sense. Rising temperatures increase the weathering rate of rocks, which releases more CO2 into the atmosphere. In turn, the increased CO2 concentration raises the temperature further via the greenhouse effect. Thus, there is a positive feedback loop until a new equilibrium temperature is reached. \\n For the eras that we have the time resolution to distinguish CO2 concentration versus temperature, most of the warming events were started by orbital variations known as [Milankovitch cycles]( resulting in greater amounts sunlight being absorbed by Earth. Since this is an external cause for the warming, one would not expect the CO2 concentration to play a role in the warming event until increased weathering had kicked in - thus the centuries of lag. \\n One of the (many) fallacies that said sketchy websites make is that of [Single Cause]( - namely that because CO2 wasn't the initial driver of most prior warming events, it can't be for current or future warming events. In fact, there's fairly good evidence that the [Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum]( was caused by a sudden release of greenhouse gas in the Arctic Ocean when several millions of tons of methane clathrates melted. Temperatures very quickly rose after that.\"]": "Based on the summary of the reddit postings, the user appears to be interested in the following areas:\n1.

If you\\'re familiar with the dot product, you know that any orthogonal vectors have a vanishing dot product. More generally, we can define [inner products]( on spaces, and then  define  orthogonality to mean that the inner product vanishes. \\n This definition of orthogonality is neat because it allows you to express vectors in orthogonal bases with ease: each component is just the inner product of the vector with the unit vector corresponding to that component. For example, with the dot product, you can find the  x -coordinate of any vector by dotting it with (1,0,0), which is the unit vector corresponding to the  x -component. \\n Let\\'s formalize. In general, if  e^i  is the  i th unit vector, and  v  is some vector in the space, then  i th component of  v  is given by \\n v^i  = ( e^i ,  v ) \\n where ( a , b ) is the inner product of  a  and  b . This only works if all of the  e^i  are mutually orthogonal; we can talk about why if you like. \\n This more abstract statement is applicable to much more than just the dot product. For instance, you might be familiar with Fourier series, where you can break up any function into a sum of sines and cosines. This seems like a crazy idea at first, but what makes it all tick is an inner product on the space of functions, together with the fact that the sines and cosines form a basis in that space. Under this inner product, all of the sines and cosines are mutually orthogonal, so to find the coefficient for each term in the series, all you have to do is to take the inner product of your \"vector\" (function) with each of the sine and cosine functions. That\\'s what a Fourier series / transform actually  is \u2014rewriting a function in the basis of sines and cosines using the inner product to find the components.', 'Hi there! It looks like you\\'re interested and excited, which is always great. Let me give you a brief picture of what astronomy looks like as a career. \\n \\n To be an astronomer, you would generally be working for a university or a government lab. The kind of work you might actually do could range from designing new telescopes to find exoplanets to creating theoretical models of large-scale structure in the universe. Whatever the specific focus, you would be performing original research and doing a lot of creative thinking. \\n That said, it\\'s worth knowing this early: the big measure of success is the quality and quantity of the work you can publish, but that isn\\'t all there is to it. Depending on your exact position, you may also spend a great deal of time writing proposals for grant money, and your job security may depend strongly on how much money you can bring in to your institution. If you want to become a professor, which is one of the most comfortable positions in the field, you can also expect to spend time teaching and mentoring graduate students. This means you\\'d be spending less of your time on research, and more of your time directing a small army of students and postdocs to do it for you. \\n It\\'s also worth knowing early that the job market for astronomy research positions is extremely tough. This means it\\'s good to keep track of what skills you have that are marketable elsewhere, and fortunately, most astronomers pick them up along the way. For instance, many astronomers become very skilled with data analysis and interpretation, and then they become \"data scientists\" at big tech companies or on Wall Street. \\n \\n Now let me outline what steps one typically takes to become a professional astronomer. \\n It starts with an undergraduate degree, which is typically (but not necessarily) in physics or astronomy. You need a significant physics background to begin a graduate education in astronomy. \\n Next, you\\'ll need a PhD in physics or astronomy. There\\'s very little you can do, professionally speaking, with anything less. A master\\'s degree can help you find work in industry outside astronomy research, but it\\'s not very useful in the research world. \\n Once you have a PhD, you can apply directly for research positions, or for tenure-track professorships. However, most people need to get some more research experience first, so it\\'s very common to take some time for one or more postdoctoral fellowships. After that, with any luck, you\\'ll be well-connected enough to make a bid for a long-term position. \\n You mentioned a concern about exams. The only exam that could really be said to weed people is the GRE exam that most schools rely on in the graduate admissions process. The exam should be pretty straightforward by the time you finish the undergraduate curriculum. Graduate programs also have qualifying exams: these are big comprehensive tests that come after your first year or two, and passing lets you continue in the program. But these usually aren\\'t meant to weed people out; most schools will let you retake the exam if you fail. \\n I hope that all this leaves you with a sense of how much of a commitment it can take to have a career in astronomy. I don\\'t want to scare you off by any means\u2014if this is what you want to do, and you understand what the field looks like, this might be for you.', \"You've gotten some answers here, but the way that many physicists think about it is as a consequence of geometry. I'll try to explain. \\n One way to characterize a space is by its symmetries. For example, a Euclidean (normal) space is symmetric under rotation and translation. In particular, the length of a vector doesn't change if you rotate or translate your point of view. \\n Now, try to imagine space and time together in one four-dimensional  Euclidean  space. That is, say you just have a plain old  x  axis,  y  axis,  z  axis, and  t  axis. In this space, there's one more symmetry: if you keep uniformly translating your viewpoint as a function of the  t  coordinate, the lengths of vectors in space still remain the same. To give that a physical interpretation: space looks the same to you no matter what speed you move with. \\n But in special relativity, our four-dimensional spacetime  isn't  Euclidean. And while it still has rotational and translational symmetry, it doesn't have the same symmetry under a change of speed\u2014it has a different one. If you change your speed in special relativity,  space  doesn't look the same; instead, there's a combination of space and time that does look the same. In particular, the quantity \\n \u2206 s ^2 = \u2206 t ^2 - \u2206 x ^2 \\n is the same for any observer, where \u2206 x  and \u2206 t  are the distance and time between two events. To be clear, if spacetime were Euclidean, \u2206 x  and \u2206 t  would independently be preserved. \\n What we learn from this is that spacetime doesn't behave in a Euclidean way. Moreover, our formula for \u2206 s  is analogous to the distance between points in spacetime: it's something that's always the same for every observer. So let's take a shift in our perspective, and say: \\n Spacetime is a four-dimensional space where distances are given by \u2206s instead of by the Euclidean distance formula. \\n But to a mathematician, it's easy to say exactly what this space is: it's [Minkowski space]( And thus, the entire content of special relativity can be summed up like this: \\n Spacetime is Minkowskian rather than Euclidean. \\n That's a much more elegant way to look at it, and it gives you everything you expect from special relativity: the privileged status of one speed, time dilation, length contraction, the works. \\n This is an extremely long answer to your question, so let me tie it back to what you were asking.\", 'This is a surprisingly popular question these last couple weeks. You may find [this thread]( and [this thread]( interesting. I\\'ll quote my answer from the second one: \\n > This has been recently discussed  here . But we still aren\\'t sure what space is \"made of\".\\n>\\nTo be sure, there are some models. Simplistically, general relativity says that space and time together form one higher-dimensional surface (a [manifold]( that exists independently of what\\'s on it. But general relativity doesn\\'t mesh very well with quantum mechanics at the highest energies and the smallest scales, and many physicists think that there\\'s a quantum picture of what space is that we don\\'t have yet. One example of an idea in this realm is that of [quantum foam](\\n>\\nWe probably won\\'t be able to thoroughly test any ideas about the quantum nature of spacetime for a long while because the energies we would need to reach for experiments are absurdly high. This is one of the biggest open problems in physics, and you can read more about it by looking for stuff on [quantum gravity]( While this is a broader topic, a theory of quantum gravity might one day give us insight into the nature of what spacetime actually is.', \"Yeah, maybe I was simplifying too much. The rigorous statement is that the reals are [isomorphic]( (via a [ring homomorphism]( to any [complete]( [Archimedean]( [ordered field]( \\n You can definitely define a [total order]( on the points of the plane, like the one you describe. The difficulty lies in defining an ordering that's compatible with the operations of a [field]( \\n It should be noted that the plane isn't a field (in the above sense) all by itself\u2014fields have a notion of multiplication, and there are many different possible definitions of multiplication you could use to give the plane a field structure.

We conventionally write  i  = (0,1) and 1 = (1,0). \\n In other words, this field has  i ^2 = -1. Sound familiar? This is just the complex plane! But there is no way to order the elements of the complex plane in a way that respects the field structure. \\n You might think that there should exist  some  field structure on the plane that can be ordered. And formally, you can indeed find these!

Second, and more importantly, there are many different and effective strategies for overcoming this kind of existential angst and ennui.  Meaning is a fascinating and funny thing, and I\\'ve actually been conducting scientific research on modern sources of existential meaning for several years now.  I struggled deeply with these issues myself a while back, to the point where it was debilitating - life has no meaning, everyone is walking around in painful ignorance of this fact, the world is falling to pieces, and nothing we do will ever matter.  Sound familiar?  Thing is, if you start reading some of the classics, you\\'ll quickly find that existential concerns have driven much of human creativity and thought since time immemorial - you\\'re in great company, and I personally found a lot of comfort just in that discovery alone.  One of my favorite examples of this was reading Meditations by Marcus Aurelius.  A Roman emperor, living thousands of years ago, struggling with the exact same questions and insecurities I\\'m grappling with today - who knew?  In fact, as some of the other responses in this thread have suggested, the most jarring realization that I had during this time was that most people - on varying levels of consciousness - are dealing with these issues too.  People put up a lot of barriers, because the world\\'s a scary place and we\\'re all trying to pretend like we have it all figured out to save face - but if you randomly pick someone of the street, get to know them a bit, and have an authentic conversation with them about these things, most people will open right up and reveal the same underlying concerns.  We\\'re all in the same boat, we\\'re all human and we know it.

Meaning can be created in many different ways - by picking up a book and engaging with new ideas, by picking up a paintbrush and actualizing your own creative visions (self-actualization), or by putting the paintbrush or book down in favor of going outside to spend time with your friends, family, or even just by yourself, enjoying the company of the world\\'s natural beauty (self-transcendence.)

Old books are straight to the point, new books give tons of \"examples\" of things and a hell of a lot more problems at the end of the chapters. Another key difference is the principles of the forces behind chemistry. So many new things have been found out since then and will (should) be in a newer edition.

Every movement of a particle, or, if you prefer the soul, every thought, every emotion and every sense, is a change. These changes separate you from your past and your future. Plus, you cannot know, for certain, that your memories are correct (of course, the only things you can prove are things you define yourself, if you're a fallibilist like me). You cannot prove that you were conscious before  this  instant, and you cannot know that you'll still be after it. But, what is in instant? There may be no such thing, if time is continuous, which is something we usually assume in math. \\n From this I extend that you're continuously dying (in terms of consciousness) and  you  don't exist, because  you  can have no perfectly accurate definition (even with non-local hidden variable theories in QM), even if it isn't known to you. You can only define yourself within an interval of time, which could  always  be reduced. \\n However, looking at our brains, our experience probably is discrete, but not in regular intervals. But, this means you acknowledge the existence of physical objects (as opposed to being  the  solipsist), and the brain (as opposed to the mind or soul) is probably continuously changing.\", 'Testing the hypothesis that the brain is the seat of consciousness would be science, but nobody has yet designed an experiment that shows anything more than correlation. Correlation does not imply causation. \\n What about magnetic stimulation and psychoactive drugs, in general? Anesthesia\\'s a pretty good bridge between the brain and consciousness. Are you saying that these are just correlations? It just so happens every time I give X person Y drug, Z happens, even after comparing with placebo?

Essentially, you are saying that if you like an idea, or scientists you agree with assume it, then it is science, and if you don\\'t then it must lie outside science. \\n I\\'m not defining science by belief, but anything beyond the possibility of empirical evidence is beyond science (of course, we can\\'t always know or agree upon whether something is beyond this possibility or not, as in the case of string theory). Physicalism sticks with that evidence (and, of course, doesn\\'t question the possibility of \\'true\\' evidence) and does not venture beyond it. It\\'s just like how Copenhagen was (maybe not so much anymore) the most popular, and justifiably so, of the interpretations of Quantum Mechanics, because Bohr was a logical positivist and outright rejected what he could not observe/measure. There was also the intrumentalist \"shut up and calculate\", which is a true lack of interpretation. I\\'m agnostic about the existence of God, but I\\'m also an atheist, because I can\\'t support His existence (with science). So science may be more like agnosticism and instrumentalism, in the sense that it avoids interpretation, but if an interpretation is useful (like Copenhagen was), then one which does not assume more than science and rejects all else is preferable. Some things like our supposed subjectivity and realism are nice and intuitive, but these are perceptions that science does not have much to say about (although Bell\\'s theorem shows that the counterfactual definiteness type of realism is incompatible with locality) and that we should thus question. Since science doesn\\'t point to realism, I don\\'t believe in it. I like it; I used to  prefer  the counterfactually definite but nonlocal de Broglie-Bohm interpretation of Quantum Mechanics, but there are experiments that may be disproving it (or making it more and more contrived to get around the results of these experiments).

Now, there are ways to \"sense\" this, using concrete examples for the abstractions: you hold one apple in each hand and then put them in the same hand, and, now, you\\'ve got two apples in one hand. So, there are ways to imagine or \"sense\" relations (most of them, I would think, but not higher spatial dimensions, for example) in mathematics, but they don\\'t need to be \"sensed\" to be true, like with subatomic particles, as darth_choate mentioned.

I\\'m a nihilist in many of its forms, but logic and nihilism, itself, are the only exceptions to my epistemological nihilism. In the end, most of what I consider true (physical reality), I consider true pragmatically.  Ideally , there is only logic. \\n Let\\'s assume we\\'re living in a computer simulation, so that our physical reality is programmed. Now, the \"programmers\" would have their own physical reality, which likely wouldn\\'t be the same as our own (unless they\\'re attempting an exact copy). The symbols for their mathematics would be different (in fact, they may not even use symbols, because they may not even \"see\", but I doubt that), although the concepts behind them would still hold. Evidently, the theory that  we\\'re  in a simulation is not falsifiable, but it\\'s very easy to imagine  us  creating our own simulation. So, now, we get to choose physical reality, and, if, eventually, intelligent \"life\" were to evolve in our simulation, to them, it\\'s still true that 1+1=2, regardless of the representation. Obviously, to us, their mathematics would be describable in terms of computer science, mathematics and our physics, so we would see a physical manifestation, but  they  wouldn\\'t have access to our computers and our physical reality. They\\'d have access to their \"brains\" and \"neural connections\", but the point is that the representation on the two levels of existence could be fundamentally different, such that, although your \"1\", my \"1\" and my computer\\'s \"1\" are similar in that they use the same types of matter, forces, etc., our \"1\"s and their \"1\"s may be very different (they don\\'t necessarily have cells or even electrons, for example). The terms \"neural network\" and \"brain\" could therefore be used abstractly, because theirs would be analogs to ours. I also don\\'t agree with what woodhuck64 said (\"Abstractions, including numbers and logic, only exist as neural connections.\" Evidently, our computers (usually?) don\\'t use neural networks, but they still perform mathematical computation, whether or not they have qualia, \"the subjective quality of conscious experience\", to quote Wikipedia.) The term \"computer\" is already used pretty abstractly; there are mechanical \"computers\", like the Antikythera mechanism, and biological ones: our brains and DNA (even though they use the same matter and forces, so they\\'re different combinations of the same fundamental physical properties and laws). \\nEventually, the definition of \"existence\" also comes into question. If we created them, does their physical reality \"exist\"? We can watch them perform experiments to study their matter, but we cannot do the same with their matter, because we don\\'t have access to it in the same way they do.

We also know the electron in the Hydrogen atom only absorbs and emits certain discrete amounts of energy in the form of photons of certain discrete wavelengths or frequencies. \\n [From Wikipedia]( \\n \"In physics, a quantum (plural: quanta) is the minimum amount of any physical entity involved in an interaction.

Because your examples are arbitrary, I could say that \"1 thing\" is not \"1 thing\", which in no universe or reality is/was/will be true, unless you redefine \"is\" or \"not\" (which changes the relationship). An equation doesn\\'t change what you have; it\\'s just a reformulation of it.  How could something not be what it is?  Things  are  what they  are , and things  aren\\'t  what they  aren\\'t . You\\'re claiming that this may not be true (even if in other \"universes\" or \"realities\"). It\\'s always true that 1+1=2 (when we define all of the terms in the same way), because 2 is just another representation of 1+1; they describe the same system. Mathematical operations don\\'t actually  do  anything to the relationships in equations (e.g. you don\\'t have to put one apple and another apple together to get two apples: this is one apple and that\\'s another apple; if I consider them both at the same time, they\\'re two apples); they just demonstrate another way of looking at the same thing. \\n The closest real physical examples to what you\\'re describing that I can think of are in relativity. For example, relativistic velocity addition, such that .5c + .5c isn\\'t 1c when you change reference frames (and because of the conservation of relativistic momentum and energy, the curvature of spacetime and the limit on speeds of massive objects): a stationary observer on Earth could watch two rockets either both coming towards or leaving him/her, moving in opposite directions, at half of the speed of light, but from the perspective of either one of the pilots in the rockets, the two rockets would not be moving towards or away from each other at the speed of light. By changing reference frames, you\\'ve actually  changed  the system: not all reference frames are equivalent, which basically summarizes relativity. It does not mean that .5 + .5 != 1, though, because you would have lost the necessary conditions. It means that intervals of time, speeds, lengths are different from one reference frame to another. If you don\\'t change reference frames, it\\'s still true that .5c + .5c = .5c + .5c = 1c (but .5c + .5c = 1c would be meaningless, as far as I can tell; it doesn\\'t describe anything real). The equation actually gives different symbols for velocities of the same object from one reference frame to another, to quote a physics textbook: \\n u = (v+u\\')/(1 + vu\\'/c^2)      (straight line only) \\n v : velocity of object 1 with respect to an inertial observer \\n u\\' : velocity of object 2 with respect to object 1 \\n u : velocity of object with respect to the same inertial observer \\n c : the speed of light in a vacuum', \"Say you're using a gun that will either shoot you or not based on the measurement of a particle in superposition (a qubit or the radiation or absence of radiation from a decaying atom), there's time between the measurement and your death. You'll be alive inbetween, albeit not conscious of whether the gun actually shot anything or not, or of the results of measurement, but conscious nonetheless. There's nothing that will kill you in the same instant that decoherence occurs. The decoherence caused by the measurement (whether or not anyone witnessed it) happens before the gun is fired. Basically, you're already in either the state of alive or dead before the gun is fired. Yes, within many-worlds, there should always be a live and conscious version of you in the multiverse, so if many-worlds is correct, quantum immortality is, too, but there's no reason to believe the one in this universe, considering only the quantum suicide experiment (i.e. ignoring a meteor crashing near your building and breaking the apparatus) is going to survive after the qubit is measured to be in the state that will correspond to blowing your brains out. You're already in one of the two universes. Your fate is sealed before the gun is fired. So when you get shot, you'll just be dead. Of course you can't 'experience' death, but your consciousness won't be carried along. The experiment wouldn't be a test of quantum immortality, so it wouldn't be able to distinguish between many-worlds and Copenhagen.\", 'My point is that science can\\'t demonstrate free will. Chaotic systems, for example, might have at first seemed random, but we\\'ve demonstrated that they are not. \\'Free will\\' is basically saying \\'You can\\'t explain that\\' (to quote O\\'Reilly); it\\'s the conclusion that there is not a deterministic answer, but \\'free will\\', like the randomness of QM, is something that\\'s apparent, but to conclude \\'free will\\' is to take the leap from \"I don\\'t know\" to \"it can\\'t be known\". How can you know when you\\'ve found \\'free will\\'? How can you know that something can\\'t be known? When should we tell science to give up looking for a deterministic explanation? Maybe QM is nearing that point, but \\'free will\\' makes the assumption that something isn\\'t there, just because we haven\\'t observed it yet, but we also haven\\'t looked hard enough or hit a wall like QM. Heisenberg\\'s Uncertainty Principle limits what we can observe, whether it\\'s fundamental or emergent, so although we may never be able to prove that QM is deterministic, we can\\'t know that it isn\\'t, and it isn\\'t necessary to invoke God or the nonphysical to  try  to support determinism (take the de Broglie-Bohm theory as an example of this, although it\\'s starting to look like a worse candidate with these experiments on pair production, which is the result of a fundamental, as opposed to emergent as dBB would interpret it, Uncertainty Principle).

Quantum fluctuations allow for the creation of particle-antiparticle pairs of virtual particles, and this must unequivocally be fundamental, because of its confirmation through experiment (?). Even though the uncertainty principles are easily derived from one another, does the de Broglie-Bohm theory give more weight to the energy-time one as fundamental because of the creation of virtual particles? If the energy-time uncertainty principle is fundamental, should it not follow that the momentum-space one is, too?

It is simplified because the groups do not form rigid hierarchies, and the hierarchy depends strongly on context. For example, two wolves that are subordinate to another wolf individually may be dominant to that wolf when together.

There do tend to be dominant males and females, who mate the most, but almost all pack members have the opportunity to mate.', 'Although I haven\\'t read the entire Old Testament, I don\\'t think the original version had a conventional hell at all.

I would state it as \"Things that reproduce themselves most efficiently reproduce the most\"; as that is vague enough to encompass most of what we would call life, as well as non-life which \"evolve\" through natural selection like viruses and memes. The real problem with this is statement is its lack of predictive power (it can\\'t predict what will reproduce most efficiently, that must be known) and that it isn\\'t immediately obvious whether a constant process of evolution would occur or if the reproducing entities would hit a point of maximum reproductive potential and stop evolving at that point.

These strategies would then influence each other, such as in the case of a large population of [r-strategy]( organisms leading to the development of a smaller population of carnivorous k-strategy animals.

First, it speaks to the weakness of the international community (America included) and secondly it demonstrates that there might not be universal moral revulsion to the use of non-conventional weapons. \\n The first point about weakness is obvious. It\\'s in America\\'s national interests to appear strong - which means that if America talks the talk, it must walk the walk.

I really recommend that people read at least excerpts from Hans Morgenthau\\'s  Politics Among Nations  or even something a touch more modern such as Shiping Tang\\'s  A Theory of Security for Our Time: Defensive Realism . \\n Either work, or the breadth of IR theory will demonstrate why America\\'s national interests extend beyond its borders, which is why completely removing itself from humanitarian interventions, or interventions as a whole is just a terrible idea. \\n About the rest of your question though, what would happen? \\ninternational laws and norms wouldn\\'t be as effectively enforced as they are right now. Which means that even though they\\'re enforced sporadically and inconsistently today, it would be worse in a world without American military assets to rely on. \\n Britain and France have a long and successful history of helping the cause, but neither state, or other NATO allies have the power to go it alone (or even together) without America in an armed conflict without seriously jeopardizing their own national interests. See, France and Britain don\\'t just homeport their navies and armed forces waiting for the United States to say \"Let\\'s go get\\'em boys\" - they\\'re actively enforcing their own national interests elsewhere all the time. Meaning that any emergency intervention would either go unanswered or would require other states to make sacrifices that they might not be willing to make. \\n This is where America\\'s assets come in handy. American military power is so damned strong that it can usually safeguard national interests  and  participate in emergency situations. Other states cannot do the same.', \"The Prop 8 Case (Hollingsworth v. Perry) was punted back to California because the state declined to defend the law in the courts. In turn, a group of people who supported Prop 8 decided to appeal a ruling overturning the amendment. \\n The court ruled that those people who undertook the defense of Proposition 8 did not have the standing to do so - in other words, they had no tangible legal interest (demonstrable injury, investment etc) to defend the case. \\n So the court said 'no, you don't have standing' which means that they were unable to rule on the case. Meaning, that they did not make a nation-wide ruling, and the Circuit Court (that allowed the third party to appeal) was told to dismiss the case. Californians of all sexual identities can now marry.\", 'Well first, thanks for the feedback. I really appreciate reciprocation between moderators and posters since it helps us all learn to improve the sub together. \\n I don\\'t think it\\'s fair to label it as a \\'needs citation hammer\\' - it\\'s more of a friendly request to back up claims with some sourcing. I really try to be friendly and polite in all my dealings (here and elsewhere) because I find tone tends to get lost on the internet for lack of body language or vocal cues. \\n Hypothetical answers can still have sourced replies. In essence, the point of theory is to provide explicative and predictive rigor to answers. So in other words, if there is no literature on a given topic (either because it lacks research or research is simply hard to find) one can always fall back to a more elementary source. \\n For example, if someone asks me a question about my own field (perhaps about something like \"What if the United Kingdom and the United States were competitors in the international system) and I little to no research on it (because it\\'s purely hypothetical) I would turn to political theory rather than hard empirical data. \\n So In this hypothetical situation I might turn to the writings of Jeffrey Taliaferro, Shiping Tang, John Mearsheimer, Henry Kissinger, or Hans Morgenthau. The list goes on and on. If those theorists don\\'t give me the answers I\\'m looking for, I go back farther to Kant, or Rousseau, or Hobbes, or Machiavelli. If those fail, I\\'ll dust off Thucydides. \\n My point is that anything can be sourced. The difference between speculation and a hypothesis is that the hypothesis is grounded in literature and not layman guessing. Hypotheses do not require hard and fast empirical data, philosophy and theory provide rigorous foundations for answers all the same. \\n I want to also add that I became a mod quite recently, and until then I had no idea just how many rule breaking posts are made daily. It really is mind blowing, but only mods really see the full extent of it. People might be surprised. \\n Anyway', 'A topic that I\\'m  intimately  familiar with! Hurray! \\n Alright, so let\\'s do a quick and dirty revision of realism. Realism has a few historical antecedents like Thucydides (The strong do what they will, the weak suffer what they must), Hobbes (particularly for his thoughts on the state of nature, particular that the state of nature encourages barbarism, and humans are inherently in conflict), and E.H. Carr for his 1938 book  The Twenty Years Crisis  in which he tears apart the international liberalism of the 1918-2938 period. \\n Carr argues that liberalism as envisioned by Woodrow Wilson failed because it could not stop the world from going to war in 1938. Liberalism at its core argues that people are inclined to peace and believe that peace is inherently possible. Peace can be achieved by institutions and norms etc. Except these institutions and norms failed to stop WWII. \\n So after the war, Hans Morgenthau comes along with his 1948 book  Politics Among Nations . Morgenthau lays out the [6 Principles of Realism]( that form the foundation of the entire school of realism as we understand it today. Not to say that every point is still relevant, but they\\'re tremendously important for context. Anyway, Morgenthau\\'s stuff holds up for a while, primarily because it could explain the state of the international system in the post-war period. \\n In 1957, Kenneth Waltz comes along and argues that Morgenthau got some stuff right, but he also got some stuff wrong. Whereas Morgenthau emphasized the importance of human nature (I.E. Hobbesianism), Waltz preferred his structural understanding of the international system. In  Man, the State, and War  he argues that there are three images (or levels of analysis) in the study of war. First, he argues is the study of human nature (like Morgenthau\\'s work), the second is that wars occur because of domestic structures. Finally, the third image is systemic. Waltz argues that structure rules all - the international system is controlled by balancing, bandwagonning, alliances etc. \\n In 1975, Waltz adds to his earlier theory by arguing that the international system is inherently anarchical, and in anarchy states are ordinated by their material capabilities (I.E. Power). \\n But oh shit!  What happens in the late 1980s and early 1990s? Right, the collapse of the Soviet Union. But why is this important? Because Waltz\\'s theory suggests that in a balanced system the Soviet Union should not have collapsed as it did. And when a theory loses predictive value, what the hell good is it anyway? \\n So the 1990s was a bit of a chaotic time for realists, because all of the sudden Waltz was sort of caught with his theoretical pants down. However, a bunch of theorists start looking back to classical realism (like Morgenthau) for guidance. Eventually, neo-classical realism comes around and it\\'s sort of a synthesis between Structural Realism (Waltz) and Classical Realism (Morgenthau). There\\'s a great article out there by Gideon Rose that outlines the theory cohesively, but simply put it places a premium on relative material capability within the international system. However, it includes a bunch of other ideas like perception, and willingly incorporates domestic variables. \\n Neo-classical realism is sort of still relevant, but it gets a bad rap for being \\'intellectually inconsistent\\', which is snarky academic talk for \\'you\\'ve created a theory with contradictions.\" Anyway, many still use it, but it\\'s really only good for analyses in which material power matters. It wouldn\\'t make much sense to use a material power analysis for a discussion of say... Mexico\\'s role in the international system. \\n However, structural realism gave way to two related and somewhat useful realist theories. First and perhaps more famous, John Mearsheimer\\'s [ Offensive Realism ]( argues that states are power maximizers, not interested in bandwagonning or balancing. Suffice it to say, it\\'s new-ish because  Tragedy of Great Power Politics  was only published in 2001. It\\'s new... but no one really uses it? Certainly not foreign policy people in government - it\\'s way too aggressive and would never make a popular foreign policy as whole. \\n The other sort of \"cousin\" of structural realism is [ Defensive Realism ]( Defensive realism holds that states are interested in survival like every other realist theory, except that instead of power maximization and material capability at the fore - security is the main variable. Defensive realists tend to incorporate geography, technology, offensive-defense balances, alliances, and finally a state\\'s foreign policy can be the product of domestic considerations - not just responses to the international system. \\n Defensive realism makes a lot of sense to use when you\\'re doing an analysis of middle power, or low-power states. I know I used it heavily for my thesis on Ballistic Missile Defense in Canada. \\n Finally, there\\'s some work being on with social psychological approaches to inside-outside dynamics with realism. Basically, realists assume that states are antagonistic because of inherent differences. However, there\\'s been no way to test it until recently. I need to find the paper I\\'m thinking about, but instead of first-image human nature theorists who use non-empirical philosophy, social psychologists are trying to do a human nature explanation using test subjects. Look up Social Identity Theory and realism, it\\'s pretty hot. \\n So', \"It depends on the circumstances surrounding NATO's call to action. \\n The North Atlantic Treaty is  very  specific in the situations it would allow for the mutual defense clause to be enacted. \\n >  Article 5  The  Parties  agree that an  armed attack against one or more of them  in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all and consequently they agree that, if such an armed attack occurs, each of them, in exercise of the right of individual or collective self-defence recognised by Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations, will assist the Party or Parties so attacked by taking forthwith, individually and in concert with the other Parties, such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force, to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area. \\n Article 5 can't be invoked unless the attack happens against a signatory - which Ukraine is not. Attacking Ukraine wouldn't enable Article 5 unless the attack is considered to somehow directly impacted a NATO member (Poland, Lithuania, etc) \\n That's the reason why the US and Canada are leaving it to the Europeans. It's not that we don't care or don't see the strategic shitstorm headed our way - It's that we have no legitimate grounds for intervention just yet.\", \"Alright, I'll risk the potential for acrimony and endless inbox messages telling me why I'm wrong. To put this in context, I completed my graduate education in International Relations with a specific focus on American-Canadian security issues. \\n Snowden's leaks run the risk of weakening American power on the international scene if we accept that power is inclusive of material (guns, warships, tanks etc) and non-material factors (influence, authority etc). The leaks pose a problem because they serve to embarrass the United States in the face of its allies and demonstrate weakness in its internal security processes in what should be some of the most secure institutions of the state. \\n So Snowden managed to dent American influence among its allies (even if everyone does spy on one another, it still doesn't look good) and now states that are genuinely interested in weakening American power have cause to believe that they might be able to successfully challenge it in ways not previously possible. Essentially, it's a problem that emboldens potential enemies and makes allies less keen to back American interests. \\n So why is a weakened America a problem? The United States has actually successfully maintained international peace through its existence as a world hegemon (especially if you suscribe to [Hegemonic Stability Theory]( and a strong America lends economic stability because of its immense consumer base and the fact that the USD is still the reserve currency of the world. So remember, peace through power, stability though power. These are fairly core principles of [realism]( So with the United States' non-material power weakened, it's not able to project itself as effectively as it was once able to do. \\n Now, let me caveat a bunch of stuff I've just said. The damage is  proportional  - so I'm not saying 'Snowden will cause international chaos'. What I'm suggesting is that his leaks, in the greater scheme of international relations has the  potential  to make life difficult for the United States and its allies. The United States has  a lot  of power to go around, so no one can say what the immediate impact will be. My argument is simply that there is the  potential  for a decrease in non-material power - which negatively impacts the United States and its allies. \\n Also, my arguments don't care about internal American politics or law. I don't care if what he did was illegal, or legal, those are inconsequential to my argument. He might be legally justified, he might be ethically/morally justified, and that's fine. But in this analysis, ethics, morals and law mean precisely bunk. Power (in this analysis) is essentially all that matters. What I personally think about the morals/ethics/law of all this is completely separate (but it may or may not be similar) to my analysis of the international implications of his actions.\", 'This should be fun. To give my answers a little more context, I\\'m Canadian and not American, so the answer to my last question might be coloured by a slightly external viewpoint. \\n >Why do you consider yourself a liberal? \\n I consider myself somewhere between a classic economic liberal and a neoliberal. I love free markets and enterprise, I think it does more harm than good from a practical perspective. However, there is room for the government to act as a redistributive force for good - hence why I barely qualify as a neoliberal. \\n >What disagreements (major) do you have with Libertarianism? \\n Oy, this will be long, but here we go \\n Libertarianism is generally ahistorical  - What I mean by this is that those who argue for pure libertarianism generally do not do so from a historicist perspective, preferring to rely on normative judgments. An example of a historicist philosophy is something like Marxism, where Marx used history to demonstrate that the proletariat has been continually subjugated by the propertied class. I\\'m not saying that I buy all of Marx\\'s arguments (otherwise I would call myself a Marxist, not a Classical Liberal/Neoliberal), but I think in the absence of empirical data, historicism lends at least a little heft to philosophy. \\n I believe in collective identities/rights  - What I mean is that I believe people hold rights by virtue of collective identity. For example, I /u/thornplebeian hold rights by virtue of being a Canadian citizen. I don\\'t hold rights by virtue of being an individual separate from my collective Canadian identity. Should that identity change, the nature of my rights also change. \\n One of the things I think libertarianism gets wrong (by virtue of my next point, that I hope to get to soon) is that we all posses intersecting collective identities, which are subject to different sorts of societal pressures that can impinge on certain rights we are owed as members of groups. For example, I\\'m Canadian, gay, white etc. I derive a sense of self from my belonging to those collectivities. Much like Marx, who never argued for the rights of individual workers and only workers as a group, I think collective identities are  critical  to understanding social behaviour. Now, libertarianism places a dramatic emphasis on individuality (and individual agency, that I\\'ll get to shortly), and you can\\'t reconcile libertarian philosophy on individual rights with the existence of collective identities (hello ahistoricism at work!). \\n Libertarianism is too reductionist  - What I mean is that it reduces the complexity of social interaction down to the nature, wants and needs of the individual. Like I said before, collective identities exist and operate in society, therefore it makes little sense to reduce our understanding of societal rights to individual people. \\n The Structure and Agency Problem  ( for reference  is that libertarianism places an emphasis on  choice . Individuals have the  choice  to behave freely, and can be expected to sink or swim at their own design. The problem is that not everyone necessarily has this choice, and they\\'re subject to  structural  impediments that prevent them from accessing all available options to make a choice. Now, I\\'m not nearly as strict a structuralist as maybe a Marxist would be, but I still think that structure prevents the selection of choice (i.e. the use of agency) enough to prevent libertarianism from being an actual workable thing. Now this is where I sort of want to go off the rails and pick apart this things called \"Socialist Libertarianism\" (yes, I realize there are books on it), but for me the defining feature of socialism/marxism/communism/gramscian thought is  structure , and libertarianism completely throws out structure in the name of agency. It\\'s like saying \"I\\'m a structuralist who believes in pure agency\" - What?! \\n Anyway, back on the rails just in time to wrap up. Basically I think the']": "Based on the postings, the user is interested in international relations, specifically in the areas of American national interests, military interventions, human rights violations, international laws and norms, realism theory, NATO, and the impact of Snowden's leaks on American power and influence in international relations.", "[\"I am doubtful that this will work.  The last time the left was truly united was under FDR, there have been some ups, but overall the last 70 years has been a gradual disintegration of the FDR coalition.  Just looking at the kinds of people FDR had for vice president, Wallace was debatably Buddhist, and clearly very leftest in ideology.  In fact he was attacked for being to extreme which led FDR to choose a new vice president in his last campaign where the safer choice was either Truman (a moderate anti corruption figure) or Justice Douglas, who proved to be one of the supreme court justices furthest to the left. \\n The democratic party at the time included socialists communists, blacks, southerners, populists, the poor, and new money.  This coalition broke down, the southern dixiecrats left first, and by 1992 the very few of these factions were still supported.\\nWhy was this?  Well to understand that I say we look at how the Republican party became the fairly disciplined and unified party they have been until fairly recently.  They talked about ideology.  Before Reagan you had the social conservatives duking it out with the libertarians.  Reagan layed out and preached how he thought the economy should work, how he thought society should work, and it wasn't that people necessarily agreed with it, it was that over time hearing it they became indoctrinated. The ideas Reagan layed out for how government should work did not meet the reality of his policies, it didn't matter, it did not match the thinking of most republicans at the time, but it did by the end of his term.  He unified the factioned republican party by giving an explanation however flawed of how things worked, and the people listened and we today still talk about economics, deficits, and military under his shadow.  Times have changed, but noone has given the American people a new ideology. \\n Meanwhile democrats have played the party of not them, of being distinctly non ideological, in order to try and keep their fractured alliance together.  It doesn't work.  I think Obama had a chance to do this, to lay out a new leftest ideology.  He has instead opted to be a political pragmatist, and has done a good job at getting difficult changes through.\\nWhile these policy goals are great, the media, the public, and the left are all disappointed because they still have their seperate ideologies and the democrats are still talking under a Reagan based framework, where the default position they pragmatically explain away from is that of trickle down economics, and the idea that government is bad.\\nDeep Water Horizon was a chance to preach and convert people to the merits of environmental regulation, the dangers of further dependence on oil.  Instead it managed to be a blip that seems to have changed politics less than the much smaller event in Alaska about 2 decades prior.  That is a failure to promote a message. \\n I know any of you dilligent enough to read this far are thinking, isn't that the point? Isn't that why we need this, we need a coherent message?  As much as I like grassroots movements for change, the answer is NO.  Even if Greens, socialists, anarchists could come up with the ideal platform, it wouldn't matter.  It wasn't the christian right and the libertarians who decided to settle their differences.  It is a top down change, we need to start having democrats willing to lay out a new paradigm for how the economy, jobs, and government work.  For what role we as citizens should have in society and what role government should have in our lives.  Until someone can stand up and confidently deliver that message, until we can create a new paradigm the coalitions can't meld.  Because every side has their own policy motivators their own pet issues, and it takes an overarching picture for how things work that will unite us.  We need to have someone stand up and explain how under this philosophy all your different goals will be resolved.  We will still be mad, and the socialists will still have different goals than the populists, and the greens will be pissed that more isn't being done in this area, but we will all talk about the issues the same way.  That change can't be made grassroots though, that change has been something a figure with a dominant personality injects among the populous.\", \"I think this is true... but I think it was kind of more complicated. \\n If I am wrong on any of this someone please correct me, but this is my understanding.\\nBanking became a major issue in Iceland, and the conservative party had been pushing banking deregulation, and moving to big banking money.  In this process which started in the late 80's and picked up through the 90's Icelandic wealth shot up FAST.  The country had unprecedented growth.  All the wealth and value that they had however was from foreign investors.  Iceland has 300,000 people and its big export is fish.  The money that was being poured into their banks was coming from all over Europe. \\n Where in the United States bailing out wall street, helped the banking industry, it also helped every business that had things invested in that industry.  These industries lobbied and fought to save their skin, because the downfall of wallstreet would have hurt them significantly, it wasn't just the banks.  In Iceland all these businesses that would be effected were external to the country.  They would have been essentially been bailing out their banking industry for the sake of Europe, not Iceland.  When they let their banks fail, it pissed off the international community, and hurt their economy in the short term extremely, but they would recover faster because they essentially didn't bail out a bunch of oversees business.  The UK even put them on a list of terrorist nations so they could stop the banks from recalling money from UK based businesses, as they have a policy of not giving money to terrorist nations. \\n If we were to judge the US economy only on wall street (and some fishing) I think the US would look like our recovery was going quite a bit faster than it looks now as well.\", 'As a sophomore in highschool we watched the movie version of this story.  It was low budget and my friend and I were pretty fascinated with it wondering if it could actually happen.  What I am about to say is pretty unbelievable to me looking back on it, but these things get out of control really really fast. \\n Just a few weeks after watching this film my friend and I were off to be outdoor school counselors.  This third guy who would wear black trenchcoats and went by the name Neo even though his name was Neil was a counselor we met and befriended.  While that short lived trend of Matrix kids was always strange to me Neo won me over with his opening line, \"My parents had raised me with the promise that one day George Lucas would would make more star wars movies, that is why it starts with 4. When I went to the theater and saw episode one I felt how Jerry Falwell would feel if in the second coming Jesus was black.\" \\nThis was the kind of politically incorrect thinking I could get behind.  So my friend and I started talking to Neo about all kinds of things.  Eventually the Wave came up.  My friend and I had joked about what it would be like to do that in the camp, but this was one of the many random hypothetical\\'s we did all the time.  Neo however thought this idea was fantastic.  He latched onto it instantly and said we had to do it.\\nAfter having a conversation where we kind of said we were going to do it we all went off to run our cabins or teach our activities or something. This was back in like 2002 and I don\\'t remember the timeline exactly, but I can tell you that Neo got his whole cabin to draw little waves on the back of their nametags and start doing the wave sign.  I think I remained pretty removed from the entire thing, but like the teachers account says it is hard to remember.  Your brain really doesn\\'t want to let you think of yourself as an instigator to something as powerful as this kind of fascist energy.\\nOn the first day one of the creepiest images in my psyche is remembering Neo with a kid looking at me from accross the field.  He pointed at me and did the wave, and then the 6th grader did the wave, and I did it back with this thought in my mind like what the hell are we doing.\\nSo I knew a couple kids had started doing the wave to eachother, and that Neo had told them that my friend and I both were also part of the wave.  One of the kids I had in my soil class had a wave on the back of his name tag and when the other kids were finding bugs, one of the activities part of the soil program, he started talking really fast to me about it.  He was super excited.  He wanted to see the back of my nametag and see if I had a wave.  I didn\\'t, but put one on in front of him.  We talked a little and you could tell he was super happy to have an upper hand connection with the student running his activity.\\nThe kids started spreading the wave around and it was incredible how fast it grew.  I never indoctrinated anyone or really did anything but just because through the grapevine people had heard I was part of it I was getting extra respect from kids that were not in my cabin and these kids would come and talk to me about the wave.\\nWe didn\\'t do many of the disciplinary things expressed in the original, just a little sense of hierarchy and prestige was all it took.  It was just the desire to belong to something and the idea that they were that gave us extra authority.  I think it was during this second day that one of the campers in my cabin came up to me and told me he was now part of the wave.  He was trying to convince the other campers in our bunk that they should join. \\nI kind of asked him questions like why do you want to be in the wave?\\nWhat do you think the point of the wave is?\\nAnd he said you are in it, its cool come on.  And vague little bursts of excitement.  This kid just loved the idea of being in something secret and something that meant he belonged.  If memory serves there were kids from a few different elementary schools there, so this was a way for them to co-mingle with the kids from other schools.  It was the next morning that things started getting more out of control.\\nKids started running up and flipping peoples name tags yelling your not in the wave your not in the wave.  The camp started to become aware that something was going on.  Wave kids were downright mean to non wave kids at times, and on top of that, they stopped listening or respecting the non wave highschool counselors or adults. \\n The main counselor who oversaw us came and pulled Neo my friend and I out and talked to us about the wave.  He seperated Neo off because I think most of the kids had said he was the leader of it, but talked to my friend and I as well.  He said that a kid had refused to do what he told him to because he only listened to other Wave members.  The guy started asking us about what the hell was going on. \\n We just kind of told him, and downplayed our involvement, in a way throwing Neo under the bus.  In another way I think we really were far more cursory than him.  The head counselor basically told us that we had to end it and that he was going to write about it in our files but we didn\\'t get in any serious trouble.  He made us feel really guiltiy, \"outdoor school is going to be cut, and the last thing we need is a story like this giving them a reason to cut it.\"  We felt terrible, but the thing was that with very little effort, even from Neo, this thing took a life of its own. \\n It wasn\\'t that hard to end it.  We just told the kids that excluding people is bad, we neither had the capability or the escalation to warrant the kind of breakdown that happened in the school that did it.  It just kind of sits as some weird half memory that I ask myself how the hell did that happen?\\nThe point is that if you can make people feel a sense of community and connectedness through giving them something special like a reward, it can be a very powerful tool.  It is startling how quickly that kind of thing gets out of hand.', \"This is the Reddit Comment I was born to write, and it is on my freaking Reddit Birthday, so read it reddit. \\n My short answer for how I would change the US system, (or how I would like to see my state legislature work, if numbers were adjusted) \\n I like the bicameral system and think it creates an oppertunity. \\n \\n Senate: Simple Instant Runoff Voting with one winner, and keep terms the same. \\n \\n House: \\n1)  Have multi candidate districts out of which four representatives are elected, using a multi candidate Single Transferrable Vote method. \\n2) Up the number of representatives in the house of representatives to 1000. \\n \\n \\n Now here is the long explanation of why I think this is the best system. \\n First we need to look at the goal of represenation.  In my mind we are trying to take the complex and scattered views throughout the country, have representatives that can speak on behalf of those views, and then create the best compromise policies possible by looking at the totality of these different viewpoints. \\n \\n Remember originally in the United States Senators were not elected.  It was not mandatory to have senators elected until the 17th amendment in 1913.  The concept was that you would have state interests represented by the appointment of senators by the state (who were elected by the voting public), and then you would have the house which was the direct voice of the people.  The idea was different viewpoints would create better policy.  I am not suggesting going back to this but think it is important when considering what the purpose of having two legislative bodies is, if both are elected the same way. \\n \\n The system of voting in my new Senate is IRV, which has been explained throughout this forum.  Here are two videos if you don't know what it is. \\n[Explained with every day life example]( \\n [Explained in a more traditional way]( \\n \\n \\n Now what effect does this have on the kinds of candidates elected, and the kinds of campaigns run?  Well it means that the candidates elected tend to be more moderate (I know sad for many of us, but that is where the house of reps comes in).  Because we take out the smallest supported candidates first, and let them go to their second choice until a candidate has achieved a majority, we ensure that the candidate is one that is favored at least to some extent, by at least half the population.  Meanwhile voters now can express their preference for smaller parties by voting for them in their early choices which allows these issues to not only gain visability, but gives the more mainstream or popular candidates a chance and a strategic reason to want to court these votes in order to become their second or third choice.  This is also how this system can lead to less negative campaigning. \\n So we have candidates that should approximate the political center of there state in the senate who have been elected by courting minority or single issue party views that seem to resonate with voters.  Sound good right? \\n *Now we move onto the house. \\n The house has a less talked about election scheme, although it is actually similar to the preferential voting used in IRV, and thus the actual way you vote will be completely consistent.\\nThe way this system differs is that you are no longer cutting out the smallest candidates until there is one candidate with a majority, instead we will cut small candidates until we have 4 candidates each with more than 20% of the vote. \\nHere is a video to show how this works [Gummy Bears Voting!]( \\n This system gives minority representation, as any candidate popular enough to achieve 20% support in a district can be a representative. \\n What this means is that now you would have socialists, libertarians, greens, constitution party, working families party, neocon's, business parties, evangelicals, and ideologies of all stripes represented throughout the districts in the country.  These different groups would come together in congress, forming Caucasus's most of the time with no single party able to pass legislation on its own.  Instead the issues that would be passed, would be those that parties could come to agree on.  This means that different kinds of issues would be talked about, pushed, and would be able to pass the house than normally rise to the top of american politics.  Look at issues that cut the political parties, Physician Assisted Suicide laws for example.  Libertarians (who tend to be republicans) tend to like these laws, as do many liberals, yet more mainstream democrats are more warry.  Under our system that means no one wants to touch this issue as it alienates them from their base.  The only states that have the law passed it through referendum, with little support by established politicians.  Other examples are Marijuana legalization, cutting defense spending, and many others.  I find it easier to think of policies I support, but this would really create an environment where many policies I don't like would gain traction as well, however I think it is a better democratic process.\\nSo to counter the moderate nature of the Senate, we instead have voting districts which ensure that in each region many viewpoints can be represented.  (Right now Rural Democrats and Urban Republicans have little voice).  This makes the house the inovative body, coming up with solutions and legislation while the senate ensures nothing to crazy gets passed. \\n \\n Now onto why I would up the house to 1000.  It comes down to campaign financing.  This election system in general makes it more difficult for moneyed interests to get their way.  Under the current system it is easy to pick winners in an election, and easy for moneyed interests to get involved in primaries early to ensure sympathetic candidates rise to the top.  However to do this to all four winning candidates is much more difficult, as each one only needs 20% of their district to support them to win.  It is much easier to get 20% through grassroots efforts, than it is to get 50%.  There are a million things to say about how having more candidates and lower winning threshold would effect campaign money, but I don't want to get to bogged down in it, and instead ask that you think about it yourself as it isn't that hard to figure out. \\n \\n Now the 1000 house members.  If the purpose of lobbying and putting big money into politics is to buy/influence/gain sympathetic votes, then one way to make this much more difficult is add dramatically more votes.  If one congressmen is only one vote of 435 and maybe one of a handful on an important committee, then that is a much more valuable position to buy than if they are 1 in 1000, and one of 2 handfuls in a committee.  This makes lobbying a hell of a lot more expensive, and that is in a first past the post system, in this multi candidate STV system it would have even more of an impact.\\nIn my mind this means more decisions will be made on the merits of the question at hand rather than pissing off the wrong people for reelection concerns.\", 'I likely will get some crap for saying this on /r Socialism... but \\n I think the first thing we need to do before having this conversation is define some terms.  When you say socialism do you mean like straight up Karl Marx socialism?  Or are you talking Democratic Socialism in Scandanavian countries? \\n Are you talking about socialism as an extreme point or as a direction on a spectrum between socialism and capitalism every country exists somewhere on, with none ever being at either extreme. \\n I am going to assume you mean the latter as that is what is debated in most nations.  The idea of complete capitalism or complete socialism are unclear, ill defined, have never existed in practice, and I am doubtful could even actually exist as interests would be there to fix the problems that would occur in either system. \\n So now that we are talking about whether to have socialist or controlled/planned economic policies, or a laissez faire policy is something that most countries look at for each political issue that comes up.  However these are questions of economic policy and for the most part are not completely related to voting or political systems.  Hyper Capitalist dictatorships exist, and like mentioned before some of the most socialist countries in the world are scandanavian and have more proportionally elected governmental bodies than most of the world, this means that these are arguably some of the most democratic nations in the world.', 'Apart from the institutional power the representatives gain over multiple terms, which is what I assume you are referring to, there are many more reasons people vote to keep their representative. \\n The first reason is because we live in ideological pockets.  Redistricting is blamed for this, and is a huge problem, but really it happens naturally just as much.  The fact of the matter is that Urban vs. Rural is a very very real divide in political opinions in the country.  While everyone hates congress as a whole, it is largely because congress is not made up of people like their representative, who represents an area where most people think in that same way. \\n So unless you are talking about a primary challenger, the person who runs against that person in a two party system is always going to be someone most of that district can not stomach. \\n So is the answer to have more competitive primaries?  Again probably not, because when you have a big year for one side or the other you would see a massive swing.  It was and is competitive primaries by an organized base that is making the republicans be so hard line.  You vote for a tax increase and you know they will gun for you. \\n In my mind there are a few true solutions. \\n First one is not my favorite, but likely the one our founding fathers wanted.  More politicians/Smaller Districts.  Increase the size of the house of representatives to say 5000 members.  All of a sudden instead of a Rep representing 750,000 people, more than the mayor of nearly every American city, they instead would represent about 75,000.  This would make elections more local and make the candidates hypothetically less tied to the national party...  All of a sudden door to door campaigning and getting local groups engaged is the most important thing in an election. \\n However while this is the simplest answer, and arguably the answer our founding fathers wanted as many historians think the part of the constitution [on district size was a misprint and they tried to immediately fix it by amendment, which failed]( I tend to think that the size of modern media markets could lead to this type of representation becoming even more party driven.  Maybe a third party would gain some seats, and internal party caucuses would have more power, but still the fate of the party would depend more on national news of the parties image than any individual candidate. \\n That is why I think the better solution is the one pretty much all Americans hate.  I want to impose a style of proportional representation where each district has multiple candidates.  I would advocate [this style of election]( with four member districts.  This would bring in third parties, and increase the regional diversity of existing parties. \\n Imagine if there were rural democrats and urban republicans.  It would be like 30 years ago.', \"I am actually sad this number isn't higher. \\n It is hard to find someone that is 'all' bad.  It is a stupid question to ask if someone is 'all' bad.  If you were going to answer honestly you have to say no, because every major world event effects some people positively and some people negatively.  We as processors of information can say Hitler was terrible, but that doesn't mean he was 'all' bad. \\n Education systems around the world try to demonize people and make some topics off limits.  If you ask me what you are measuring here is how taboo of a subject is Hitler, and we shouldn't care about it becoming less taboo, because we can pretty easily give a complete and honest description of Hitler, and people will still think he was a bad guy.\"]": "Based on the user's reddit posting history, it seems that the user is primarily interested in politics and political ideologies.

It\\'s not reasonable in any way. \\n However; If you as a libertarian are tired of being told you are really an anarchist... the first thing you need to do is purge all the anarchists from the Libertarian movement. \\n Libertarian = Limited government. \\n Anarchist = No Government. \\n The reason why Mr Red in your article, or Mr. Crying Eagle (as Mr. Red would call him) dismisses the idea of Libertarianism immediately is because too many self professed libertarians preach anarchism and call it \"Libertarian philosophy\".', 'I\\'m always taken by people who claim the internet was this awesome revolution in thought that would have never happened without the guy at CERN and \"the government\". (as if Uncle Sam himself was up in the lab with a pen and a pad tryin to pull this new data packet transfer off... which, as far as my Wikki diploma tells me that was a guy at BBN Technologies in Boston...) \\n But let\\'s take a step back. I am proposing that there was a very long line that led there, and government was hardly the cause of anything. \\n The first version of the internet was the Pneumatic Tube Transport that allowed people to quickly pass documents back and forth from desk to desk. Around the same time came the telegraph and telephone (which was chosen over the fiber optic photophone device that he was working on needed fiberoptic lines to work and fiberoptics hadn\\'t been invented.) Then came the fax machine (Wikki diploma says that was a guy at RCA for modern version in the 20s, but a guy in 1850s for original), which I argue, for all intensive purpose, the fax was the first internet... but I will be happy to concede it was not as close as the ARPANET... \\n The guy who \"created\" the internet didn\\'t create the concept of electric transferal of information across vast distance using telephone lines... that was called a \"Fax\". He didn\\'t create the computers either. He also didn\\'t create the idea of a computer network.... He didn\\'t create the electricity required to run all of that shit either... \\n In fact, when you think on it... that shitty 16K modem isn\\'t even comparable to the DSL of today... If you insist on calling that an internet, then surely you can call fax machines \"the internet\" as well. \\n I agree, I am no expert. I\\'m sure there are many factual steps in the evolution process of the internet that I have missed... but surely the overwhelming components that led to this great \"Internet\" invention were not funded by government research in any way. So why the god like worship of government on the topic? YES! God-like. It\\'s very religious.

I'm also wondering why this trip down memory lane would lead you to think Saddam is a great guy. \\n >When they went through there revolution in 1979, Hussain became terrified of a similar revolution occurring in his own Shia lands. Cut to the point, there was a huge war between them lasting a decade. \\n You must be Iranian. Why else would you leave out the Ayatolla pushing for the revolution to continue to Iraq? That isn't to say that bloodthirsty saddam didn't see an opportunity of crisis in a revolutionary Iran to take over a long time enemy mind you, but Iran is hardly innocent. \\n >(By the way, for all the democracy you talk about, the vote ended up being split almost entirely among ethnic lines, as everybody expected) \\n That's the way democracy works.

You are either \"Pro-Marriage-Equality\" or you are a homophobic oppressor. \\n The people on the right play the same game - calling homosexuals evil and all that shit. Those guys suck ass too. \\n Here is the curve ball you weren\\'t looking for; \\n Gay Marriage should be a religious right, defended by the 1st amendment . \\n You see, since the 90s if not earlier, gay couples have been getting married in all sorts of non-catholic churches. Non-denominational... whatever the term. \\n Under the 1st amendment those people have a  religious right  to have their religious marriage acknowledged equally with Catholics and Jews and Protestants and Muslims and all the rest... \\n Likewise - atheist and agnostic groups share the same right! \\n Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion,  or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.[1]', 'So, I would characterize the evolution of Donald Trump coverage as; \\n 1) First they laughed at him, as we all did. The constant rubber-necking back up in the media as they all filled their papers and screens with images of and opinions on the trainwreck in action. \\n 2) Then they supported him - [Over the course of the campaign (up to march), he has earned close to $2 billion worth of media attention, about twice the all-in price of the most expensive presidential campaigns in history.  ]( \\n I argue this is intentional. In my life experience, it seems to me the media supported Romney, McCain and Bush in a similar \"free media\" way, although I admit I don\\'t have a link like the NYT one above! The difference here is certainly stark. None of them were aided that much by the media. Intentional or unintentional results of mocking - the result is 2 campaigns worth of coverage for one guy... for free. \\n 3) The Clinch. In the past, once the nomination was clinched, the media then turns on the chosen republican. I saw it the most with Bush, constantly printing pictures of him with his eye half closed and his mouth open... as if that was the only photo their digital camera captured... But it was the same for McCain, who went from hero to dottering old fool... and Romeny, who went from Businessman to Mr. Monopoly\\'s Evil Cousin Captain Vulture... \\n And the question is - will this post-clinch coverage backfire or work with The Donald? Afterall... how do you make him look bad? Donald is the king of \"I\\'m Rubber, You\\'re Glue\" slinging. \\n I make no bones about being a #NeverTrump republican. But I do have to say that Trump reminds me of Obama in one specific way; The more you try to make fun of him or claim he is incompetent or doesn\\'t deserve it... the more people like him. \\n I think that same thing happened with Bush in a lot of ways too, that many still liked him and even liked him more when he was attacked - but the tide turned on him after the market crash. \\n What I think political media coverage should be about: (But probably won\\'t be.) \\n Trump has a very specific mathematical equation to overcome in the General: \\n The GOP can\\'t afford to lose any votes. And they most certainly will lose many of the NeverTrump republicans (Like me). \\n The only way to offset that loss is to pull from the 94 million people that didn\\'t bother to vote in 2012. \\n 60 million voted Romney. \\n So say Trump loses 10% of that 60 million - people like me. \\n All he needs is to pull 6.5% of that 94 million that didn\\'t vote to make up for the lost #NeverTrump vote. \\n If he pulls 10% from that \"We Dont Vote\" block he would probably win it all! \\n People who claim that there will be some flood of Bernie supporters supporting Trump are out of their fucking minds. Democrats will not be divided like Trump has divided the GOP. \\n I see lots of articles like this.
