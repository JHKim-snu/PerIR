Statistical significance testing requires subjective judgment in setting a predetermined acceptable probability (ranging between 0 and 1.0) of making an inferential error caused by the sampling error--getting samples with varying amounts of \"flukiness\"--inherent in sampling. Sampling error can only be eliminated by gathering data from the entire population.', 'If all you want is elasticity, then the simplest economic model would be a Cobb-Douglas demand function. \\n Q(good a)=c\u2022Pa^alpha \u2022Pb^beta \u2022Income^gamma \\n In this equation everything is multiplied.

Fisher introduced the t form for it fitted in with his theory of degrees of freedom.

Don\\'t get that confused with what the market price is: I might be  willing  to spend $2,000 for someone to write some computer code for me.  The fact that someone has already done it and posted it on their website for free does not make it valueless. If we simply assume that the labor theory of value says that the value of something is a function of the amount of labor it takes to create it (and even when you go deeper than that, the theory doesn\\'t get any better), let me give you a few counter examples to show you how the amount of labor that goes into something is largely irrelevant to the value. \\n 1) Suppose there is a piece of wood sitting on the ground.  If we just leave it there for 3 years, perhaps it changes color, and people think it is more beautiful, and willing to pay more for it.  Therefore, its value has increased, and no one did anything. \\n 2) Suppose this artist you refer to has this $1,000 piece you refer to.  But next week, that art either a) Gets more fashionable and is now worth $2,000, or b) Goes out of fashion, and is now worthless.

How much do you value the quality of life of a Polar Bear, and value that he shouldn\\'t have to see oil wells in ANWAR?  How much would you value NOT having a wind turbine whooshing over your house? Again, labor has nothing to do with these things, and yet we value them, and are willing to pay (or give up things) to see that nature, the air, and the environment are preserved. \\n 4) Last point: Think of all of the things that labor does that has no value, or negative value.  The student\\'s argument on a math problem: \"But I worked so HARD on it!\" Well, it is still wrong. I often spend many months on a research question, to run into a dead end.  No one values that.

All in all, this could result in thousands of regressions running. \\n 4) The problem for econometricians is that that these methods rarely produce the  correct  model (in situations where the correct model is known), the choice of what to maximize is somewhat arbitrary, doing a forwards and backwards method will often lead you to different models, none of the theory or knowledge about the problem being solved is used...\", \"No professor wants anyone to do a continuity correction like this with numbers so large, and the difference in the answer being practically zero.

The word 'spin' or angular momentum is simply a byproduct of the mathematical solution to the Schrodinger Equation, as the mathematics that describe this particular phenomena of electrons is very similar to angular momentum in classical mechanics.

However, the property is real, and it is the foundation of electromagnetic effects.\", \"I wrote an earlier post on the wave-particle duality of light but realized it didn't actually address the OP's question - that is, what exactly are electrons doing. I'll try to address that here: \\n As everyone probably knows, atoms are essentially made of two components, the nuclei and the electrons. For all chemical phenomena (excluding nuclear reactions), the nuclei stays bound with the atom. However, the electrons, like the OP has alluded to, swarms around the nuclei like a cloud. \\n There are  regions  where the electrons are likely to be found, but in quantum mechanics, you can't say for sure where the electron  is , this is a quantum mechanical effect called the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle that results in the description of the location of the electron as a  probability distribution , not a precise location. These probability distributions take the shape of spheres, dumbbells, and other shapes that become the s,p,d,f orbitals that you hear so much about in chemistry. Most importantly, the population of these orbitals using the Aufbau process is what leads to the Periodic Table of Elements. \\n Okay, that's how electrons function around atoms. But the REALLY interesting stuff is in how electrons from different atoms interact. The outermost electrons (valence electrons) are not that strongly bound to the host atom, they are easily exchanged with other atoms. This exchange process can lead to sharing of electrons (covalent bonding), direct exchange (which leads to charge imbalance and ionic bonding), or a bunch of metal atoms can be found in a  sea  of delocalized electrons that zoom about (metallic bonding). As you see, chemical bonding is completely based on how electrons interact! In this sense, electrons form the 'glue' of nature. \\n The dynamics of electron exchange also leads to a great number of interesting phenomena, such as reduction-oxidation reactions (corrosion, battery power), electron excitation (solar cells), ionization (different types of microscopes), catalysis, and much more.

However, the ways the energy  can  do work is a function of the boundary conditions. For example, let\\'s say I put a lot of energy into a balloon with fixed volume and also into a balloon with freely-movable volume. The equilibrium conditions of this balloon is different, right? One will expand (free volume) one will get hotter (fixed volume). So it seems like, in order to describe the equilibrium conditions, we require a very good way to describe free energy while taking in consideration the boundaries. \\n These different ways of describing the free energy are done as legendre transforms of the internal energy U. How to do it is below, if you don\\'t care just skip ahead. \\n ELIamaGraduateMaterialsScientist: \\nThere are intensive and extensive variables and they are conjugates of each other. Intensive variables are ones that do not scale with \\'size\\', extensive do scale with size. E.g., in PV, P is intensive, V is extensive. Other couples are TS, \\\\mu N, \\\\gamma A,  P E (polarization/electric field), MH (magnetization, magnetic field), \\\\sigma \\\\epsilon (stress strain). There are a lot of variables, and apply to a variety of situations. \\n When transforming the internal energy, we make sure that the \\'handles\\' (the things that a free to change in our system) are in the derivative (TdS has entropy in the derivative). In internal energy, all the handles are on the extensive quantities. So: \\n U = TS - PV \\n dU = TdS - PdV \\n When you transform, you add or subtract the derivatives of those terms to get to the handles of your system. For example, in Gibbs Free Energy, temperature and pressure are your handles. So: \\n G=U-TS+PV \\n dG = dU - TdS -SdT + PdV + VdP \\n  = TdS - PdV - TdS - SdT + PdV + VdP \\n\\n = -SdT + PdV\\n \\n Now that you know dG = -SdT + PdV, you can subtract the G from two different states *sharing the same boundaries (in the dV/dT term) and you get: \\n G1= -S1 dT + P1 dV \\n G2 = -S2 dT + P2 dV \\n DeltaG = (S1-S2) dT + (P2-P1)dV \\n Then if you set the T or V as a constant you\\'ll get the Gibbs Free Energy. It looks funny because there\\'s no DeltaH, but it\\'s quite trivial to prove that DeltaH = (P2-P1)dV. Exercise left to the reader? Extra Credit to whoever solves it in the comments. Start by legendre transforming the internal energy with the handles of pressure and entropy. You can also do Helmholtz free energy, which is temperature and volume as the handles, which is often more important in constrained material systems (like grain growth and whatnot). \\n \\n So now that you\\'ve transformed your internal energy to have the correct degrees of freedom corresponding to the boundaries of your system, you can now calculate how the system will  freely change  in order to reach equilibrium. \\n Gibbs Free Energy is the most prevalent one you learn because the handles are temperature and pressure, which are the easiest to control in a typical chemical environment. It is always important to use the appropriate free energy expression for your system, or else you\\'ll get nonsensical results. Like I wrote earlier, Enthalpy is similar to Gibbs Free Energy except that the handles are pressure  and entropy. That\\'s why it\\'s different than Gibbs Free Energy. Enthalpies are nice to document because they are temperature independent and so they\\'re more valuable to write down than, say, tables of Gibbs Free Energies for each system!', \"Inspired by the comments in [this thread]( \\n For the newbies, there is no true 'tank' role in Dota 2, and a team can be completely successful without any naturally high-HP hero. \\n That being said, everyone has experienced a 'tanky hero' on the opposite team.

First Nations people on the East Coast had a drink called the [\\'Black Drink\\']( while not alcoholic, it certainly was a powerful narcotic. \\nThere are many other [examples]( \\n These drinks were not distiled however, meaning that they had less bang for their buck. But that\\'s not the issue. \\n The issue is that substance abuse, in ALL forms, is directly correlated with poverty, poor living conditions, a lack of family structure, etc., etc. Basically everything that comes from being Indigenous people under Western Colonialism. The history of colonialism, with residential schools, forced education, disease, and general not-being-nice, resulted in living conditions that are ripe for substance abuse. It doesn\\'t matter what the substance is, its the symptom, not the cause. \\n Have you ever read about the  Rat Park  don\\'t get addicted to drugs. I believe it\\'s kind of the same thing. Life for post-colonial Indigenous groups has not been very happy. It\\'s not surprising that some of them seek escapism. \\n So, the', \"I hope I'm not too late to the party but I feel like there needs to be a few things cleared up here. \\n First, anthropologists already know that pre-hominid  homo  species made tools.  Homo habilis  was named the 'handy man'. [Check the wiki link]( \\n Seriously guys, this is anthro 100. After Habilis' came and went, there were still more stone tools. Check out some of the [Acheulean technology]( Those things lasted from 1.7 million to about 100,000 years ago. \\n So why is this article interesting? \\n The title is misleading (not that OP meant to, of course)- the skills the researchers are talking about are about  projectile tools . There has long been a debate about when hominid species learned to tie pointy rocks to sticks and throw them. This is some seriously, ridiculously old evidence of hominids doing just that. \\n It could be that archaic homo sapiens were making them, though that pushes the time frame back about 80,000 years, like the title says- that would be cool. Or maybe it was another Homo species-  Erectus  was kicking around back then, and Neanderthals were in Europe somewhat close to this time period, presumably stabbing things and eating them.... hell, there is even some [evidence]( suggesting that  heidelbergensis  was using spears, and those guys are like 500,000 years old. \\n Also, the dating on this was stratigraphic, not direct- [check out the actual article, its free]( and while useful, this isn't exact direct dating. The youngest layer was still 180,000 years old... and these things were found well below that. So I'm guessing they're pretty damn old. It's cool, because until now we've only had evidence of pre-humans using thrusting spears, not throwing spears. Throwing your weapon, rather then thrusting is a huge step forward in the quest to kill things easily without getting gorged by some angry, hurt wild animal. \\n Basically, the\", \"Well good Redditor, it's a great question. I think you've inspired me to write about it in an upcoming blog post. I'll post the link when I'm done, but off the top of my head: \\n People like feeling like they are part of something bigger than themselves. This feeling can be inspirational. Virantiquus had incredibly good points about social change and illumination from the past and I can speak to this from an experiential level. \\nI am currently working on a small research project as a follow up to a rather large excavation I was part of. Rather than focusing on the data from the artifacts, my partner and I are focusing on the community wide benefits that archaeology has brought. \\nWithout going in to too much detail, the responses we have got from collaborating with local First Nations have been amazing. There is a tangible connection to the past, and a feeling that some connection to a larger part of their heritage is available to them. \\n Athardude mentioned the ability for archaeology to inform modern sustainability and resource use-- this is huge where I work. Shell middens on the West Coast provided a length and depth of data on fish populations, run times, seasonality, and sustainability that otherwise wouldn't be available. \\n Archaeology has the ability to inform us about the complexities of our lives. When someone simplifies an historical narrative in an attempt to justify a current ambition or goal (either good or bad), we can provide the context to those who want to listen with a larger more complete picture, and hopefully an understanding that things are, and have always been, more complicated that they first seem. \\n And finally I offer a simpler, less tangible--but just as valid--rationale: Archaeology helps us paint a bigger, more complete picture of the world we live in. Not for any particular goal- just because its cool to understand things. I love physics and biology--not because of what they have produced FOR me, but because of the wonder and amazement they have produced IN me. We don't need to take pictures of far away galaxies-- but we should-- because it helps us understand the bigger picture. Just like physicist looking out into space, we look back in time to understand our universe. As  HaveAMap pointed out: this stuff is just plain cool. \\n I have walked my mom around one of the largest village sites in Ontario, shown her 40m wide pithouses in British Columbia, let her pick up and hold 5000 year old knives from shell middens, had her place her thumb in the preserved thumb print of a 600 year old potter.The connection she felt to other people, to the whole of humanity, made all the ours of artifact washing and data gathering worth it. I have shown young children how their ancestors made tools and fished, spoke to Elders about the stories their ancestors bones can tell, and I have learned throughout it all a little bit more about what it means to be a human in this world. I am incredibly privileged that I live in a world that supports these kind of experiences, and I see it as our responsibility to share this with as many people as we possibly can. Being human is awesome. We do ridiculously amazing stuff. We should all feel proud that we're part of something as cool as being human. And archaeology can help us feel that way. \\n I'm sorry. I got a little cheesy there at the end.\", 'Hold on there Cowboy. You\\'re all over the place. Let\\'s see what we can do here. \\n First, are we talking about City-states, Chiefdoms, or Empires? The first part of your questions seems to want to talk about Civilizations, like Mesopotamia, Egypt, Mesoamerica, etc.  But the second part seems to want to focus on when humans first started living a sedentary life-style. These are two incredibly different things. \\n Let\\'s clear up the second part first. \\nYou section about \"when we started having permanent residences\" is a giant question in archaeology. We don\\'t know everything about it, but we do know it doesn\\'t happen in \"a few generations\". \\n The movement from a nomadic lifestyle to one of permanent, multi-year long settlements is not a quick one. Frank and Bill don\\'t decide one day to stay put and start making babies with Marge and Roma.\\n In a very ( very, very, very ) generalized sense, this change happens over a couple of thousand years. In some cases, this transition may go faster (say a couple of hundred years) but in both cases the combination of environmental stability (i.e. food sources), demographics (i.e. population size), and social factors (i.e. social organization) have to come together in a certain way that either forces or allows people to stay put. \\n Just how much one of these factors is responsible for people starting to stay where they are is a source of thousands of research articles, books, dissertations, etc. We know that it takes a certain coming together of these factors- but we don\\'t know exactly how they need to come together. \\n Still with me? Good. Moving on to warfare. \\n As people start to settle down, they don\\'t need as huge an area around them to occupy. Nomadic groups, with seasonal camps, require a much large area to play in-- but as you settle down (and start living off more predictable and renewable foods), you don\\'t have to move as far. \\n If a bunch of groups do this-- and they tend to as local conditions allow-- they start forming territories. When one of these territories pump into another, then conflict starts. Warfare is one way of resolving these conflicts-- and not always the default. \\n Again- I\\'m being incredibly simplistic here-- this story plays out differently every time it\\'s reenacted-- but I\\'m giving you the abstract. \\n The thing is, these sedentary villages- they haven\\'t reached Civilization levels yet. Hell, mostly they\\'re not even at Chiefdoms by the time this starts: they have a level of social-political organization we like to call \"transegalitarian\". Because we like big words. \\n If those three factors I mentioned above (environment, demography, and social organization) interact in certain ways, we get chiefdoms. Now this isn\\'t the inevitable outcome of the march of time. It\\'s a specific response to specific factors. I mention this because it\\'s an important fact people often over look. We don\\'t move from Tribes, to Chiefdoms, to Civilizations if we have enough time. We only do it if the situations are ideal for it to happen. Civilizations are not \"more evolved\" or \"more advanced\" then nomadic hunter-gatherers. No more than a sparrow is \"more evolved\" than a mongoose. They are two different things-- the result of separate historical, geographical, and environmental factors. I mention this because when ever I taught about Early Civs, this \\'more advanced\\' nonsense came up and it bugged the crap out of me. \\n Now we can get to your first question, What happen to these people when there social structure \\'fell\\'? \\n In some cases they\\'re taken over by new leadership. The fall of Rome was probably not that noticeable to the average Roman. It happened over a long time, and was really just a switch from one kind of leader to another. Why we call it a \"Fall\" is because during this time Roman influence over the larger world lessened significantly. Which allowed other rulers to take the place of Roman Governors. Though that\\'s how it worked in Rome. \\n In the Maya area, the \"Fall\" also took a couple of hundred years, but the collapse was a movement away from centralized control, to one of more regional control. Mayan leaders didn\\'t quite disappear, they just had more local control, and less regional power. Which translate into less wealth. In the Mayan case, it was likely a combination of social factors (they were a little top-heavy towards the end) and environmental factors (it\\'s hard to be the king when your people are not growing enough food) \\n One more time ( say it with me people! )-- this is not the full answer! Simplifying the causes of a collapse into generalities means that you\\'re missing the real complexity of the situation. Like saying America went to war with Iraq for oil. You, me, and most other people know that\\'s not the  whole  truth. But it\\'s a big part of the story. \\n The best way to think about culture change is this: \\n Cultures have a variety of adaptive options, and when they form larger communities you get the multitude of different types of chiefdoms, civilizations, etc. that we see. When they are forced by a variety of factors to change again, they have the same plethora of options. Which is why studying human cultural change on a global level is so damn hard,l and why the answers--even simplified like I did here-- are so damn complicated. And fun.']": "Based on the reddit postings, the user is interested in archaeology, climate change, indigenous cultures, anthropology, human evolution, and the benefits and importance of archaeology.", "[\"So, I bet this is one the internet didn't know: \\n I had seen on here to put red wine, vinegar, and dish soap, which would make them fly in and get stuck.

Saying: \\n >Frontal lobe of humans inhibits our actions even when result can be seen as beneficial. \\n Is not true. The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is involved in impulsivity and response inhibition; however, a big job of the orbitofrontal cortex is to compare the actual outcome with the expected outcome. SO if you carry out some behavior that you are expecting to lead to a large reward, and it actually leads to a small reward or a punishment, the OFC is going to encode that information as a \"non-beneficial response\". \\n The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is the primary portal by which the cortex communicates with the basal ganglia (BG), which is the subcortical structure needed to produce and/or change motor programs (actual behaviors). The PFC --> BG projection can be potentiated by reinforcement, which is a big part of the mechanism by which the operant conditioning mentioned in OP\\'s post works. A behavior is reinforced, PFC --> Nucleus accumbens (part of the BG) synapses become potentiated, that behavior is more likely to be performed in the future. \\n Now, the OFC communicates with the PFC to make these expectation vs actual outcome comparisons, and that is how conditioning and decision making happen.', \"Other people have covered this question pretty well, but I'll touch a bit more on: \\n > Are all the cells free-moving within the tissue \\n Back in my early college days when I was starting to really explore specific interests in neuroscience, this was a huge question for me. A lot of cartoons and other illustrations in textbooks kind of make it look like neurons do just float in space, branching out and sending projections far and wide, with nothing really anchoring them down. As /u/synapticsight mentioned, glial cells have a big role in stabilizing synapses. However, a huge influence that is often overlooked is the Extracellular Matrix (ECM). \\n Some variation of ECM exists in every tissue. Probably the best example is the collagen that holds your skin cells together. In the brain, there are other fibrous proteins (proteoglycans), such as fibronectin, vitronectin, and laminin, that exist in the extracellular space, and can anchor themselves to molecules on the cell surface called Cell Adhesion Receptors. These receptors can then signal from the extracellular space to the intracellular space, particularly to actin-regulating molecules that will control cellular movement (such as the movement required for making a new dendritic spine, or new projection for an axon). \\n [Here is a little cartoon that does include ECM.]( \\n I study a family of proteins called Matrix Metalloproteinases (MMPs). As their name suggests, these are proteinases (enzymes that break down proteins), and they act in the extracellular matrix. In order for synaptic plasticity to occur, MMPs have to degrade the extracellular matrix, to allow the cell to move. Within the past 7 years or so, MMPs have been shown to be required for multiple forms of learning and memory in behaving animals, and also for an important cellular model of learning and memory that electrophysiologists use, called [Long-Term Potentiation]( \\n There is a separate class of proteins called TIMPs, which act to turn off MMPs. So, in order for learning to occur, there is a cascade that looks like this:\", 'Vyvanse is considered a pro-drug of adderall (Pro- indicates it is like a precursor). Adderall is D-Amphetamine. Vyvance is lis-D-Amphetamine, which means it is D-Amphetamine with a Lysine attached (Lysine is an amino acid). If you snort adderall, it is soluble in the mucous membrane and will get into your blood stream very quickly, and reach your brain very quickly. The Lysine attached to Vyvanse makes it less soluble through your mucous membrane. Vyvanse needs to be metabolized by the gut and liver/hepatic system, removing the Lysine, and turning it into regular old adderall. Then it can go to the brain.', \"When I started my PhD I heard terrifying statistics about how only 15-20% of people who start PhD programs ever actually land a tenure-track job in academia. Now I'm 15 months away from graduation, and I'm optimistic for my future. I don't know anyone who has graduated from my school unable to find a post-doc. The ones who did good work while they were here all landed really awesome post-docs. Two senior post-docs in my lab have gotten tenure-track faculty positions at large research universities in the past 2 years. \\n Grad school also breaks a lot of people. I would say almost 50% of people who go into grad school saying that they want to be a PI at a big research institute, have changed their mind by year 4. A lot of people can't handle the pressure of having to constantly write grants to get your own funding, or just don't want that life. So, these people find jobs either as staff scientists, or at liberal arts schools where the primary focus is teaching, and still having some money to do a little bit of interesting research.

It is beneficial to us to become aroused in response to potentially threatening stimuli in our environment. When it shifts from stress to 'anxiety' in my opinion - or at least when that anxiety becomes a disorder - is when there is a chronic stress response, often with little or no provocation. Prolonged activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA axis) causes disruptions of cortisol systems. I can't remember all of the exact specifics, but I know some. Chronically increased glucocorticoids (cortisol in humans) leads to downregulation of glucocorticuoid receptors (GRs) in the hippocampus. The hippocampus is usually involved in a negative feedback loop which shuts of the stress/cort response once it detects elevated cort. So, lack of negative feedback causes even further elevated cort. \\n Chronically elevated cort levels are associated with: \\n \\n Hippocampal dendritic atrophy. The hippocampus is required for learning and memory, so these can start to worsen.  \\n Amygdalar dendritic hypertrophy. The amydala is associated with anxiety and fear responses, but also reward responses. Typically, the behavioral phenotype seen is increased anxiety or fear. \\n Reversible prefrontal cortical dendritic atrophy. The PFC is involved in executive function, planning, working memory, decision making, etc. These abilities can be diminished in people with chronically elevated cort.\", 'It\\'s called  PubMed Central .

PSYCHIATRIC DIAGNOSIS IS BASED SOLELY ON OPINION. \\n That\\'s fine, mental disorders are based on the medical  model , not the idea that they are brain diseases. That is, it utilises the classification system and the use of symptoms as indicators, and this is the only link between mental disorders and physical diseases. \\n The shift away from thinking of mental disorders as physical diseases occurred nearly half a century ago, and with it followed the terminology shift from \"mental illness\" to \"mental disorder\". This of course doesn\\'t mean that no mental disorder is caused by a brain disease or physical \"malfunction\", or that biology plays no role in mental disorders, just that very few mental disorders are a direct result of a brain disease (e.g. syphilis). \\n The author is wrong to suggest that there are no tests for mental disorders though - there are behavioral tests. The measures here are \"subjective\" in the sense that they are measured against how people usually score in similar situations, but this is no different from a blood test where the results are gauged according to an average range. \\n >2) YES, PEOPLE CAN GET DEPRESSED, SAD, ANXIOUS AND EVEN ACT PSYCHOTIC.  THAT DOESN\u2019T MAKE THEM  MENTALLY \u201cDISEASED\u201d \\n Technically it does. A mental disorder is something which falls into the \"three D\\'s\": deviant, dysfunctional, and distressing. If a behavior is more extreme than what is usual, and significantly affects a person\\'s ability to function in their lives, and causes them to suffer, then it is a mental disorder. \\n People usually make this claim because they believe that mental disorders are just extreme forms of \"normal\" behaviors, so they shouldn\\'t be labelled as mental disorders. But psychologists reply that they are labelled mental disorders precisely because they are extreme forms of \"normal\" behaviors. We all hear voices, we all have difficulties focusing sometimes, or have moments of obsessive-compulsive thoughts and behaviors, but the reason why we don\\'t all get labelled as having schizophrenia, ADHD or OCD is because these instances are usually rare and have no real impact on our happiness or lives. Sometimes I\\'ll worry that I haven\\'t locked my front door and have to walk back up my road to check - the extent of my \"problem\" is the loss of 5 minutes. Someone who will get diagnosed with OCD will continually have to go back to check that their door is locked, to the point where the sun goes down, they\\'ve missed out on the activity they left their house to go do, and they realise they\\'ve gone hours without food and water. \\n Whether their behavior is \"normal\" in some sense, or even if it\\'s an evolutionary advantage according to some unfalsifiable evo psych theory, it makes no difference as the person still needs help. If people don\\'t want to call them \"mental disorders\" then they can pick a new name. The concept is always going to be the same: \"A thought or behavioral pattern that disrupts someone\\'s life so much that they need help\". \\n >3) THE CAMPAIGN TO \u201cSTOP THE STIGMA OF MENTAL ILLNESS\u201d IS BROUGHT TO YOU BY\u2026 BIG PHARMA \\n When you define \"Big Pharma\" as \"anyone in the mental health field\" then of course you\\'re going to find that \"Big Pharma\" is pushing the campaign because mental health issues aren\\'t that important to people not in the mental health field. \\n However, the claim is especially wrong because campaigns like \"stop the stigma\" are also heavily supported, and run by, psychologists (who have also added a lot of data and research on the topic). The reason why this makes the claim wrong is that psychologists cannot prescribe drugs, so they have no connection to Big Pharma. \\n >4) PSYCHIATRIC \u201cLABELS\u201d ARE THE PROBLEM \\n To some degree, yes, labels can add to the problems associated with mental disorder. But at the end of the day, if someone is tearing the skin off the shoulder because they believe flesh eating bugs have burrowed under their skin, giving them a label is probably the least of their worries. \\n >Increasing numbers of people  realize that just because a child fidgets, or loses pencils or toys\u2014criteria for an \u201cADHD\u201d diagnoses, this doesn\u2019t mean a child is mentally ill. \\n Classic misrepresentation of mental disorders.

People come to psychologists saying, \"I need help, here are the problems I\\'m having in my life\". Psychologists have made a note of commonalities between problems, and given reoccurring groups of problems a category label. This is because it makes it easier to say a person is suffering from \"Disorder X\", rather than saying they are suffering from, \"Symptoms A, B, D, G, H, X, and Y\". \\n They don\\'t need to \"add\" the term \\'disorder\\' to the end of it because it\\'s already implied by the fact that the people have come in asking for help.

The mental health field recognises a number of effective non-drug treatments for a range of mental disorders; for example, the main treatments for depression, anxiety, autism and phobias are primarily are non-drug therapies (although some drugs can be used in combination for more effective results). \\n If Big Pharma were behind the DSM, and people were tricked into believing they had mental disorders in order to promote and sell drugs, then why is such a lucrative field like autism relatively untouched? Why would they hand over such an easy market (given that Big Pharma apparently doesn\\'t need to make drugs that actually work) to behavioral therapists? And why would behavioral therapists bother spending 40+hours a week with kids doing extensive training, if they could just work with Big Pharma to sell off snake oil? \\n >The larger problem is that the biological drug model (based on the bogus mental disorders are a disease marketing campaign) prevents governments from funding real medical solutions for people experiencing difficulty. \\n This quote contained a link, but I couldn\\'t bring myself to insert it here. The author is strongly against Big Pharma. Against evil corporations attempting to steal your money by lying to you and promoting treatments that don\\'t really work. So their alternative is to link you to a number of alt med sites, that sell things like homeopathic pills to cure your autism. But this is okay of course because, as we know, the alt med industry is just the little guy, it hardly makes any money. That\\'s why they can\\'t perform any research to demonstrate the effectiveness of their products, and Big Medicine is keeping them down by not testing their products for them. Except for when they do, but of course then they fake negative results to suppress real treatments, because a money hungry evil corporation like Big Pharma would hate to find an effective treatment or cure for multiple diseases and disorders, that costs nearly nothing to make and has a huge profit margin... \\n There are problems and side-effects associated with medication. Sometimes, for some people, medication brings about more problems than it solves and here we need to look for non-drug alternatives for them. But we don\\'t need to turn to bullshit like reiki, or homeopathy, or whatever. We can turn to things like cognitive behavioral therapy, or systematic desensitisation, or applied behavioral therapy.

Even if the difference was .0001%, an adequately designed experiment would be able to confidently conclude that it\\'s a true effect. Given that the results were statistically significant, it can safely be assumed that it falls outside a margin of error. \\n >As a side note, I didn\\'t see anything written about how many kids in the study were boys and how many were girls, but I was making the assumption that it was 50/50.

Wilkinson and Peter W.R. Woodruff, \"Male and female voices activate distinct regions in the male brain\", In Press, NeuroImage. I\\'m deeply puzzled by some of the research that paper describes -- if Sokhi et al. really did what they seem to be saying they did, I don\\'t see how the results can be interpreted at all -- but I\\'m pretty sure that the experiment doesn\\'t mean most of the things that people are saying it does. Maybe it doesn\\'t mean any of them. \\n >... \\n >Thus when they say (in their press release) that \"when a man hears a female voice\" such-and-such a region of his brain is activated, what they mean is that the specified region is (among the regions where) the two conditions specified in (i) are met: first, \\'female gender-apparent\\' recordings create significantly more activation than  \\'male gender-apparent\\' recordings, and second, \\'female gender-ambiguous\\' recordings yield significantly greater activation than  \\'male gender-ambiguous\\' recordings. \\n >But there are some other descriptions you could give of that set of conditions. For example, you could say that these are the brain regions that respond more to higher-pitched speech than to lower-pitched speech; and for speech in a medium pitch range, respond more to recordings that have been slowed down to reach that level than to recordings that have been speeded up to reach that level. Or perhaps, respond more to phrases that are longer in duration than to phrases that are shorter in duration. This last is not a trivial issue, especially since the subjects were listening to the stimuli against the background of scanner noise, which is roughly like being in a boiler factory inside one of the boilers. (It\\'s possible to arrange the scanning acquisition so that audio stimuli are played in silent intervals, but that was not done in this experiment). So higher-pitch or longer-duration stimuli will probably be more acoustically salient, especially in this very noisy environment, and therefore might show increased auditory activation, quite apart from any sexuality judgments. And lower-pitch or shorter-duration stimuli will be harder to hear, and therefore might engage some additional attention-focusing mechansisms, again apart from any sexuality judgments. \\n >... \\n >So as I said, I\\'m really puzzled about how to think about what these results mean. Whatever is going on, though, there\\'s nothing in their results to stand behind statements like \"[t]he female voice is actually more complex than the male voice, due to differences in the size and shape of the vocal cords and larynx between women and men\", as the Sheffield press release asserts. \\n >And the same press release says that \"when a man hears a female voice the auditory section of his brain is activated, which analyses the different sounds in order to \\'read\\' the voice and determine the auditory face\" -- are we supposed to conclude that males hears male voices in a way that by-passes the auditory cortex? Well, they go on to say that \"[w]hen men hear a male voice the part of the brain that processes the information is towards the back of the brain and is colloquially known as the \\'mind\\'s eye\\'. This is the part of the brain where people compare their experiences to themselves, so the man is comparing his own voice to the new voice to determine gender.\" \\n And here: [GENDER MYTHS: LETTING SCIENCE MISLEAD](', 'You could try training \"creativity\" or novel behaviors, as demonstrated by Pryor  here . \\n It\\'s possible that he may have experienced a kind of  learned helplessness , meaning that there is no incentive for him to want to try to do different things. The best way to overcome learned helplessness is to teach him skills that show him that other behaviors are possible in given situations, and that they can be fun and pleasurable for him. \\n This approach is basically just what I\\'ve described above by teaching him to bark at the TV. For my dog, I like to get him excited when someone knocks at the dog or rings the doorbell, so I get someone to knock at the door and I jump up and say something like, \"Who\\'s that?!\", then run to the front door, getting him to chase/follow me. I then lavish him with praise, cuddles, treats etc. I now have an incredibly placid dog that almost never makes a noise, except for when the doorbell goes and he runs down there and barks his head off. I then let people in and he sits quietly to be patted and then trots off. \\n Just be patient, and be realistic in what the end result will be - i.e. don\\'t expect to end up with a wacky dog that acts spontaneously all the time. Enjoy small successes and treat them as if your dog has just won gold in an Olympic event.', 'I\\'m not sure what the \"challenge\" is supposed to be, as both defending or failing to defend either of those positions has absolutely no bearing on whether religious thinking is reasonable or correct. \\n 1)  Think of a question which has/had a scientific answer, where a religious one was better:  Why would we expect religion to have answers about the natural world? Some specific religions, and religious people, have attempted to speculate on such questions, but religion as a whole and science answer distinctly different questions. The entire basis of the question rests on the myth of the science-religion conflict. \\n We could equally do the same thing to science, and propose: \"Think of a question which has/had a mathematical answer, where a scientific one was better\". It makes no sense to judge the validity and worth of a field by comparing it to the standards of a completely different area. Most religions aim to discuss and provide answers to the \"meaning\" and \"purpose\" of life, to explain how you should live your life to get through the pearly gates or hump your 72 virgins. Science obviously has nothing to say on such matters, so religion could still (theoretically) be relevant, useful and important, even if it can\\'t propose a better model for quantum mechanics. \\n The author makes the challenge even more ridiculous by explicitly ruling out any knowledge through forms like revelation or divine dictation, which probably boils down to the idea that he wants a form of knowledge accepted by science - making the whole challenge a little circular. It also assumes that science is a valid method for uncovering truth, which requires a number of assumptions and supporting arguments but isn\\'t too unreasonable, however, the problem is that not everybody needs to assume such a thing. \\n That is, if a religious person accepts that science is the best method for uncovering the natural world, and accepts that science is founded upon methodological naturalism, then there is absolutely no conflict between the idea (for example) that human bodies cannot come back from the dead, and accepting that Jesus was resurrected. This is just because science has no tool or way of investigating miracles or supernatural events. \\n So, like Galileo, a religious person can accept that scientific knowledge is the best way to \"discover\" god, as the natural world is presumably his work (hung up on his mother\\'s fridge somewhere). \\n 2)  Name one moral or ethical action or behavior committed or carried out by a believer that could not have been committed or carried out by an atheist:  This is a valid rebuttal of the claim that religions have exclusive rights over morality, but it does nothing to answer the question of whether religious ideas should have a \"foothold\" in the realm of morality. If an ethicist could demonstrate that religious views of morality were more consistent, produced better outcomes, or performed the best on some metric, then that would give credence to the idea that religious morality is valuable. Whether anyone could  actually do that  is the problem for religious ideas, not the claim that religion has a monopoly on morality. \\n Interestingly, with the morality issue, we can demonstrate why the first question is misleading and dishonest. If we change the first question to:  \"Think of a question where a religious one was better than a scientific one\" , and eliminate the requirement that religion needs to be better than science at science, we find that morality is one area where it is better able to provide an answer. That is, on the question of whether we should or should not kill someone, science has absolutely no say on the matter but religion can make some arguments against it. \\n This isn\\'t to say that \"science has failed\", because \\'ought\\' claims aren\\'t a part of the naturalistic questions it is limited to answering, and it doesn\\'t even mean that the religious arguments supporting one course of action are \"correct\", just that it has the foundation capable of developing reasons against things like murder.', 'It\\'s not that they use different methods, it\\'s that one relies on evidence and verification and the other doesn\\'t. That\\'s the conflict. \\n Not quite, they both rely on evidence and verification but since they deal with different subject matter, they use different kinds and standards of evidence. \\n >It doesn\\'t matter if they\\'re concerned with the same questions or not. That  would  matter if you were talking about whether religion conflicts with scientific facts (such as evolution), but that\\'s not what I mean when I say there\\'s a conflict between science and religion. Science is bigger than just the accumulation of scientific facts; \"science\" is the process, the method of inquiry. \\n It does matter because otherwise the claim would be that science conflicts with everything, since everything non-science uses different types of evidence and levels of verification. \\n >I\\'ll try to explain what I see is the key difference between science and religion: \\n >Suppose you\\'ve got a group of scientists trying to come up with an explanation for why some phenomena occurs, and suppose you\\'ve also got a group of theologians trying to answer some theological question. \\n >Now further suppose that several of the scientists come up with competing hypotheses, and several of the theologians likewise come up with contradictory, mutually exclusive answers \\n >How each group proceeds from that point is the fundamental difference between science and religion. \\n >Science takes the competing hypotheses, puts them to the test, and allows us to discover which ones were wrong. Religion can\\'t do that. The theologians simply have to agree to disagree. \\n >']": "Based on the reddit postings, it appears that the user is primarily interested in the field of mental health and psychology.

I assume the thermos is a lost cause - sitting for 3 years filled with coffee likely ruined it forever, so I get ready to toss it in the garbage. \\n But wait, another officemate says as he opens the thermos, the coffee inside isn\\'t even moldy. We begin to look nervously at each other, because we all know what\\'s about to happen. Finally, one of them blurts out, \"I\\'ll drink it for a dollar.\" As if out of thin air, a dollar is immediately produced, and the bet has commenced. \\n We watch as he slowly raises the thermos to his lips, unsure whether to laugh or cry. Several swallows later, he sets the thermos down, only to declare its flavor profile as \"kind of grainy, but not too bad\".', 'You\\'ve actually asked two separate questions here, and the answers are probably mutually exclusive: \\n 1) Where on Earth has the least light pollution? \\n 2) Where on Earth could one see the most stars with the naked eye? \\n For the first question, \"the middle of the Pacific\" is as good an answer as any. There are many locations in the ocean where all light domes from civilization are located well below the horizon, due to the Earth\\'s curvature. \\n However , your second question is actually much more complex - observing stars from these oceanic locations has two difficulties. First, you\\'re at sea level, which means extra atmosphere above you to scatter starlight. Second, there tends to be a lot of water vapor in the atmosphere over the ocean. That causes further scattering, reducing the transparency of the skies quite a bit. \\n So, to observe more stars, you want to be at elevation in order to be above a substantial fraction of the atmosphere...but not too high. Above about 10,000 feet, you start to become oxygen-deprived, and your eyes can no longer dilate as large as they can below that elevation, thus reducing the number of stars that are visible. \\n I\\'ve experienced this first-hand while observing on Mauna Kea - you can see more stars at base camp around 9,000 feet than you can at the top of the mountain near all the telescopes, almost 14,000 feet. It\\'s as though your eyes just can\\'t quite get dark-adapted - though you can suddenly see many more stars if you use an external oxygen tank (but that\\'s basically cheating for the purpose of this question). \\n To reduce atmospheric water vapor, you really want to be in a desert region. Atmospheric transparency, often measured in terms of the distance to the visible objects on the horizon, can be greater than 100 miles in the desert (as opposed to a limit of about 10 miles in much more humid locations). This is a large reason why astronomers tend to build big telescopes in deserts - it\\'s not just a greater number of clear nights. \\n So to see the most stars, we\\'re looking for regions that are very far from civilization (to reduce light pollution), in the desert, and near 10,000 feet elevation. I\\'m going to go out on a limb here, and say that the Tibesti mountain range in northern Chad (in the middle of the Sahara desert) is probably your best bet - it has a couple peaks higher than 10,000 feet. The Atacama desert in Chile is also a good candidate here, but there are cities not too far away.', \"Very good question - nitrogen is an interesting case. You list the main volcanic gases, but volcanoes do emit some nitrogen, often as [nitric oxides]( not a whole lot. \\n However, molecular nitrogen, N2, is a unique constituent. It has a greater [bond-dissociation energy]( than almost any other molecule. This means only the most extreme ultraviolet photons have enough energy to break apart molecular nitrogen into two nitrogen atoms, and photons that energetic are relatively rare. \\n This is important because a molecule of nitrogen gas, N2, is twice as heavy as an atom of nitrogen. It's much easier for lighter atmospheric constituents to escape into space than heavier constituents. So, nitrogen's escape rates are much lower than other gases since it generally stays in its molecular state. \\n The strong N2 bond also means it's very difficult for nitrogen atoms to get absorbed into other compounds, so there's not a lot of atmosphere-surface chemistry the way there is with, say, molecular oxygen. I'm not a biologist, so you might know more about this, but I believe a lot of biology involves creative ways to fix nitrogen. \\n So, between decreased escape rates, and low chemical interaction rates, nitrogen needs significantly less replenishment to maintain constant levels. If volcanoes on Earth did turn off, we'd still eventually lose our nitrogen, but at a significantly slower rate than other gases.\", 'First we need to understand the current structure of Jupiter. \\n At the top we have the atmosphere, made mostly of cold hydrogen gas. As we dive deeper, the pressure and temperature starts rising. Eventually once hot and dense enough we hit a layer where hydrogen has transitioned to a \"supercritical fluid\", a state that shares properties with both solids and gases. Going even deeper, the pressures increase further so that hydrogen is forced into a solid state, in spite of warm temperatures. \\n Somewhere around ~30% of the way down, the pressure is so great the electrons from hydrogen atoms are forced into higher and higher energy states so as not to violate the Pauli Exclusion Principle. Electrons can start moving freely, conducting between atoms, and so the hydrogen becomes metallic. At the temperatures we expect at these depths, it is in a liquid metallic state. \\n Finally, deep, deep down, there is some kind of solid core of rock and ice, although exactly how large it is remains a subject of vigorous debate. Hopefully we\\'ll know more about this puzzle when the Juno spacecraft arrives at Jupiter in 2016 and starts probing the deep interior. \\n Now, as for the cooling bit: it turns out to be quite difficult for metallic hydrogen to cool, as electrons must drop down to lower energy states...but it\\'s at such high pressure that most of those states are all already occupied. It can still happen by conducting/diffusing heat into non-metallic layers, but that\\'s an incredible slow process, very similar to white dwarf stars cooling into \"black dwarfs\" after considerable time. \\n Over many billions of years, the liquid metallic interior, will likely cool enough to become a solid metallic interior. This isn\\'t quite certain, as the phase diagram for hydrogen at such extreme pressures is not well known - it may be that metallic hydrogen can remain a liquid even at low temperatures for a specific range of high pressures. \\n Once most of this heat has escaped to space, the overlying gaseous atmosphere will eventually collapse, becoming a solid ice. This process may be somewhat similar to how part of Mars\\' CO2 atmosphere collapses into CO2 ice caps during each winter.', \"Wow, this was the exact same question I was asked on my graduate school orals. What follows is a bit technical, but this is really just a function of the planet's gravity and temperature, as well as the escape velocity of molecular hydrogen gas, the prime constituent of any proto-stellar nebula. \\n Hydrogen molecules have much less mass than, say, oxygen molecules...which in turn means that at a given temperature, hydrogen molecules are moving that much faster. We can get at some values for this by looking at the Maxwell-Boltzmann velocity distribution, where the most probable velocity is v = sqrt(2kT/m) and the standard deviation of velocity is v = sqrt(3kT/m). \\n For example, on Earth with a temperature of ~300K, the average velocity of an hydrogen molecule will be: \\n v avg  = sqrt( ^2kT /  m  ) = sqrt ( ^2 (1.38e-23 ^J/K) (300 ^K) /  (3.35e-27 kg)  ) = 1572 m/s \\n That's still a long way from Earth's escape velocity, but remember that this is just the most probable velocity for a hydrogen molecule...there's a whole distribution of molecules moving at different velocities. The standard deviation of that velocity distribution will be: \\n v stddev  = sqrt( ^3 /  2  )   v avg * = 1925 m/s \\n So, when you consider that Earth's escape velocity is 11,200 m/s, that means any molecules that are moving 5 standard deviations over the the most probable speed will escape the planet for good. Admittedly, that's not many escaping at any given time...only about 1 in 650 billion are moving fast enough at any one instant (assuming it's a gaussian distribution, which it's not exactly). However, as those fastest molecules leave, the velocity distribution sorts itself out again, promoting new hydrogen molecules to those speeds, which then leave the planet, etc. Eventually the entire mass of molecular hydrogen will evaporate off the planet as the fastest few molecules are repeatedly culled from the distribution. \\n It's much more difficult for something like oxygen do this. With a molecular mass 16 times greater, it's average velocity and standard deviation will be 4 times less: v avg  = 393 m/s, and v stddev  = 481 m/s \\n That works out such that oxygen molecules with velocities only about 22.5 standard deviations above the most probable value have escape velocity. I'm actually having trouble finding any calculator that can figure out how few molecules this is, since it's so incredibly few (if you can find one that can do erf() functions on large numbers, let me know). The point is here that the number of oxygen molecules leaving is few enough that it's easily replenished by the combined action of volcanism and photosynthesis. \\n Now, let's consider hydrogen gas on Jupiter. Since Jupiter is only about half the absolute temperature of Earth, hydrogen molecules are are only moving about 70% as fast as they are here on Earth. More importantly, though, Jupiter's escape velocity is almost 6 times higher than Earth's. This works out such that hydrogen molecules on Jupiter must be moving 42 standard deviations about the most probable value to escape...again, not significant over the lifetime of the planet, and so Jupiter holds on to its hydrogen.\", \"So what the sketchy science websites ignore is the feedback loop between temperature and CO2 concentration. Yes, it's true that in most warming periods (but not all) CO2 lags temperature by several hundred years - but all that tells you is that CO2 did not start that specific warming event. Increasing CO2 concentration causes rising temperatures, but rising temperatures also cause increasing CO2 concentration. \\n From what we understand about climate, this actually makes sense. Rising temperatures increase the weathering rate of rocks, which releases more CO2 into the atmosphere. In turn, the increased CO2 concentration raises the temperature further via the greenhouse effect. Thus, there is a positive feedback loop until a new equilibrium temperature is reached. \\n For the eras that we have the time resolution to distinguish CO2 concentration versus temperature, most of the warming events were started by orbital variations known as [Milankovitch cycles]( resulting in greater amounts sunlight being absorbed by Earth. Since this is an external cause for the warming, one would not expect the CO2 concentration to play a role in the warming event until increased weathering had kicked in - thus the centuries of lag. \\n One of the (many) fallacies that said sketchy websites make is that of [Single Cause]( - namely that because CO2 wasn't the initial driver of most prior warming events, it can't be for current or future warming events. In fact, there's fairly good evidence that the [Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum]( was caused by a sudden release of greenhouse gas in the Arctic Ocean when several millions of tons of methane clathrates melted. Temperatures very quickly rose after that.\"]": "Based on the summary of the reddit postings, the user appears to be interested in the following areas:\n1.

If you\\'re familiar with the dot product, you know that any orthogonal vectors have a vanishing dot product. More generally, we can define [inner products]( on spaces, and then  define  orthogonality to mean that the inner product vanishes. \\n This definition of orthogonality is neat because it allows you to express vectors in orthogonal bases with ease: each component is just the inner product of the vector with the unit vector corresponding to that component. For example, with the dot product, you can find the  x -coordinate of any vector by dotting it with (1,0,0), which is the unit vector corresponding to the  x -component. \\n Let\\'s formalize. In general, if  e^i  is the  i th unit vector, and  v  is some vector in the space, then  i th component of  v  is given by \\n v^i  = ( e^i ,  v ) \\n where ( a , b ) is the inner product of  a  and  b . This only works if all of the  e^i  are mutually orthogonal; we can talk about why if you like. \\n This more abstract statement is applicable to much more than just the dot product. For instance, you might be familiar with Fourier series, where you can break up any function into a sum of sines and cosines. This seems like a crazy idea at first, but what makes it all tick is an inner product on the space of functions, together with the fact that the sines and cosines form a basis in that space. Under this inner product, all of the sines and cosines are mutually orthogonal, so to find the coefficient for each term in the series, all you have to do is to take the inner product of your \"vector\" (function) with each of the sine and cosine functions. That\\'s what a Fourier series / transform actually  is \u2014rewriting a function in the basis of sines and cosines using the inner product to find the components.', 'Hi there! It looks like you\\'re interested and excited, which is always great. Let me give you a brief picture of what astronomy looks like as a career. \\n \\n To be an astronomer, you would generally be working for a university or a government lab. The kind of work you might actually do could range from designing new telescopes to find exoplanets to creating theoretical models of large-scale structure in the universe. Whatever the specific focus, you would be performing original research and doing a lot of creative thinking. \\n That said, it\\'s worth knowing this early: the big measure of success is the quality and quantity of the work you can publish, but that isn\\'t all there is to it. Depending on your exact position, you may also spend a great deal of time writing proposals for grant money, and your job security may depend strongly on how much money you can bring in to your institution. If you want to become a professor, which is one of the most comfortable positions in the field, you can also expect to spend time teaching and mentoring graduate students. This means you\\'d be spending less of your time on research, and more of your time directing a small army of students and postdocs to do it for you. \\n It\\'s also worth knowing early that the job market for astronomy research positions is extremely tough. This means it\\'s good to keep track of what skills you have that are marketable elsewhere, and fortunately, most astronomers pick them up along the way. For instance, many astronomers become very skilled with data analysis and interpretation, and then they become \"data scientists\" at big tech companies or on Wall Street. \\n \\n Now let me outline what steps one typically takes to become a professional astronomer. \\n It starts with an undergraduate degree, which is typically (but not necessarily) in physics or astronomy. You need a significant physics background to begin a graduate education in astronomy. \\n Next, you\\'ll need a PhD in physics or astronomy. There\\'s very little you can do, professionally speaking, with anything less. A master\\'s degree can help you find work in industry outside astronomy research, but it\\'s not very useful in the research world. \\n Once you have a PhD, you can apply directly for research positions, or for tenure-track professorships. However, most people need to get some more research experience first, so it\\'s very common to take some time for one or more postdoctoral fellowships. After that, with any luck, you\\'ll be well-connected enough to make a bid for a long-term position. \\n You mentioned a concern about exams. The only exam that could really be said to weed people is the GRE exam that most schools rely on in the graduate admissions process. The exam should be pretty straightforward by the time you finish the undergraduate curriculum. Graduate programs also have qualifying exams: these are big comprehensive tests that come after your first year or two, and passing lets you continue in the program. But these usually aren\\'t meant to weed people out; most schools will let you retake the exam if you fail. \\n I hope that all this leaves you with a sense of how much of a commitment it can take to have a career in astronomy. I don\\'t want to scare you off by any means\u2014if this is what you want to do, and you understand what the field looks like, this might be for you.', \"You've gotten some answers here, but the way that many physicists think about it is as a consequence of geometry. I'll try to explain. \\n One way to characterize a space is by its symmetries. For example, a Euclidean (normal) space is symmetric under rotation and translation. In particular, the length of a vector doesn't change if you rotate or translate your point of view. \\n Now, try to imagine space and time together in one four-dimensional  Euclidean  space. That is, say you just have a plain old  x  axis,  y  axis,  z  axis, and  t  axis. In this space, there's one more symmetry: if you keep uniformly translating your viewpoint as a function of the  t  coordinate, the lengths of vectors in space still remain the same. To give that a physical interpretation: space looks the same to you no matter what speed you move with. \\n But in special relativity, our four-dimensional spacetime  isn't  Euclidean. And while it still has rotational and translational symmetry, it doesn't have the same symmetry under a change of speed\u2014it has a different one. If you change your speed in special relativity,  space  doesn't look the same; instead, there's a combination of space and time that does look the same. In particular, the quantity \\n \u2206 s ^2 = \u2206 t ^2 - \u2206 x ^2 \\n is the same for any observer, where \u2206 x  and \u2206 t  are the distance and time between two events. To be clear, if spacetime were Euclidean, \u2206 x  and \u2206 t  would independently be preserved. \\n What we learn from this is that spacetime doesn't behave in a Euclidean way. Moreover, our formula for \u2206 s  is analogous to the distance between points in spacetime: it's something that's always the same for every observer. So let's take a shift in our perspective, and say: \\n Spacetime is a four-dimensional space where distances are given by \u2206s instead of by the Euclidean distance formula. \\n But to a mathematician, it's easy to say exactly what this space is: it's [Minkowski space]( And thus, the entire content of special relativity can be summed up like this: \\n Spacetime is Minkowskian rather than Euclidean. \\n That's a much more elegant way to look at it, and it gives you everything you expect from special relativity: the privileged status of one speed, time dilation, length contraction, the works. \\n This is an extremely long answer to your question, so let me tie it back to what you were asking.\", 'This is a surprisingly popular question these last couple weeks. You may find [this thread]( and [this thread]( interesting. I\\'ll quote my answer from the second one: \\n > This has been recently discussed  here . But we still aren\\'t sure what space is \"made of\".\\n>\\nTo be sure, there are some models. Simplistically, general relativity says that space and time together form one higher-dimensional surface (a [manifold]( that exists independently of what\\'s on it. But general relativity doesn\\'t mesh very well with quantum mechanics at the highest energies and the smallest scales, and many physicists think that there\\'s a quantum picture of what space is that we don\\'t have yet. One example of an idea in this realm is that of [quantum foam](\\n>\\nWe probably won\\'t be able to thoroughly test any ideas about the quantum nature of spacetime for a long while because the energies we would need to reach for experiments are absurdly high. This is one of the biggest open problems in physics, and you can read more about it by looking for stuff on [quantum gravity]( While this is a broader topic, a theory of quantum gravity might one day give us insight into the nature of what spacetime actually is.', \"Yeah, maybe I was simplifying too much. The rigorous statement is that the reals are [isomorphic]( (via a [ring homomorphism]( to any [complete]( [Archimedean]( [ordered field]( \\n You can definitely define a [total order]( on the points of the plane, like the one you describe. The difficulty lies in defining an ordering that's compatible with the operations of a [field]( \\n It should be noted that the plane isn't a field (in the above sense) all by itself\u2014fields have a notion of multiplication, and there are many different possible definitions of multiplication you could use to give the plane a field structure.

We conventionally write  i  = (0,1) and 1 = (1,0). \\n In other words, this field has  i ^2 = -1. Sound familiar? This is just the complex plane! But there is no way to order the elements of the complex plane in a way that respects the field structure. \\n You might think that there should exist  some  field structure on the plane that can be ordered. And formally, you can indeed find these!

Second, and more importantly, there are many different and effective strategies for overcoming this kind of existential angst and ennui.  Meaning is a fascinating and funny thing, and I\\'ve actually been conducting scientific research on modern sources of existential meaning for several years now.  I struggled deeply with these issues myself a while back, to the point where it was debilitating - life has no meaning, everyone is walking around in painful ignorance of this fact, the world is falling to pieces, and nothing we do will ever matter.  Sound familiar?  Thing is, if you start reading some of the classics, you\\'ll quickly find that existential concerns have driven much of human creativity and thought since time immemorial - you\\'re in great company, and I personally found a lot of comfort just in that discovery alone.  One of my favorite examples of this was reading Meditations by Marcus Aurelius.  A Roman emperor, living thousands of years ago, struggling with the exact same questions and insecurities I\\'m grappling with today - who knew?  In fact, as some of the other responses in this thread have suggested, the most jarring realization that I had during this time was that most people - on varying levels of consciousness - are dealing with these issues too.  People put up a lot of barriers, because the world\\'s a scary place and we\\'re all trying to pretend like we have it all figured out to save face - but if you randomly pick someone of the street, get to know them a bit, and have an authentic conversation with them about these things, most people will open right up and reveal the same underlying concerns.  We\\'re all in the same boat, we\\'re all human and we know it.

Meaning can be created in many different ways - by picking up a book and engaging with new ideas, by picking up a paintbrush and actualizing your own creative visions (self-actualization), or by putting the paintbrush or book down in favor of going outside to spend time with your friends, family, or even just by yourself, enjoying the company of the world\\'s natural beauty (self-transcendence.)

Old books are straight to the point, new books give tons of \"examples\" of things and a hell of a lot more problems at the end of the chapters. Another key difference is the principles of the forces behind chemistry. So many new things have been found out since then and will (should) be in a newer edition.

Every movement of a particle, or, if you prefer the soul, every thought, every emotion and every sense, is a change. These changes separate you from your past and your future. Plus, you cannot know, for certain, that your memories are correct (of course, the only things you can prove are things you define yourself, if you're a fallibilist like me). You cannot prove that you were conscious before  this  instant, and you cannot know that you'll still be after it. But, what is in instant? There may be no such thing, if time is continuous, which is something we usually assume in math. \\n From this I extend that you're continuously dying (in terms of consciousness) and  you  don't exist, because  you  can have no perfectly accurate definition (even with non-local hidden variable theories in QM), even if it isn't known to you. You can only define yourself within an interval of time, which could  always  be reduced. \\n However, looking at our brains, our experience probably is discrete, but not in regular intervals. But, this means you acknowledge the existence of physical objects (as opposed to being  the  solipsist), and the brain (as opposed to the mind or soul) is probably continuously changing.\", 'Testing the hypothesis that the brain is the seat of consciousness would be science, but nobody has yet designed an experiment that shows anything more than correlation. Correlation does not imply causation. \\n What about magnetic stimulation and psychoactive drugs, in general? Anesthesia\\'s a pretty good bridge between the brain and consciousness. Are you saying that these are just correlations? It just so happens every time I give X person Y drug, Z happens, even after comparing with placebo?

Essentially, you are saying that if you like an idea, or scientists you agree with assume it, then it is science, and if you don\\'t then it must lie outside science. \\n I\\'m not defining science by belief, but anything beyond the possibility of empirical evidence is beyond science (of course, we can\\'t always know or agree upon whether something is beyond this possibility or not, as in the case of string theory). Physicalism sticks with that evidence (and, of course, doesn\\'t question the possibility of \\'true\\' evidence) and does not venture beyond it. It\\'s just like how Copenhagen was (maybe not so much anymore) the most popular, and justifiably so, of the interpretations of Quantum Mechanics, because Bohr was a logical positivist and outright rejected what he could not observe/measure. There was also the intrumentalist \"shut up and calculate\", which is a true lack of interpretation. I\\'m agnostic about the existence of God, but I\\'m also an atheist, because I can\\'t support His existence (with science). So science may be more like agnosticism and instrumentalism, in the sense that it avoids interpretation, but if an interpretation is useful (like Copenhagen was), then one which does not assume more than science and rejects all else is preferable. Some things like our supposed subjectivity and realism are nice and intuitive, but these are perceptions that science does not have much to say about (although Bell\\'s theorem shows that the counterfactual definiteness type of realism is incompatible with locality) and that we should thus question. Since science doesn\\'t point to realism, I don\\'t believe in it. I like it; I used to  prefer  the counterfactually definite but nonlocal de Broglie-Bohm interpretation of Quantum Mechanics, but there are experiments that may be disproving it (or making it more and more contrived to get around the results of these experiments).

Now, there are ways to \"sense\" this, using concrete examples for the abstractions: you hold one apple in each hand and then put them in the same hand, and, now, you\\'ve got two apples in one hand. So, there are ways to imagine or \"sense\" relations (most of them, I would think, but not higher spatial dimensions, for example) in mathematics, but they don\\'t need to be \"sensed\" to be true, like with subatomic particles, as darth_choate mentioned.

I\\'m a nihilist in many of its forms, but logic and nihilism, itself, are the only exceptions to my epistemological nihilism. In the end, most of what I consider true (physical reality), I consider true pragmatically.  Ideally , there is only logic. \\n Let\\'s assume we\\'re living in a computer simulation, so that our physical reality is programmed. Now, the \"programmers\" would have their own physical reality, which likely wouldn\\'t be the same as our own (unless they\\'re attempting an exact copy). The symbols for their mathematics would be different (in fact, they may not even use symbols, because they may not even \"see\", but I doubt that), although the concepts behind them would still hold. Evidently, the theory that  we\\'re  in a simulation is not falsifiable, but it\\'s very easy to imagine  us  creating our own simulation. So, now, we get to choose physical reality, and, if, eventually, intelligent \"life\" were to evolve in our simulation, to them, it\\'s still true that 1+1=2, regardless of the representation. Obviously, to us, their mathematics would be describable in terms of computer science, mathematics and our physics, so we would see a physical manifestation, but  they  wouldn\\'t have access to our computers and our physical reality. They\\'d have access to their \"brains\" and \"neural connections\", but the point is that the representation on the two levels of existence could be fundamentally different, such that, although your \"1\", my \"1\" and my computer\\'s \"1\" are similar in that they use the same types of matter, forces, etc., our \"1\"s and their \"1\"s may be very different (they don\\'t necessarily have cells or even electrons, for example). The terms \"neural network\" and \"brain\" could therefore be used abstractly, because theirs would be analogs to ours. I also don\\'t agree with what woodhuck64 said (\"Abstractions, including numbers and logic, only exist as neural connections.\" Evidently, our computers (usually?) don\\'t use neural networks, but they still perform mathematical computation, whether or not they have qualia, \"the subjective quality of conscious experience\", to quote Wikipedia.) The term \"computer\" is already used pretty abstractly; there are mechanical \"computers\", like the Antikythera mechanism, and biological ones: our brains and DNA (even though they use the same matter and forces, so they\\'re different combinations of the same fundamental physical properties and laws). \\nEventually, the definition of \"existence\" also comes into question. If we created them, does their physical reality \"exist\"? We can watch them perform experiments to study their matter, but we cannot do the same with their matter, because we don\\'t have access to it in the same way they do.

We also know the electron in the Hydrogen atom only absorbs and emits certain discrete amounts of energy in the form of photons of certain discrete wavelengths or frequencies. \\n [From Wikipedia]( \\n \"In physics, a quantum (plural: quanta) is the minimum amount of any physical entity involved in an interaction.

Because your examples are arbitrary, I could say that \"1 thing\" is not \"1 thing\", which in no universe or reality is/was/will be true, unless you redefine \"is\" or \"not\" (which changes the relationship). An equation doesn\\'t change what you have; it\\'s just a reformulation of it.  How could something not be what it is?  Things  are  what they  are , and things  aren\\'t  what they  aren\\'t . You\\'re claiming that this may not be true (even if in other \"universes\" or \"realities\"). It\\'s always true that 1+1=2 (when we define all of the terms in the same way), because 2 is just another representation of 1+1; they describe the same system. Mathematical operations don\\'t actually  do  anything to the relationships in equations (e.g. you don\\'t have to put one apple and another apple together to get two apples: this is one apple and that\\'s another apple; if I consider them both at the same time, they\\'re two apples); they just demonstrate another way of looking at the same thing. \\n The closest real physical examples to what you\\'re describing that I can think of are in relativity. For example, relativistic velocity addition, such that .5c + .5c isn\\'t 1c when you change reference frames (and because of the conservation of relativistic momentum and energy, the curvature of spacetime and the limit on speeds of massive objects): a stationary observer on Earth could watch two rockets either both coming towards or leaving him/her, moving in opposite directions, at half of the speed of light, but from the perspective of either one of the pilots in the rockets, the two rockets would not be moving towards or away from each other at the speed of light. By changing reference frames, you\\'ve actually  changed  the system: not all reference frames are equivalent, which basically summarizes relativity. It does not mean that .5 + .5 != 1, though, because you would have lost the necessary conditions. It means that intervals of time, speeds, lengths are different from one reference frame to another. If you don\\'t change reference frames, it\\'s still true that .5c + .5c = .5c + .5c = 1c (but .5c + .5c = 1c would be meaningless, as far as I can tell; it doesn\\'t describe anything real). The equation actually gives different symbols for velocities of the same object from one reference frame to another, to quote a physics textbook: \\n u = (v+u\\')/(1 + vu\\'/c^2)      (straight line only) \\n v : velocity of object 1 with respect to an inertial observer \\n u\\' : velocity of object 2 with respect to object 1 \\n u : velocity of object with respect to the same inertial observer \\n c : the speed of light in a vacuum', \"Say you're using a gun that will either shoot you or not based on the measurement of a particle in superposition (a qubit or the radiation or absence of radiation from a decaying atom), there's time between the measurement and your death. You'll be alive inbetween, albeit not conscious of whether the gun actually shot anything or not, or of the results of measurement, but conscious nonetheless. There's nothing that will kill you in the same instant that decoherence occurs. The decoherence caused by the measurement (whether or not anyone witnessed it) happens before the gun is fired. Basically, you're already in either the state of alive or dead before the gun is fired. Yes, within many-worlds, there should always be a live and conscious version of you in the multiverse, so if many-worlds is correct, quantum immortality is, too, but there's no reason to believe the one in this universe, considering only the quantum suicide experiment (i.e. ignoring a meteor crashing near your building and breaking the apparatus) is going to survive after the qubit is measured to be in the state that will correspond to blowing your brains out. You're already in one of the two universes. Your fate is sealed before the gun is fired. So when you get shot, you'll just be dead. Of course you can't 'experience' death, but your consciousness won't be carried along. The experiment wouldn't be a test of quantum immortality, so it wouldn't be able to distinguish between many-worlds and Copenhagen.\", 'My point is that science can\\'t demonstrate free will. Chaotic systems, for example, might have at first seemed random, but we\\'ve demonstrated that they are not. \\'Free will\\' is basically saying \\'You can\\'t explain that\\' (to quote O\\'Reilly); it\\'s the conclusion that there is not a deterministic answer, but \\'free will\\', like the randomness of QM, is something that\\'s apparent, but to conclude \\'free will\\' is to take the leap from \"I don\\'t know\" to \"it can\\'t be known\". How can you know when you\\'ve found \\'free will\\'? How can you know that something can\\'t be known? When should we tell science to give up looking for a deterministic explanation? Maybe QM is nearing that point, but \\'free will\\' makes the assumption that something isn\\'t there, just because we haven\\'t observed it yet, but we also haven\\'t looked hard enough or hit a wall like QM. Heisenberg\\'s Uncertainty Principle limits what we can observe, whether it\\'s fundamental or emergent, so although we may never be able to prove that QM is deterministic, we can\\'t know that it isn\\'t, and it isn\\'t necessary to invoke God or the nonphysical to  try  to support determinism (take the de Broglie-Bohm theory as an example of this, although it\\'s starting to look like a worse candidate with these experiments on pair production, which is the result of a fundamental, as opposed to emergent as dBB would interpret it, Uncertainty Principle).

Quantum fluctuations allow for the creation of particle-antiparticle pairs of virtual particles, and this must unequivocally be fundamental, because of its confirmation through experiment (?). Even though the uncertainty principles are easily derived from one another, does the de Broglie-Bohm theory give more weight to the energy-time one as fundamental because of the creation of virtual particles? If the energy-time uncertainty principle is fundamental, should it not follow that the momentum-space one is, too?

It is simplified because the groups do not form rigid hierarchies, and the hierarchy depends strongly on context. For example, two wolves that are subordinate to another wolf individually may be dominant to that wolf when together.

There do tend to be dominant males and females, who mate the most, but almost all pack members have the opportunity to mate.', 'Although I haven\\'t read the entire Old Testament, I don\\'t think the original version had a conventional hell at all.

I would state it as \"Things that reproduce themselves most efficiently reproduce the most\"; as that is vague enough to encompass most of what we would call life, as well as non-life which \"evolve\" through natural selection like viruses and memes. The real problem with this is statement is its lack of predictive power (it can\\'t predict what will reproduce most efficiently, that must be known) and that it isn\\'t immediately obvious whether a constant process of evolution would occur or if the reproducing entities would hit a point of maximum reproductive potential and stop evolving at that point.

These strategies would then influence each other, such as in the case of a large population of [r-strategy]( organisms leading to the development of a smaller population of carnivorous k-strategy animals.

First, it speaks to the weakness of the international community (America included) and secondly it demonstrates that there might not be universal moral revulsion to the use of non-conventional weapons. \\n The first point about weakness is obvious. It\\'s in America\\'s national interests to appear strong - which means that if America talks the talk, it must walk the walk.

I really recommend that people read at least excerpts from Hans Morgenthau\\'s  Politics Among Nations  or even something a touch more modern such as Shiping Tang\\'s  A Theory of Security for Our Time: Defensive Realism . \\n Either work, or the breadth of IR theory will demonstrate why America\\'s national interests extend beyond its borders, which is why completely removing itself from humanitarian interventions, or interventions as a whole is just a terrible idea. \\n About the rest of your question though, what would happen? \\ninternational laws and norms wouldn\\'t be as effectively enforced as they are right now. Which means that even though they\\'re enforced sporadically and inconsistently today, it would be worse in a world without American military assets to rely on. \\n Britain and France have a long and successful history of helping the cause, but neither state, or other NATO allies have the power to go it alone (or even together) without America in an armed conflict without seriously jeopardizing their own national interests. See, France and Britain don\\'t just homeport their navies and armed forces waiting for the United States to say \"Let\\'s go get\\'em boys\" - they\\'re actively enforcing their own national interests elsewhere all the time. Meaning that any emergency intervention would either go unanswered or would require other states to make sacrifices that they might not be willing to make. \\n This is where America\\'s assets come in handy. American military power is so damned strong that it can usually safeguard national interests  and  participate in emergency situations. Other states cannot do the same.', \"The Prop 8 Case (Hollingsworth v. Perry) was punted back to California because the state declined to defend the law in the courts. In turn, a group of people who supported Prop 8 decided to appeal a ruling overturning the amendment. \\n The court ruled that those people who undertook the defense of Proposition 8 did not have the standing to do so - in other words, they had no tangible legal interest (demonstrable injury, investment etc) to defend the case. \\n So the court said 'no, you don't have standing' which means that they were unable to rule on the case. Meaning, that they did not make a nation-wide ruling, and the Circuit Court (that allowed the third party to appeal) was told to dismiss the case. Californians of all sexual identities can now marry.\", 'Well first, thanks for the feedback. I really appreciate reciprocation between moderators and posters since it helps us all learn to improve the sub together. \\n I don\\'t think it\\'s fair to label it as a \\'needs citation hammer\\' - it\\'s more of a friendly request to back up claims with some sourcing. I really try to be friendly and polite in all my dealings (here and elsewhere) because I find tone tends to get lost on the internet for lack of body language or vocal cues. \\n Hypothetical answers can still have sourced replies. In essence, the point of theory is to provide explicative and predictive rigor to answers. So in other words, if there is no literature on a given topic (either because it lacks research or research is simply hard to find) one can always fall back to a more elementary source. \\n For example, if someone asks me a question about my own field (perhaps about something like \"What if the United Kingdom and the United States were competitors in the international system) and I little to no research on it (because it\\'s purely hypothetical) I would turn to political theory rather than hard empirical data. \\n So In this hypothetical situation I might turn to the writings of Jeffrey Taliaferro, Shiping Tang, John Mearsheimer, Henry Kissinger, or Hans Morgenthau. The list goes on and on. If those theorists don\\'t give me the answers I\\'m looking for, I go back farther to Kant, or Rousseau, or Hobbes, or Machiavelli. If those fail, I\\'ll dust off Thucydides. \\n My point is that anything can be sourced. The difference between speculation and a hypothesis is that the hypothesis is grounded in literature and not layman guessing. Hypotheses do not require hard and fast empirical data, philosophy and theory provide rigorous foundations for answers all the same. \\n I want to also add that I became a mod quite recently, and until then I had no idea just how many rule breaking posts are made daily. It really is mind blowing, but only mods really see the full extent of it. People might be surprised. \\n Anyway', 'A topic that I\\'m  intimately  familiar with! Hurray! \\n Alright, so let\\'s do a quick and dirty revision of realism. Realism has a few historical antecedents like Thucydides (The strong do what they will, the weak suffer what they must), Hobbes (particularly for his thoughts on the state of nature, particular that the state of nature encourages barbarism, and humans are inherently in conflict), and E.H. Carr for his 1938 book  The Twenty Years Crisis  in which he tears apart the international liberalism of the 1918-2938 period. \\n Carr argues that liberalism as envisioned by Woodrow Wilson failed because it could not stop the world from going to war in 1938. Liberalism at its core argues that people are inclined to peace and believe that peace is inherently possible. Peace can be achieved by institutions and norms etc. Except these institutions and norms failed to stop WWII. \\n So after the war, Hans Morgenthau comes along with his 1948 book  Politics Among Nations . Morgenthau lays out the [6 Principles of Realism]( that form the foundation of the entire school of realism as we understand it today. Not to say that every point is still relevant, but they\\'re tremendously important for context. Anyway, Morgenthau\\'s stuff holds up for a while, primarily because it could explain the state of the international system in the post-war period. \\n In 1957, Kenneth Waltz comes along and argues that Morgenthau got some stuff right, but he also got some stuff wrong. Whereas Morgenthau emphasized the importance of human nature (I.E. Hobbesianism), Waltz preferred his structural understanding of the international system. In  Man, the State, and War  he argues that there are three images (or levels of analysis) in the study of war. First, he argues is the study of human nature (like Morgenthau\\'s work), the second is that wars occur because of domestic structures. Finally, the third image is systemic. Waltz argues that structure rules all - the international system is controlled by balancing, bandwagonning, alliances etc. \\n In 1975, Waltz adds to his earlier theory by arguing that the international system is inherently anarchical, and in anarchy states are ordinated by their material capabilities (I.E. Power). \\n But oh shit!  What happens in the late 1980s and early 1990s? Right, the collapse of the Soviet Union. But why is this important? Because Waltz\\'s theory suggests that in a balanced system the Soviet Union should not have collapsed as it did. And when a theory loses predictive value, what the hell good is it anyway? \\n So the 1990s was a bit of a chaotic time for realists, because all of the sudden Waltz was sort of caught with his theoretical pants down. However, a bunch of theorists start looking back to classical realism (like Morgenthau) for guidance. Eventually, neo-classical realism comes around and it\\'s sort of a synthesis between Structural Realism (Waltz) and Classical Realism (Morgenthau). There\\'s a great article out there by Gideon Rose that outlines the theory cohesively, but simply put it places a premium on relative material capability within the international system. However, it includes a bunch of other ideas like perception, and willingly incorporates domestic variables. \\n Neo-classical realism is sort of still relevant, but it gets a bad rap for being \\'intellectually inconsistent\\', which is snarky academic talk for \\'you\\'ve created a theory with contradictions.\" Anyway, many still use it, but it\\'s really only good for analyses in which material power matters. It wouldn\\'t make much sense to use a material power analysis for a discussion of say... Mexico\\'s role in the international system. \\n However, structural realism gave way to two related and somewhat useful realist theories. First and perhaps more famous, John Mearsheimer\\'s [ Offensive Realism ]( argues that states are power maximizers, not interested in bandwagonning or balancing. Suffice it to say, it\\'s new-ish because  Tragedy of Great Power Politics  was only published in 2001. It\\'s new... but no one really uses it? Certainly not foreign policy people in government - it\\'s way too aggressive and would never make a popular foreign policy as whole. \\n The other sort of \"cousin\" of structural realism is [ Defensive Realism ]( Defensive realism holds that states are interested in survival like every other realist theory, except that instead of power maximization and material capability at the fore - security is the main variable. Defensive realists tend to incorporate geography, technology, offensive-defense balances, alliances, and finally a state\\'s foreign policy can be the product of domestic considerations - not just responses to the international system. \\n Defensive realism makes a lot of sense to use when you\\'re doing an analysis of middle power, or low-power states. I know I used it heavily for my thesis on Ballistic Missile Defense in Canada. \\n Finally, there\\'s some work being on with social psychological approaches to inside-outside dynamics with realism. Basically, realists assume that states are antagonistic because of inherent differences. However, there\\'s been no way to test it until recently. I need to find the paper I\\'m thinking about, but instead of first-image human nature theorists who use non-empirical philosophy, social psychologists are trying to do a human nature explanation using test subjects. Look up Social Identity Theory and realism, it\\'s pretty hot. \\n So', \"It depends on the circumstances surrounding NATO's call to action. \\n The North Atlantic Treaty is  very  specific in the situations it would allow for the mutual defense clause to be enacted. \\n >  Article 5  The  Parties  agree that an  armed attack against one or more of them  in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all and consequently they agree that, if such an armed attack occurs, each of them, in exercise of the right of individual or collective self-defence recognised by Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations, will assist the Party or Parties so attacked by taking forthwith, individually and in concert with the other Parties, such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force, to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area. \\n Article 5 can't be invoked unless the attack happens against a signatory - which Ukraine is not. Attacking Ukraine wouldn't enable Article 5 unless the attack is considered to somehow directly impacted a NATO member (Poland, Lithuania, etc) \\n That's the reason why the US and Canada are leaving it to the Europeans. It's not that we don't care or don't see the strategic shitstorm headed our way - It's that we have no legitimate grounds for intervention just yet.\", \"Alright, I'll risk the potential for acrimony and endless inbox messages telling me why I'm wrong. To put this in context, I completed my graduate education in International Relations with a specific focus on American-Canadian security issues. \\n Snowden's leaks run the risk of weakening American power on the international scene if we accept that power is inclusive of material (guns, warships, tanks etc) and non-material factors (influence, authority etc). The leaks pose a problem because they serve to embarrass the United States in the face of its allies and demonstrate weakness in its internal security processes in what should be some of the most secure institutions of the state. \\n So Snowden managed to dent American influence among its allies (even if everyone does spy on one another, it still doesn't look good) and now states that are genuinely interested in weakening American power have cause to believe that they might be able to successfully challenge it in ways not previously possible. Essentially, it's a problem that emboldens potential enemies and makes allies less keen to back American interests. \\n So why is a weakened America a problem? The United States has actually successfully maintained international peace through its existence as a world hegemon (especially if you suscribe to [Hegemonic Stability Theory]( and a strong America lends economic stability because of its immense consumer base and the fact that the USD is still the reserve currency of the world. So remember, peace through power, stability though power. These are fairly core principles of [realism]( So with the United States' non-material power weakened, it's not able to project itself as effectively as it was once able to do. \\n Now, let me caveat a bunch of stuff I've just said. The damage is  proportional  - so I'm not saying 'Snowden will cause international chaos'. What I'm suggesting is that his leaks, in the greater scheme of international relations has the  potential  to make life difficult for the United States and its allies. The United States has  a lot  of power to go around, so no one can say what the immediate impact will be. My argument is simply that there is the  potential  for a decrease in non-material power - which negatively impacts the United States and its allies. \\n Also, my arguments don't care about internal American politics or law. I don't care if what he did was illegal, or legal, those are inconsequential to my argument. He might be legally justified, he might be ethically/morally justified, and that's fine. But in this analysis, ethics, morals and law mean precisely bunk. Power (in this analysis) is essentially all that matters. What I personally think about the morals/ethics/law of all this is completely separate (but it may or may not be similar) to my analysis of the international implications of his actions.\", 'This should be fun. To give my answers a little more context, I\\'m Canadian and not American, so the answer to my last question might be coloured by a slightly external viewpoint. \\n >Why do you consider yourself a liberal? \\n I consider myself somewhere between a classic economic liberal and a neoliberal. I love free markets and enterprise, I think it does more harm than good from a practical perspective. However, there is room for the government to act as a redistributive force for good - hence why I barely qualify as a neoliberal. \\n >What disagreements (major) do you have with Libertarianism? \\n Oy, this will be long, but here we go \\n Libertarianism is generally ahistorical  - What I mean by this is that those who argue for pure libertarianism generally do not do so from a historicist perspective, preferring to rely on normative judgments. An example of a historicist philosophy is something like Marxism, where Marx used history to demonstrate that the proletariat has been continually subjugated by the propertied class. I\\'m not saying that I buy all of Marx\\'s arguments (otherwise I would call myself a Marxist, not a Classical Liberal/Neoliberal), but I think in the absence of empirical data, historicism lends at least a little heft to philosophy. \\n I believe in collective identities/rights  - What I mean is that I believe people hold rights by virtue of collective identity. For example, I /u/thornplebeian hold rights by virtue of being a Canadian citizen. I don\\'t hold rights by virtue of being an individual separate from my collective Canadian identity. Should that identity change, the nature of my rights also change. \\n One of the things I think libertarianism gets wrong (by virtue of my next point, that I hope to get to soon) is that we all posses intersecting collective identities, which are subject to different sorts of societal pressures that can impinge on certain rights we are owed as members of groups. For example, I\\'m Canadian, gay, white etc. I derive a sense of self from my belonging to those collectivities. Much like Marx, who never argued for the rights of individual workers and only workers as a group, I think collective identities are  critical  to understanding social behaviour. Now, libertarianism places a dramatic emphasis on individuality (and individual agency, that I\\'ll get to shortly), and you can\\'t reconcile libertarian philosophy on individual rights with the existence of collective identities (hello ahistoricism at work!). \\n Libertarianism is too reductionist  - What I mean is that it reduces the complexity of social interaction down to the nature, wants and needs of the individual. Like I said before, collective identities exist and operate in society, therefore it makes little sense to reduce our understanding of societal rights to individual people. \\n The Structure and Agency Problem  ( for reference  is that libertarianism places an emphasis on  choice . Individuals have the  choice  to behave freely, and can be expected to sink or swim at their own design. The problem is that not everyone necessarily has this choice, and they\\'re subject to  structural  impediments that prevent them from accessing all available options to make a choice. Now, I\\'m not nearly as strict a structuralist as maybe a Marxist would be, but I still think that structure prevents the selection of choice (i.e. the use of agency) enough to prevent libertarianism from being an actual workable thing. Now this is where I sort of want to go off the rails and pick apart this things called \"Socialist Libertarianism\" (yes, I realize there are books on it), but for me the defining feature of socialism/marxism/communism/gramscian thought is  structure , and libertarianism completely throws out structure in the name of agency. It\\'s like saying \"I\\'m a structuralist who believes in pure agency\" - What?! \\n Anyway, back on the rails just in time to wrap up. Basically I think the']": "Based on the postings, the user is interested in international relations, specifically in the areas of American national interests, military interventions, human rights violations, international laws and norms, realism theory, NATO, and the impact of Snowden's leaks on American power and influence in international relations.", "[\"I am doubtful that this will work.  The last time the left was truly united was under FDR, there have been some ups, but overall the last 70 years has been a gradual disintegration of the FDR coalition.  Just looking at the kinds of people FDR had for vice president, Wallace was debatably Buddhist, and clearly very leftest in ideology.  In fact he was attacked for being to extreme which led FDR to choose a new vice president in his last campaign where the safer choice was either Truman (a moderate anti corruption figure) or Justice Douglas, who proved to be one of the supreme court justices furthest to the left. \\n The democratic party at the time included socialists communists, blacks, southerners, populists, the poor, and new money.  This coalition broke down, the southern dixiecrats left first, and by 1992 the very few of these factions were still supported.\\nWhy was this?  Well to understand that I say we look at how the Republican party became the fairly disciplined and unified party they have been until fairly recently.  They talked about ideology.  Before Reagan you had the social conservatives duking it out with the libertarians.  Reagan layed out and preached how he thought the economy should work, how he thought society should work, and it wasn't that people necessarily agreed with it, it was that over time hearing it they became indoctrinated. The ideas Reagan layed out for how government should work did not meet the reality of his policies, it didn't matter, it did not match the thinking of most republicans at the time, but it did by the end of his term.  He unified the factioned republican party by giving an explanation however flawed of how things worked, and the people listened and we today still talk about economics, deficits, and military under his shadow.  Times have changed, but noone has given the American people a new ideology. \\n Meanwhile democrats have played the party of not them, of being distinctly non ideological, in order to try and keep their fractured alliance together.  It doesn't work.  I think Obama had a chance to do this, to lay out a new leftest ideology.  He has instead opted to be a political pragmatist, and has done a good job at getting difficult changes through.\\nWhile these policy goals are great, the media, the public, and the left are all disappointed because they still have their seperate ideologies and the democrats are still talking under a Reagan based framework, where the default position they pragmatically explain away from is that of trickle down economics, and the idea that government is bad.\\nDeep Water Horizon was a chance to preach and convert people to the merits of environmental regulation, the dangers of further dependence on oil.  Instead it managed to be a blip that seems to have changed politics less than the much smaller event in Alaska about 2 decades prior.  That is a failure to promote a message. \\n I know any of you dilligent enough to read this far are thinking, isn't that the point? Isn't that why we need this, we need a coherent message?  As much as I like grassroots movements for change, the answer is NO.  Even if Greens, socialists, anarchists could come up with the ideal platform, it wouldn't matter.  It wasn't the christian right and the libertarians who decided to settle their differences.  It is a top down change, we need to start having democrats willing to lay out a new paradigm for how the economy, jobs, and government work.  For what role we as citizens should have in society and what role government should have in our lives.  Until someone can stand up and confidently deliver that message, until we can create a new paradigm the coalitions can't meld.  Because every side has their own policy motivators their own pet issues, and it takes an overarching picture for how things work that will unite us.  We need to have someone stand up and explain how under this philosophy all your different goals will be resolved.  We will still be mad, and the socialists will still have different goals than the populists, and the greens will be pissed that more isn't being done in this area, but we will all talk about the issues the same way.  That change can't be made grassroots though, that change has been something a figure with a dominant personality injects among the populous.\", \"I think this is true... but I think it was kind of more complicated. \\n If I am wrong on any of this someone please correct me, but this is my understanding.\\nBanking became a major issue in Iceland, and the conservative party had been pushing banking deregulation, and moving to big banking money.  In this process which started in the late 80's and picked up through the 90's Icelandic wealth shot up FAST.  The country had unprecedented growth.  All the wealth and value that they had however was from foreign investors.  Iceland has 300,000 people and its big export is fish.  The money that was being poured into their banks was coming from all over Europe. \\n Where in the United States bailing out wall street, helped the banking industry, it also helped every business that had things invested in that industry.  These industries lobbied and fought to save their skin, because the downfall of wallstreet would have hurt them significantly, it wasn't just the banks.  In Iceland all these businesses that would be effected were external to the country.  They would have been essentially been bailing out their banking industry for the sake of Europe, not Iceland.  When they let their banks fail, it pissed off the international community, and hurt their economy in the short term extremely, but they would recover faster because they essentially didn't bail out a bunch of oversees business.  The UK even put them on a list of terrorist nations so they could stop the banks from recalling money from UK based businesses, as they have a policy of not giving money to terrorist nations. \\n If we were to judge the US economy only on wall street (and some fishing) I think the US would look like our recovery was going quite a bit faster than it looks now as well.\", 'As a sophomore in highschool we watched the movie version of this story.  It was low budget and my friend and I were pretty fascinated with it wondering if it could actually happen.  What I am about to say is pretty unbelievable to me looking back on it, but these things get out of control really really fast. \\n Just a few weeks after watching this film my friend and I were off to be outdoor school counselors.  This third guy who would wear black trenchcoats and went by the name Neo even though his name was Neil was a counselor we met and befriended.  While that short lived trend of Matrix kids was always strange to me Neo won me over with his opening line, \"My parents had raised me with the promise that one day George Lucas would would make more star wars movies, that is why it starts with 4. When I went to the theater and saw episode one I felt how Jerry Falwell would feel if in the second coming Jesus was black.\" \\nThis was the kind of politically incorrect thinking I could get behind.  So my friend and I started talking to Neo about all kinds of things.  Eventually the Wave came up.  My friend and I had joked about what it would be like to do that in the camp, but this was one of the many random hypothetical\\'s we did all the time.  Neo however thought this idea was fantastic.  He latched onto it instantly and said we had to do it.\\nAfter having a conversation where we kind of said we were going to do it we all went off to run our cabins or teach our activities or something. This was back in like 2002 and I don\\'t remember the timeline exactly, but I can tell you that Neo got his whole cabin to draw little waves on the back of their nametags and start doing the wave sign.  I think I remained pretty removed from the entire thing, but like the teachers account says it is hard to remember.  Your brain really doesn\\'t want to let you think of yourself as an instigator to something as powerful as this kind of fascist energy.\\nOn the first day one of the creepiest images in my psyche is remembering Neo with a kid looking at me from accross the field.  He pointed at me and did the wave, and then the 6th grader did the wave, and I did it back with this thought in my mind like what the hell are we doing.\\nSo I knew a couple kids had started doing the wave to eachother, and that Neo had told them that my friend and I both were also part of the wave.  One of the kids I had in my soil class had a wave on the back of his name tag and when the other kids were finding bugs, one of the activities part of the soil program, he started talking really fast to me about it.  He was super excited.  He wanted to see the back of my nametag and see if I had a wave.  I didn\\'t, but put one on in front of him.  We talked a little and you could tell he was super happy to have an upper hand connection with the student running his activity.\\nThe kids started spreading the wave around and it was incredible how fast it grew.  I never indoctrinated anyone or really did anything but just because through the grapevine people had heard I was part of it I was getting extra respect from kids that were not in my cabin and these kids would come and talk to me about the wave.\\nWe didn\\'t do many of the disciplinary things expressed in the original, just a little sense of hierarchy and prestige was all it took.  It was just the desire to belong to something and the idea that they were that gave us extra authority.  I think it was during this second day that one of the campers in my cabin came up to me and told me he was now part of the wave.  He was trying to convince the other campers in our bunk that they should join. \\nI kind of asked him questions like why do you want to be in the wave?\\nWhat do you think the point of the wave is?\\nAnd he said you are in it, its cool come on.  And vague little bursts of excitement.  This kid just loved the idea of being in something secret and something that meant he belonged.  If memory serves there were kids from a few different elementary schools there, so this was a way for them to co-mingle with the kids from other schools.  It was the next morning that things started getting more out of control.\\nKids started running up and flipping peoples name tags yelling your not in the wave your not in the wave.  The camp started to become aware that something was going on.  Wave kids were downright mean to non wave kids at times, and on top of that, they stopped listening or respecting the non wave highschool counselors or adults. \\n The main counselor who oversaw us came and pulled Neo my friend and I out and talked to us about the wave.  He seperated Neo off because I think most of the kids had said he was the leader of it, but talked to my friend and I as well.  He said that a kid had refused to do what he told him to because he only listened to other Wave members.  The guy started asking us about what the hell was going on. \\n We just kind of told him, and downplayed our involvement, in a way throwing Neo under the bus.  In another way I think we really were far more cursory than him.  The head counselor basically told us that we had to end it and that he was going to write about it in our files but we didn\\'t get in any serious trouble.  He made us feel really guiltiy, \"outdoor school is going to be cut, and the last thing we need is a story like this giving them a reason to cut it.\"  We felt terrible, but the thing was that with very little effort, even from Neo, this thing took a life of its own. \\n It wasn\\'t that hard to end it.  We just told the kids that excluding people is bad, we neither had the capability or the escalation to warrant the kind of breakdown that happened in the school that did it.  It just kind of sits as some weird half memory that I ask myself how the hell did that happen?\\nThe point is that if you can make people feel a sense of community and connectedness through giving them something special like a reward, it can be a very powerful tool.  It is startling how quickly that kind of thing gets out of hand.', \"This is the Reddit Comment I was born to write, and it is on my freaking Reddit Birthday, so read it reddit. \\n My short answer for how I would change the US system, (or how I would like to see my state legislature work, if numbers were adjusted) \\n I like the bicameral system and think it creates an oppertunity. \\n \\n Senate: Simple Instant Runoff Voting with one winner, and keep terms the same. \\n \\n House: \\n1)  Have multi candidate districts out of which four representatives are elected, using a multi candidate Single Transferrable Vote method. \\n2) Up the number of representatives in the house of representatives to 1000. \\n \\n \\n Now here is the long explanation of why I think this is the best system. \\n First we need to look at the goal of represenation.  In my mind we are trying to take the complex and scattered views throughout the country, have representatives that can speak on behalf of those views, and then create the best compromise policies possible by looking at the totality of these different viewpoints. \\n \\n Remember originally in the United States Senators were not elected.  It was not mandatory to have senators elected until the 17th amendment in 1913.  The concept was that you would have state interests represented by the appointment of senators by the state (who were elected by the voting public), and then you would have the house which was the direct voice of the people.  The idea was different viewpoints would create better policy.  I am not suggesting going back to this but think it is important when considering what the purpose of having two legislative bodies is, if both are elected the same way. \\n \\n The system of voting in my new Senate is IRV, which has been explained throughout this forum.  Here are two videos if you don't know what it is. \\n[Explained with every day life example]( \\n [Explained in a more traditional way]( \\n \\n \\n Now what effect does this have on the kinds of candidates elected, and the kinds of campaigns run?  Well it means that the candidates elected tend to be more moderate (I know sad for many of us, but that is where the house of reps comes in).  Because we take out the smallest supported candidates first, and let them go to their second choice until a candidate has achieved a majority, we ensure that the candidate is one that is favored at least to some extent, by at least half the population.  Meanwhile voters now can express their preference for smaller parties by voting for them in their early choices which allows these issues to not only gain visability, but gives the more mainstream or popular candidates a chance and a strategic reason to want to court these votes in order to become their second or third choice.  This is also how this system can lead to less negative campaigning. \\n So we have candidates that should approximate the political center of there state in the senate who have been elected by courting minority or single issue party views that seem to resonate with voters.  Sound good right? \\n *Now we move onto the house. \\n The house has a less talked about election scheme, although it is actually similar to the preferential voting used in IRV, and thus the actual way you vote will be completely consistent.\\nThe way this system differs is that you are no longer cutting out the smallest candidates until there is one candidate with a majority, instead we will cut small candidates until we have 4 candidates each with more than 20% of the vote. \\nHere is a video to show how this works [Gummy Bears Voting!]( \\n This system gives minority representation, as any candidate popular enough to achieve 20% support in a district can be a representative. \\n What this means is that now you would have socialists, libertarians, greens, constitution party, working families party, neocon's, business parties, evangelicals, and ideologies of all stripes represented throughout the districts in the country.  These different groups would come together in congress, forming Caucasus's most of the time with no single party able to pass legislation on its own.  Instead the issues that would be passed, would be those that parties could come to agree on.  This means that different kinds of issues would be talked about, pushed, and would be able to pass the house than normally rise to the top of american politics.  Look at issues that cut the political parties, Physician Assisted Suicide laws for example.  Libertarians (who tend to be republicans) tend to like these laws, as do many liberals, yet more mainstream democrats are more warry.  Under our system that means no one wants to touch this issue as it alienates them from their base.  The only states that have the law passed it through referendum, with little support by established politicians.  Other examples are Marijuana legalization, cutting defense spending, and many others.  I find it easier to think of policies I support, but this would really create an environment where many policies I don't like would gain traction as well, however I think it is a better democratic process.\\nSo to counter the moderate nature of the Senate, we instead have voting districts which ensure that in each region many viewpoints can be represented.  (Right now Rural Democrats and Urban Republicans have little voice).  This makes the house the inovative body, coming up with solutions and legislation while the senate ensures nothing to crazy gets passed. \\n \\n Now onto why I would up the house to 1000.  It comes down to campaign financing.  This election system in general makes it more difficult for moneyed interests to get their way.  Under the current system it is easy to pick winners in an election, and easy for moneyed interests to get involved in primaries early to ensure sympathetic candidates rise to the top.  However to do this to all four winning candidates is much more difficult, as each one only needs 20% of their district to support them to win.  It is much easier to get 20% through grassroots efforts, than it is to get 50%.  There are a million things to say about how having more candidates and lower winning threshold would effect campaign money, but I don't want to get to bogged down in it, and instead ask that you think about it yourself as it isn't that hard to figure out. \\n \\n Now the 1000 house members.  If the purpose of lobbying and putting big money into politics is to buy/influence/gain sympathetic votes, then one way to make this much more difficult is add dramatically more votes.  If one congressmen is only one vote of 435 and maybe one of a handful on an important committee, then that is a much more valuable position to buy than if they are 1 in 1000, and one of 2 handfuls in a committee.  This makes lobbying a hell of a lot more expensive, and that is in a first past the post system, in this multi candidate STV system it would have even more of an impact.\\nIn my mind this means more decisions will be made on the merits of the question at hand rather than pissing off the wrong people for reelection concerns.\", 'I likely will get some crap for saying this on /r Socialism... but \\n I think the first thing we need to do before having this conversation is define some terms.  When you say socialism do you mean like straight up Karl Marx socialism?  Or are you talking Democratic Socialism in Scandanavian countries? \\n Are you talking about socialism as an extreme point or as a direction on a spectrum between socialism and capitalism every country exists somewhere on, with none ever being at either extreme. \\n I am going to assume you mean the latter as that is what is debated in most nations.  The idea of complete capitalism or complete socialism are unclear, ill defined, have never existed in practice, and I am doubtful could even actually exist as interests would be there to fix the problems that would occur in either system. \\n So now that we are talking about whether to have socialist or controlled/planned economic policies, or a laissez faire policy is something that most countries look at for each political issue that comes up.  However these are questions of economic policy and for the most part are not completely related to voting or political systems.  Hyper Capitalist dictatorships exist, and like mentioned before some of the most socialist countries in the world are scandanavian and have more proportionally elected governmental bodies than most of the world, this means that these are arguably some of the most democratic nations in the world.', 'Apart from the institutional power the representatives gain over multiple terms, which is what I assume you are referring to, there are many more reasons people vote to keep their representative. \\n The first reason is because we live in ideological pockets.  Redistricting is blamed for this, and is a huge problem, but really it happens naturally just as much.  The fact of the matter is that Urban vs. Rural is a very very real divide in political opinions in the country.  While everyone hates congress as a whole, it is largely because congress is not made up of people like their representative, who represents an area where most people think in that same way. \\n So unless you are talking about a primary challenger, the person who runs against that person in a two party system is always going to be someone most of that district can not stomach. \\n So is the answer to have more competitive primaries?  Again probably not, because when you have a big year for one side or the other you would see a massive swing.  It was and is competitive primaries by an organized base that is making the republicans be so hard line.  You vote for a tax increase and you know they will gun for you. \\n In my mind there are a few true solutions. \\n First one is not my favorite, but likely the one our founding fathers wanted.  More politicians/Smaller Districts.  Increase the size of the house of representatives to say 5000 members.  All of a sudden instead of a Rep representing 750,000 people, more than the mayor of nearly every American city, they instead would represent about 75,000.  This would make elections more local and make the candidates hypothetically less tied to the national party...  All of a sudden door to door campaigning and getting local groups engaged is the most important thing in an election. \\n However while this is the simplest answer, and arguably the answer our founding fathers wanted as many historians think the part of the constitution [on district size was a misprint and they tried to immediately fix it by amendment, which failed]( I tend to think that the size of modern media markets could lead to this type of representation becoming even more party driven.  Maybe a third party would gain some seats, and internal party caucuses would have more power, but still the fate of the party would depend more on national news of the parties image than any individual candidate. \\n That is why I think the better solution is the one pretty much all Americans hate.  I want to impose a style of proportional representation where each district has multiple candidates.  I would advocate [this style of election]( with four member districts.  This would bring in third parties, and increase the regional diversity of existing parties. \\n Imagine if there were rural democrats and urban republicans.  It would be like 30 years ago.', \"I am actually sad this number isn't higher. \\n It is hard to find someone that is 'all' bad.  It is a stupid question to ask if someone is 'all' bad.  If you were going to answer honestly you have to say no, because every major world event effects some people positively and some people negatively.  We as processors of information can say Hitler was terrible, but that doesn't mean he was 'all' bad. \\n Education systems around the world try to demonize people and make some topics off limits.  If you ask me what you are measuring here is how taboo of a subject is Hitler, and we shouldn't care about it becoming less taboo, because we can pretty easily give a complete and honest description of Hitler, and people will still think he was a bad guy.\"]": "Based on the user's reddit posting history, it seems that the user is primarily interested in politics and political ideologies.

Intentional or unintentional results of mocking - the result is 2 campaigns worth of coverage for one guy... for free. \\n 3) The Clinch. In the past, once the nomination was clinched, the media then turns on the chosen republican. I saw it the most with Bush, constantly printing pictures of him with his eye half closed and his mouth open... as if that was the only photo their digital camera captured... But it was the same for McCain, who went from hero to dottering old fool... and Romeny, who went from Businessman to Mr. Monopoly\\'s Evil Cousin Captain Vulture... \\n And the question is - will this post-clinch coverage backfire or work with The Donald? Afterall... how do you make him look bad? Donald is the king of \"I\\'m Rubber, You\\'re Glue\" slinging. \\n I make no bones about being a #NeverTrump republican.

The reasons are: They taste good and/or It\\'s nutritious. \\n Food that we pick for tasting are things like chips, soda, ice cream, while foods that we pick for nutrition are vegetables, healthy protein and complex carbohydrates. \\n The problem is the following: You have subconsciously associated \"food\" to have a conjunction definition of \"taste\" and \"consumption\" when in fact \"taste\" has NOTHING TO DO WITH FOOD. \\n If you define \"food\" as \"the ingestion of matter into your stomach for nutrition\" you will clearly see that the element of \"taste\" has nothing to do with \"food\". \\n Similarly, we can identify \"taste\" independently of \"food\" that is: \\'chemicals contacting your tastebuds triggering a sensation in your brain\\'.

They are matter and fluid that has chemicals that trigger a taste when they are on your tongue, and the only reason you decide to ingest that is because you have  labeled  it \"food\". They should actually just be called \"non-toxic and edible stuff but will kill you slowly and indirectly and is not good for health if eaten so avoid whenever necessary\"... but people still call it \"food\" and this can be very confusing. \\n Story 1: \\n Imagine the following situation.

How do you define races, projected into this racially-mixed future? It\\'s hard/impossible to do that  now , but as your grand project proceeds you\\'ll have more and more trouble. \\n I have no idea how to make a plausible model here. I\\'ll lay out assumptions with  A . \\n A1:  Let\\'s instead assume you pair people who are maximally \"different\". \\n A2:  And that you can approximate all the relevant \"differentness\" by a single variable. \\n If you start with the largest difference, that means you start with the lowest value and pair it with the highest. For the sake of concreteness, maybe this is skin darkness, ranging from very light to very dark. Clearly that\\'s a simplification, and cuts across a lot of current racial boundaries. \\n You work your way through til you\\'re just pairing the two people in the middle of the scale together. So a population like this on the skin scale: 1, 5, 3, 8, 4, 7 gets paired like (1, 8), (3, 7), (4, 5). \\n A3:  The feature value of the children is normally distributed with a mean at the mean of the parents\\' feature values and some fixed standard deviation. \\n This basically just says that kids average out their parents\\' skin tones, but with variation, but that variation is not the same as population variation. \\n The means for the above will be: 4.5, 5, 4.5, with variation. Obviously very similar results. \\n Under these assumptions, the \"lightest\" gets paired with the \"darkest\", the \"second lightest\" with the \"second darkest\", etc. On average, the \"lightest\" will be as far from the mean value as the \"darkest\" is. So the average of the two will be the population mean. Same for everyone who gets paired. \\n This means that under this scheme, every pair of people has children with a mean tone around the world mean, and some fixed standard deviation. \\n If everyone reproduced at once, this would mean that this would just take a single generation. Otherwise, long enough for everyone to get a turn (so three or four).', 'Let\\'s break this down a bit. \\n The time til each die X_i comes up 1 is geometrically distributed with probability 0.2. (Technically it\\'s this plus 1 to make up for the fact you\\'re including the trial where that 1 comes up.) \\n You want the time til half of these dice come up 1. Well, that\\'s the median of all your X_i. Why? Since each X_i is a \"time til success\" we care about the value that\\'s \"after\" half of them and \"before\" the other half -- the median. In general, you care about some quantile. \\n So your quantity of interest is the median of n variables distributed as 1 + Geometric(k = 0.2). Code below in parallel to yours. \\n geomQuantTimeTillWin &lt;- function(n, k = 0.2, prop_needed = 0.5) {\\n\\n  quantile(rgeom(n, k), probs = prop_needed) + 1\\n\\n}\\nsampleSize &lt;- 1000\\nNN1 &lt;- rep(NA, sampleSize)\\nNN10 &lt;- rep(NA, sampleSize)\\nNN100 &lt;- rep(NA, sampleSize)   \\nfor (k in 1:sampleSize){\\n  NN1[k] = timeTillWin(1)\\n  NN10[k] = timeTillWin(10)\\n  NN100[k] = timeTillWin(100)\\n}\\nboxplot(N1,N10,N100,NN1,NN10,NN100)\\n \\n At this point we\\'d like to go to the order statistics of the geometric and find the variance of the median. Unfortunately I don\\'t think there\\'s a nice formula for this. [This blog post]( discusses an approximation to the mean of the maximum with exponential random variables. Might be a good direction for someone to go. I\\'ll try to take another look soon if no one else does. \\n If you have some wiggle room in your problem is framed, you might ask yourself if you can switch to something with a clearer probability distribution. For example, basing it around a negative binomial (rolling until you get some number of successes/failures).', 'I guess I just don\\'t even know how to talk about this stuff when it\\'s so far removed from modern conceptions of nation and race. \\n In a modern context saying someone \"is X\" where X is some regional identifier means they either 1) are a citizen of X, 2) are descended from X, 3) have X as their \"identity\". (1) is irrelevant to this situation, (2) is clearly quite true of Cleopatra, (3) is at least confusing in this case. I thought they e.g. called themselves Egyptian but I\\'m not knowledgeable at all here. \\n In a modern view (2) is most important when it lines up with a common idea of \"race\", which wouldn\\'t include \"Macedonian\". If you say something specific like that you usually mean (1) or (3). But, as you rightly point out, (2) is certainly true in this case. \\n So... that\\'s why to me personally it feels like a weird simplification just to say \"she was Macedonian\" rather than e.g. \"Cleopatra was \\'racially\\' Macedonian\" or \"descended from Macedonians\", though technically it\\'s accurate.', \"Basically it comes down to the fact that languages change. \\n If we assume that language is always changing, as soon as two groups of people are separated enough their languages will start to diverge. Group A's language changes, but that's okay for that group because they talk all the time. They stay up-to-date on the changes. Group B's language changes too -- but there's no reason it will change in the same way. B doesn't talk with A much so they lose touch with changes in A's language. \\n Eventually A's language and B's language are so distinct that they have real trouble talking. Maybe they can't communicate at all. New languages are born. \\n An analogy:  You and your 3 friends have in-jokes you all get. You constantly add new ones and stop using older ones.

I\\'d like to share my production story now. \\n I\\'ve been at electronic music for 5 years now and 2 years before attempting to record my band.  I always thought it was going to be an easy process before I started.   Just get a microphone and put it up to something right?  Fucking wrong. \\n I slowly started to learn keywords and understand that this was no short process.  I had spent countless hours trying to get my music to sound like the music I listened to but no dice.  As I worked harder and harder I came to realize there\\'s certain parts I had to perfect to get some results. \\n The first problem I encountered was the loudness of my music.  Why was it so much quieter than commercial music?  How do people get it so loud without clipping?  I had to find out.  I then learned about headroom and frequencies because before this point I thought an EQ was optional.  While learning about these two things I was also becoming proficient in Ableton Live (a switch from pro tools).  Maybe a year later I was finally accustomed to these things but my music sounded crappy.  How did artists make their drum kits so good? \\n That brings the second problem I had, sound design.  I remember messaging Revolvr before he was a big deal and he responded with vengeance.  I got a ton of vengeance samples and it completely changed my world.  I was stunned by how good the samples were.  But they weren\\'t good enough.  They still sounded pretty bad to me so I took to layering and melding samples together.  Another  year passed and my music was getting better as I moved on the \"mastery curve\".  Now my problem wasn\\'t with the drums but my synthesis.  Honestly my synthesis sucked. \\n That was the third problem.  My synthesis was far too basic.  I started working with as many different VST\\'s as I could.  Massive, sylenth1, Z3ta+, fm8, absynth, and loads of freeware synths in the mix of things.  I learned the different types of synthesis and what each does to make it different from the others.  Now that I had all of this down the problem was that my music hurt my ears. \\n Here\\'s where I learned to mix properly and design my sounds to \"soften\" them and create a pleasurable sound.  I look to deadmau5 often for this sort of thing.  He tends to put out sounds that are so intriguing and they sound phenomenal.   It was at this point where I realized that my studio monitors were much better for production than my $200 computer monitors.  Getting rid of a sub can work wonders.  I used to think you needed I crank the bass to 11 but then I realized headroom would suffer and I couldn\\'t make my music loud thus putting the puzzle pieces together much like this write up states. \\n Today I feel as though my music could be better but it\\'s getting to a level where I\\'d feel comfortable releasing it onto labels.  I\\'ve been producing stock audio for reality companies for awhile now and I\\'m proud of what I do today.  I\\'ve had plenty of let downs where I spend A TON of time on a track and I get disappointed with the end result.  It happens a shit ton guys.

I don\\'t see much in between since postrock was never like Porter and Language was never like postrock.  I don\\'t even know where lines were drawn connecting the music to each other. \\n Instead, I firmly believe that Porter thinks he\\'s more than he actually is.

But having read quite a few and done a fair amount of ocean sailing, for these purposes, I would try and find books that ARE about: Single handers (people operating vessels alone - whether or not you plan to be alone...there is always the chance that you will end up that way) People who have managed to make it self sustaining Sailors who equip and manage their vessel on a very strict budget People who were amateurs that over years logged a lot of miles, and are offsetting their debt by publishing a how to. Lots of honest good stuff in here. \\n Also try learning what you can about Celestial Navigation, Dead reckoning, Weather, seasonal patterns, and global sailing seasons. A great resource for this is The Lo Tech Navigator. Not only does it explain the theory quite well, but also instructs on how you can actually build some critical sea nav pieces yourself. Depending on tech is good, but the failure rate on electronic devices is ultimately 100%. So knowing how to do it all old school...is well...we\\'re all here so we get the value there. Knowing where you are, and what the seasons do in different areas is really a powerful tool to hedge your bets against adverse weather conditions. IMO, knowing how to batton the hatches, douse all sail in 20+ foot seas and deploying a sea anchor is the next best thing to having the best weather info and a super fast sailboat (in SHTF...unlikely and unsafe respectively). \\n Take up some basic sailing courses. Search in your area, there are almost always small sailing associations that you can join for a very small amount if anything and learn to sail at least small dhingys. It has been said by more than one person that these are the absolute best way to learn basic sailing theory as it puts your in a very tactile relationship with the forces at play. \\n Stay clear of books about: Racing, COLREGS (so called rules of the road), older historical stuff, Any type of boating that is not basically a very heavy, sturdy monohull with a traditional (bermuda or junk) sail plans. While these are all very fun and useful, in a bug out...there not going to be a lot of use, because they are all basically recreational or of legal importance, and I think the USCG will have better things to do than to ticket you for failing to follow rules of the road. \\n The Boat: \\n My set up here would be, steel, monohull, full keel, dacron sails, junk rig, preferably between 38 and 45 feet. This covers the basic problems of extended voyages on a sailing vessel. A steel hull will give you better durability. Yes there are issues over a glass boat...but I would rather careen, sand and paint and just blow thru coral that you don\\'t have charts for rather than get sunk. Monohulls...really hard to knock down, and are mostly self correcting in a capsize. While the catamaran in waterworld seemed nifty, if those get knocked over, which they can more easily...game over pretty much. Full keels are more solid in the water, smoother sailing and don\\'t have fins that get stuck if in shallow waters...plus you can carefully careen them on low tides to to bottom repairs with a much reduced risk of damaging the hull...or fin keel. Dacron is the toughest and most durable for the price. Junk rigs while many people will rail against, are slower. But easier to sail alone, easier to reef in rough weather, self tackings, less stress on sail material and reduce rolling of the boat in heavy seas. The size is optimal for comfort, less roll in the swell, and sufficient size to increase speed as the result of a steel hull. \\n Load out: \\n Tons has been written on this and everyone has they bug out supply list in their own mind. All I will say is what my father is fond of saying \"Keep it simple stupid\". The more tech, the more systems you have, the more parts, more weight, more tools you need to have to operate it. I am very much of the opinion that some time spent learning the old school, and keeping the vessel ship shape is way more important than learning to depend on expensive tech which will fail you eventually. If you\\'ve read \"Sailing around the world alone\" a self steering wind vain is replaed by simply learning to ballance the sails and lashing the helm. Just one example. But if all you need is your boat, the required mechanical components (rigging, chain, anchors etc...extra of all of that is worth getting) sails, sheets, etc then you CAN get buy...as the poster mentioned, on 15th century (and way earlier) tech but with a sturdy seaworthy 20th century vessel.. You will be able to outlast all the retirees in factory mint hunters packed with GPS and radar. \\n Necessities: \\n Food gathering supplies (out of scope here). Water gathering supplies. A good rain water collecting system is good, and good holding capacities, and always be on the hunt for land based fresh water supplies. As much diesel as you can carry, and always be on the lookout for more. For power, I am a fan of water impellers. Simple in design, always operating even if you are drifting, easy to repair...just be sure to really tie that sucker on hard. Anything else...vitamins, medicine, etc...obviously whatever you can get your hands on...bring it. I would pack the boat with this before worrying about spending cargo space with tools and parts for tech. Also, as good a set of paper charts and know how to navigate with them. These can be gotten fairly cheaply and in compendium style collections. \\n The bug out mentality:\\nThe interesting thing about sailing for a bug out..is that you have to apply everything we are all trying to learn and assemble just by being readers of this subreddit. Even in a regular sailing voyage, the sea will test you, demand all of your respect and faculties, strength of body and mind. You need not be some tough as nails sailors...teens circumnavigate alone annually. But you will need to muster all of the know how, planning, smarts etc to stay alive.

This became very underground, and was hard to find except in the inner city.  Initially, playing these records back to back in the Wharehouse in Chicago, and Paradise Garage in NYC is where DJing came from.  These records eventually led to providing the sample base for all hip hop with the exception of electro, which was more drum machine rather than sample based originating in detroit.

My only worry for Cap 2 is the amount of CGI/Destruction that will actually be in the movie. When I read initial interviews from Kevin Feige and the writers saying that the movie would be a \"70\\'s political thriller\" I was overjoyed, thinking we\\'d all be in for a unique, gritty, and interesting superhero movie. When I watching the trailer, I got even more pumped, if possible, I thought the political questions they brought up were intriguing, the practical fighting between Cap and Bucky looked badass, but then all of sudden the HELICARRIER is crashing down to the ground in a CGI Extravaganza and the stakes (for me personally) were lowered. \\n Does anyone else share this sentiment? I feel like Superhero movies are going to crazy with the amount of CGI Destruction needs to take place because the creative teams involved feel like they need to raise the stakes however they can. With that said, I feel like they should take a more grounded approach, especially with a character like Captain America, who really is just a \"roided up\" superhero.

Have the expected story points, Barry goes back in time, saves his mom, comes back, the future is different and he has no powers. In my version, Central City is a shit hole, basically see it as Starling pre-Arrow days. I have some other thoughts about maybe Eiling using FIRESTORM as a nuclear weapon type thing and that could be the WW3 replacement for the comics. \\n Barry, confused by what happened, decides he needs to find a way to get his powers back and fix what happened. Some plot happens, and instead of seeking out an Arrow/Batman type figure, he has to find the  real  Harrison Wells. In this timeline, the real Wells wasn\\'t killed/absorbed by Eobard, and is getting ready to do his particle accelerator stuff. I think this could be a really poignant way to go with the story as Barry would have to essentially sacrifice the real Wells again when he fixes the timeline. Also some real Eobard action could get thrown in with Matt Lecshter reprising the role. \\n I think this type of change is likely, because the producers hinted that we\\'d be seeing the \"original\" Eobard again, and like I said, it could be a cool way to bring back the original Wells and make it an interesting dynamic between he and Barry. \\n Your thoughts on this?', 'Here\\'s everything I found on it: \\n In July 2001, Lucas gave his opinion on the matter of what is canon in Star Wars during an interview with Cinescape magazine: \\n \u201cThere are two worlds here,\" explained Lucas. \"There\u2019s my world, which is the movies, and there\u2019s this other world that has been created, which I say is the parallel universe\u2014the licensing world of the books, games and comic books. They don\u2019t intrude on my world, which is a select period of time, [but] they do intrude in between the movies. I don\u2019t get too involved in the parallel universe.\" \\n The Holocron is divided into five levels (in order of precedence): G-canon, T-canon, C-canon, S-canon, and N-canon. \\n G-canon  is absolute canon; the movies (their most recent release), the scripts, the novelizations of the movies, the radio plays, and any statements by George Lucas himself.G-canon overrides the lower levels of canon when there is a contradiction. Within G-canon, many fans follow an unofficial progression of canonicity where the movies are the highest canon, followed by the scripts, the novelizations, and then the radio plays. \\n T-canon [5] refers to the canon level comprising only the two television shows: Star Wars: The Clone Wars and the upcoming Star Wars live-action TV series. Its precedence over C-Level canon was confirmed by Chee.[6] \\n C-canon  is primarily composed of elements from the Expanded Universe including books, comics, and games bearing the label of Star Wars. Games and RPG sourcebooks are a special case; the stories and general background information are themselves fully C-canon, but the other elements such as character/item statistics and gameplay are, with few exceptions, N-canon. \\n S-canon  is secondary canon; the story itself is considered non-continuity, but the non-contradicting elements are still a canon part of the Star Wars universe. This includes things like the online roleplaying game Star Wars: Galaxies and certain elements of a few N-canon stories. \\n N-canon  is non-canon. \"What-if\" stories (such as stories published under the Star Wars: Infinities label), crossover appearances (such as the Star Wars character appearances in Soulcalibur IV), game statistics, and anything else directly contradicted by higher canon ends up here. N-canon is the only level that is not considered official canon by Lucasfilm. A significant amount of material that was previously C-canon was rendered N-canon by the release of Episodes I\u2013III.', \"It will never happen. What would Marvel stand to gain from this crossover?

Even if the movie made 1.5 billion worldwide, Disney would only take in less than 750 Million (when you factor in movie theater cuts, marketing, etc.), it's easy to assume that Avengers 3 will make somewhere around 1-1.5 billion with or without Spider-man, so why bother cutting your profits in half and further boost up Sony's own franchise?

He\\'s not a name you\\'ve seen 20,000 times on fan casts. \\n And the fan casts are actually, I believe, one of the biggest reasons people are upset. Not the fan casts themselves, but more like the principal behind them. After it was announced that Christian Bale/Nolan were done with the Batman franchise way back when TDKR came out, people were already a buzz saying who  they  thought should be the new Batman, there are probably 1000\\'s of fan casts out there, all rabid fans illustrating their ideal choice for one of the most  beloved  characters in the world. \\n Because of that, they (Zack Snyder) could literally have picked ANYONE and there would be a sect of people who would hate the choice, because nearly every fan, whether they posted their idea or not, have already come up with who they want/think should take up the mantle of the Bat. Comic Book fans are probably the hardest group of fans to please, because we all have pre-conceived notions about who we think should portray the character, who should direct, etc, just because these characters are so important to us. \\n I completely get all of the points that are against Affleck, some of which I can agree with.

I attached the socket onto the head of the plug, next the extension, and finally the wrench. With a firm grip, I placed the weight of my arm onto the handle. Unexpectedly the plug yielded and sent my knucle into the still hot header, searing my skin and sending the wrench to the floor. \\n #1 was barely hand tight, so I went in Rambo style with just the socket. Once the plug came out, the first thing I noticed was the oil turned tar running down my hand. Yeah, pretty sure that's not supposed to happen. The plug was completely blackened. \\n I went to tell Orlando who was talking to JD about some lifts, about the plug. \\n >Orlando: Mi Cu\u00f1ado just changed the plugs and oil back when I bought it. \\n About that time Tejas arrived at the scene \\n >Tejas: \u00bfCu\u00f1ado, ahora es el d\u00eda del pedo? \\n >Orlando: No mames guey, didn't you change the plugs right before I bought it? \\n >Tejas: Si guey, but you bought the truck two years ago. \\n >Tejas: Hicimos carnitas, i compramos virongas. \\n Whatever, I continued the arduous task of removing the plugs with my fingers. \\n Then I got to pesky #8, I went to go fetch a swivel adapter in cae of the worst.

(They're in their 50s now.) \\n Once they are out of there, the unit owner could do whatever they like--renovate it, move into it, rent it for market rent, etc. \\n This is a crazy, hot real estate market. The unit itself is well-maintained, though needs updating. The other condo units were extensively renovated prior to sale. If the unit were vacant and sold as-is, it would be worth $450,000. \\n It's hard to estimate how much the presence of tenants to be assumed forever reduces the selling price.... if I were selling it for $1, I'm sure someone would take it, but I wouldn't sell for $1. Despite the hot market, I suspect it would take months to sell, but the unit carries itself so I can wait. I don't  need  the money urgently, but on the other hand, it's money tied up that could be put to better use. \\n So do I wait it out for who-knows-how-long and realize the full value, or do I sell for I-don't-know-how-much-discount and get out of this?  And how much might it be discounted?  At what point is it too much discount?\", \"I am a landlord.  I saw this on /r/legaladvice and addressed it there, but in general, don't panic when a tenant says they are going to the Board. Most of the time they don't. \\n Also, while the Board is not perfect, it's almost always a lot easier to go to the Board and deal with a neutral third party who will hear out both sides, and make a decision.  Most tenants (and yes, a lot of landlords) are ill-informed on the law and haven't a good idea about what they are actually entitled to, and the Board tends to clear through that bullshit a lot faster and with less headache and arguing with each other.\", \"Canada has Interac, which is a cross-Canadian debit system that allows use to use our bank cards for debit transactions and at the ATM. \\n The US doesn't have this.  What they have instead are credit card-backed debit cards that (roughly speaking) use the credit card network to implement debit transactions.  So they use a different card, but it should function (more or less) like a regular debit card as you understand them from Canada.\", 'In my teens and 20s, I never wanted to have kids.  I was very decided and clear on this point, and really freaking pissed off at people who said \"I would change my mind one day.\" \\n Around the age of 30, much to my chagrin, I started rethinking that and began wondering about having kids.  But (among many other things) I got divorced then.  I didn\\'t want kids badly enough to even consider being a single parent, but when I started dating again I would tell people that marriage and kids was what I was looking for.  Though--and I was honest with people on this point--I wasn\\'t thinking that I had to have kids or that my life would be unfulfilled if I didn\\'t. It wasn\\'t a burning desire to procreate. \\n I remarried at 35 and now I am 37 and we are \\'trying\\'.  It\\'s an intimidating thing to start.  Post-divorce I stopped being afraid of taking risks or trying new things, but the idea of having kids scared the shit out of me.... I think, largely, because I learned that the reason I\\'ve been comfortable taking on new things is because I was confident in my ability to undo everything.  With children, there is no undo.  Your life is irrevocably changed.  I rather like my life, so the idea of changing it entirely is fucking scary.  But hey, going for it anyway. \\n Also, with my aged ovaries ( wry grin ) there\\'s a lot less time to futz around trying to see if things work the regular way... I have friends who have gone through IVF, and it\\'s pretty intense.  Neither my husband nor I want kids enough to go through that. \\n If it sounds like I\\'m a little ambivalent on this, I am. I think that is a little more common when you\\'re trying for kids over the age of 35 and officially high-risk because they keep reminding you that you\\'re old. (Woot! Not.) Conventional wisdom is that you should only have kids if you want them more than anything.  That kind of thinking is a bit too black-and-white for my taste.  I want to have kids, but it also scares the heck out of me.  I want to have kids, but not enough to undergo medical procedures to make sure I have them.  I want to have kids, but if it didn\\'t happen, I think my life would still be good and fulfilling to me. \\n It\\'s not so much that there\\'s a concrete point where I said, yes, I have made a decision, as it is that over time, I\\'ve come to realize that I would rather would than not.  It\\'s a hell of a commitment of time and energy and love and emotion and money, it will change my life forever, change my body forever, change my relationships forever... a little ambivalence seems reasonable. \\n I have to say, I\\'m not a fan of babies.  Never have been.   I don\\'t melt at the sign of them.  A friend re-assured me that she was the same way, but it was different with her own.  And, the fun stuff happens when they are a little bit older anyway. \\n As for not being a good mother, pretty much every mother thinks she\\'s not a good mother.  Most of them do okay.  Parenting skills aren\\'t something you\\'re born knowing, they\\'re something you learn as you go.', \"I have a points card with an annual fee, and it works for me because I charge my business expenses on it, and then pay it in full out of the business.... which means thousands of dollars in transactions each month.  So the fee ($120) is something I can recoup fairly easily. \\n For most people, it doesn't work that well because it takes a long time to build up points.  Short-haul flights in North America on Aeroplan are 15,000 points, and cross-country is 25,000.  While there are bonuses and such (and usually a big starter bonus), it's generally about $1 per point, so you will have to charge up $15,000 worth of stuff to get anywhere.  And you will still have to pay taxes and fees... for North America, that's somewhere under $150 (depending on where you are going) but Europe (60,000 points) is still more than $500. \\n If you still want a rewards card, cash-back is a better bet for you, and don't get a card with an annual fee (or one that will have an annual fee later.)\"]": "Based on the user's reddit postings, it seems that the user is primarily interested in the following areas:\n1.

Because they\\'re all the same right? \\n As I said, I\\'m a chinese speaker, so now let me translate the phrase, \"I am very happy because I got a gift from Professor Professorson.\"  in the same way you did in japanese. \\n >I am very happy because I got a gift from Professor Professorson. \\n >\u6211\u5f88\u9ad8\u5174\u5e94\u4e3a\u6211\u4eceProfessorson\u6559\u6388\u6536\u5230\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u793c\u7269\u3002 \\n Now in pinyin: \\n >wo3 hen3 gao1xing4 ying1wei2 wo3 cong2 Professorson jiao1shou4 shou3 dao4 le yi1g4e li3wu4. \\n wo=I; hen=very; gaoxing=happy; yingwei=because; wo=I; cong=from; Professorson=Professorson; jiaoshou=professor; shou=receive; dao le=[verb auxiliaries that indicate past perfect tense]; yige=a; liwu=gift. \\n Now putting it together in literally translated chinese ordered english: \\n >I very happy because I from Professorson professor received a gift. \\n This is the word order that most I think most native speakers would use.  However, the following word order is also correct: \\n >\u6211\u5f88\u9ad8\u5174\u5e94\u4e3a\u6211\u6536\u5230\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u793c\u7269\u4eceProfessorson\u6559\u6388\u3002 \\n >I very happy because I received a gift from Professorson professor. \\n Now as you can see, if we just added an \"am\" after the \"I\" and put the \"professor\" in front of the guy\\'s name, the second sentence is correct english.  The first sentence, if you also add some strategic commas, is also correct english, it just sounds a bit strange.  However, in neither case does the sentence sound \"backwards\". \\n In the sentence we used here, there was no semantic complexity, all the words are commonplace and mundane and can be translated into direct equivalents.  And as for the grammar, as you can see chinese grammar is not that different from english.  For the most part, chinese has Subject Verb Object sentence word order.  I believe japanese is SOV. \\n In the article you linked to the TED site, most of the examples have to do with semantic content of words.  Certain languages have certain words that mean a certain shade of meaning that other languages don\\'t have, or some languages use certain words more than others, or certain concepts are embedded into certain phrases, and so that influences thought.  It\\'s kind of like \"eskimos have 500 words for snow\" (this example probably not actually true but that\\'s the idea).  Only one example is actually about the grammar of the language, which is the example about people who happen to speak a \"futureless languages\" saving more, I would question the accuracy of that statement.  There\\'s no way to separate correlation from causation on that fact.  It could be a causal effect from language to thought to action, but I think it\\'s more likely to be a completely incidental fact that has nothing to do with anything. \\n Anyways, getting back to our sentence with professor proffessorson.  As you can see from my analysis, grammar and form differences between english and chinese are vastly overblown.  I can\\'t possibly how you could look at \"I very happy because I from Professorson professor received a gift\" and conclude that chinese people think in some sort of \"circular\" manner. \\n As for your example with Japanese, I see SOV order and I see a lot of honorifics (both of which btw are lacking in chinese).  However, other than the honorifics and the word order I\\'m still not sure what you mean by \"asian (or at least japanese at any rate) people speak, and therefore think, \\'backwards\\' or \"circular;\\' \".  In what way is it backwards or circular?  Tell me exactly what sorts of substantial effects on thought that grammatical quirks have.  Do you see any of this \"backwardness\" or \"circularity\" in the international student\\'s essay? \\n (Your annotated paragraph is slightly difficult to follow, perhaps you can write it in literally translated japanese ordered english similar to what I did with chinese?) \\n I agree that, in theory, language can have an effect on thought.  However, you\\'re saying that it\\'s not just the language, but the form of the language, the very sentence structure and phrase structure that makes a big difference.', 'since we\\'re doing literary analysis, might as well break out some counter-criticism right? \\n >The reasons for this coding system (whether it\u2019s intentional or not) seem obvious\u2014doggy-style sex is, visually, all about power\u2014one figure (male) \u201ctaking\u201d another (female). Several excellent articles have talked about how Game of Thrones manages all sex as an expression of power on behalf of the female characters, but the immediate visual cue is one of no intimacy, love, or pleasure for the receiving partner. \\n >The code is clear: doggy-style is rape-y, domineering, sexist. But the purity of face-to-face sex is so great that it can turn a brutish rapist into a loving husband. Babies are born from gazing into each other\u2019s eyes. \\n the above quotes seem to be the thesis of the article.  the author is exploring the usage of the trope \"doggystyle/blowjob implies dispassionate dominance by the male partner\" in game of thrones, establishing that the trope is usually played straight throughout game of thrones.  she also seems to be refuting the idea that \"Game of Thrones manages all sex as an expression of power on behalf of the female characters\", insisting that the truth is actually usually more to the contrary, but with some important exceptions critical to plot and character development. \\n if the trope is played straight, which is indeed the usual case in game of thrones, the male partner is dominant and gives the impression of \"using the girl for just sex\".  the code for this is doggy style sex, and fallatio.  but sometimes, every once in a while, you\\'ve got loving, intimate sex and the code for that is face-to-face sex of various sorts.  in the second you can argue that the trope is still played straight since it\\'s just a contrapositive of the original formulation.  (for those of you who don\\'t know what I\\'m talking about, what I\\'m saying is that \"NOT doggystyle/blowjob implies NOT dispassionate dominance by the male partner\" is logically equivalent to \"doggystyle/blowjob implies dispassionate dominance by the male partner\".  take a course in formal logic muthafuckas) \\n the basic thesis i can agree with, but lots of the evidence the author uses is flawed.  for example, as someone else pointed out, the scene between jamie and cersei is much more complicated than \"jamie is a beast, he likes transgressive sex, fucks his sister from behind, and pushes kids out of windows with no qualms\".  this is definitely the impression that is given, no doubt about that.  but if you\\'ve read the books, you\\'ll learn there\\'s so much more to jamie\\'s character, and make no mistake there IS intimacy between them at that point in time, it was not a dispassionate affair from jamie\\'s end.  so this is an instance where the trope is kind of played with and then neutralized.  now that i think of it, i think it\\'s done pretty well.  big props to the writers for literary skill in this scene (although, as someone pointed out, the decision to make the sex be doggy style was probably more due to practical considerations.  but if so, then it worked out just right) \\n also, consider the following quote: \\n >Doggy style seems to be part of a larger sexual coding in this universe. Transgressive sex\u2014an extremely wide category in this case that includes sex with prostitutes, sibling incest, rape, pseudo-lesbian sex lessons\u2014happens in the form of doggy style. \\n again, the basic idea seems alright, but the author did a bad job of screening her textual evidence... \\n the \"pseudo lesbian sex lessons\", if i recall correctly, did not involve any doggy style.  in fact, the whole point of that sex lesson was doreah trying to teach daenerys how not to have sex doggy style.  they were face to face the whole time.  also, the \"pseudo lesbian sex lessons\" in littlefinger\\'s brothel also involved only face-to-face. \\n the only time i remember seeing a blowjob was that gay scene between renly and loras.  even if one of them was a female, i don\\'t think this thesis would apply to this case.  it\\'d be one of the exceptions to the \"doggystyle/blowjob -> dispassionate dominance\" trope. \\n so', 'I actually  would  call absurdism and existentialism ethical theories.  explicitly, they don\\'t seem to be but i would argue that at the core absurdism/existentialism are indeed about ethics. \\n existentialism is about Man choosing his own meaning, to put it in a very simple and general way.  absurdism is basically the same, although do note i am skipping over lots and lots of finer points here. \\n now, \"meaning\" and \"values\" are two different words, but I would argue that in this context, the two refer to the same thing.  you see, when you think about it, all human actions serve human values.  if a man is choosing his own meaning in life, he is also choosing his own values.  if you choose to value something, you are choosing to imbue it with meaning.  in this context, there is no actual difference between \"meaning\" and \"value\", and the two words are really interchangeable \\n and \"values\" of course, is more or less synonymous with \"ethics\".  so, existentialism and absurdism are really just ethical theories in disguise.  to put it in ethics terms, existentialism says that the universe is devoid of inherent value, and inherently devoid of any rules of conduct and what not, and so we humans shall choose our own values, and  \"artificially\"  imbue value into our actions. \\n EDIT: I guess I\\'ll slightly add some more to the above for clarity.  Absurdism and existentialism are ethical theories which say that man should, and does, choose whatever ethical theories he finds most satisfying.  So in one sense, it\\'s not an  really  ethical theory but more of descriptive theory (because of the \"and does\" part of the previous sentence).  but still, when ethics is discussed, absurdism and existentialism are most certainly not irrelevant. \\n not only is The Comedian an absurd hero, we may be able to also argue that Dr. Manhattan is as well.  I\\'m not too sure about Dr. Manhattan, however, because the first criteria for an absurd hero is that the hero knows that the universe is absurd.  I\\'m not too familiar with The Watchmen, so I don\\'t know what Manhattan\\'s stance is on this, but since Manhattan is almost all powerful and all knowing, it would make sense that he is, and yet at the same time, he still decides to help humans sometimes, and he still strives.  instead of just going off to bask in his god-ness, at the end of the movie he goes off to Mars, to try to make a new life form if i\\'m not mistaken.  that shows that even though he\\'s lost hope for man, he hasn\\'t lost all hope, and he continues to push that rock up the hill. \\n my arguement on dr. Manhattan being an absurd hero is a bit shaky, but the Comedian probably is without much doubt. \\n but anyways, that\\'s not my main point, my main point is that:', 'Why do you insist on contradicting yourself?  First you say, \"reality is subjective\".  Then you say \"You\\'ll never see objective reality, only interpretations\".  The second statement implies that objective reality actually exists, reality itself is objective, it\\'s just that we never experience it directly, we have to interpret it through our limited fleshy means, and our interpretation is imperfect.  So which is it gonna be, is underlying reality objective or subjective?  Do we share the same world or do we each somehow generate our own world?  If it is the second, then what happens when two worlds interact?  I somehow doubt you\\'re actually suggesting the second option, you\\'re just using the phrase \"reality is subjective\" as a rhetorical hook. \\n And again, as I said in my last post, if your answer is that reality is objective (our imperfect perceptions of it notwithstanding), then that means that some interpretations are better than others.  An interpretation which happens to land closer to the way reality actually is, is better than an interpretation that is farther off.  If hypothetically we agree that we have the right to be hostile towards people who are wrong (not say that we should, just hypothetically), then the people with the better interpretation clearly have the right to be hostile to the ones with the inferior interpretation.  Putting aside this throwaway hypothetical example, the point is that if underlying reality is objective then the statement \"there\\'s one way to see the world\" is theoretically true, merely that in practice we can never actually reach that One Way. \\n Your second paragraph I find to be more or less consistent, including the strange anthropomorphizing of reality itself.  It did occur to me that aesthetic and ethical judgement were value judgement, not judgement of objective reality.  However, when you say the word \"reality\", we\\'re generally referring to objective reality are we not?  As in, \"None of us live in the same reality as the other\".  If we take that statement at face value, that means we\\'re living in literally different worlds, like we don\\'t even share the same world. \\n This division of factual judgement and value judgments is called \"Hume\\'s Guillotine\" by philosophers.  Statements of \"is\" have nothing to do with statements of \"ought\", and vice versa.  Another way that some philosophers put it is that factual statements are statements about how the world is, wheras value statements are statements about how we desire the world to be. \\n However, some philosophers argue that if you accept Hume\\'s Guillotine, then that leads to moral nihilism.  Basically, we have certain ways to approximately find out what \"Is\", for example you could use your senses to determine which statements of fact are true and which statements of fact are false.  But what ways have we to find out what \"Ought\"?  Do we have some magical ethical sense?  Are we magically born with knowledge of ethics?  And even if we did have some magic ethical sense, what exactly are we sensing?  Our eyes sense light, which gives us information about the world.  Does our magical ethical sense give us information about some Platonic realm of morals?  Are there laws inscribed into the fabric of the cosmos that our magical ethical sense or knowledge gives us access to?', 'I didn\\'t think of that, this is a very good point, \\n however, I still insist that since an author writes a story to express himself, we still have a kind of responsibility as readers to try to understand what the author\\'s meaning was, before creating and instilling our own meanings. \\n isn\\'t literary criticism all about attempting to figure out what a story is \"trying to say\"?  notice how i say \"story\" instead of \"author\".  which just means that, yes, I agree with you in that what the meaning that the  story  is trying to express can be somewhat divorced from what the  author  was trying to say.  but nevertheless, the author is the one who wrote the story.  even if you disagree with my assertion that us readers have an obligation to try to understand the author\\'s message, it is still impossible to separate the story and the author completely, and to understand the former, it is always very insightful to understand the latter.  I strongly hold that this \"can of worms\" that you refer to in your last paragraph is an integral and fundamental element to literature, though not the only element. \\n because come on, face it, the author embeds his mental dna into his story when he writes it, the story is born from the author\\'s head like athena from that of zeus.  and no, the story is not a thinking being which has a mind of it\\'s own like athena is.  the \"mind\" of the story is a piece of work which is a fragment of, and woven from, the author\\'s own mind, forged from the fires of his psyche.  I will not say that this piece of work is completely static, but it\\'s certainly not dynamic like athena.  if it grows, it will grow like stalactite, or a crystal, and not like an organic being. \\n as nerdysweet said, it is difficult to prove what the author\\'s intention was.  but if you think this is difficult, then how difficult do you think it is to prove what the \"true\" meaning of the story is?  You can\\'t prove what the author\\'s intention was, but the author certainly did have somewhat of an intention, and what the author\\'s intention was is an objective fact.  it either was his intention, or it wasn\\'t.  we probably will have a difficult time determining which is which, but it\\'s theoretically possible.  but how is the \"true meaning of the story\" in anyway objective?  how is it even theoretically possible to determine the \"true\" meaning of the story?  it\\'s now just a matter of subjective interpretation, and on what your criteria for \"true meaning\" is.  I suppose now, it\\'s just a matter of, \"what did I \\'take\\' from the story?\"  and, \"what will most people \\'take\\' from the story upon reading it?\"', 'Yes, this.  Even with the minimalistic dialog and plot, characterization is rich and nuanced in a souls game.  Morality in DS, just as in real life, cannot be pigeon-holed.  As far as \"alignment\" systems go, the DnD system is relatively complex, but it by far fails to account for the full breadth of human motivation and capture the full complexity of what we value and desire. \\n Besides, you can go into all sorts of discussion about what \"good and evil\" really means.  Is selfishness evil or just neutral?  If you kill people to save people, is that good or neutral?  If you\\'re motivated to do horrible things for the sake of love (as is implied for Lautrec, who wears armour that has the arms of the love goddess embracing him) is that evil?  Is the illusions and pretense that Gwyndolin is putting up in Anor Londo, what with trying to trick the PC into temporarily extending the age of fire (see that one lore video by Epic Name Bro) good or evil?  You could say it\\'s evil because it\\'s manipulating others to make huge sacrifices for something that\\'s really ultimately futile, the Age of Fire will burn out eventually one way or the other, even if you do link the fires.  But on the flip side, you could say it\\'s good because the Age of Fire seems to be a happy Age for most, and Age of Darkness/Humanity sounds, well, rather ominous. \\n And as for the law/chaos, what if you disregard society\\'s laws but you have a strict-ish code of your own, is that law or chaos?', 'I would say that a Value is an end, a desired outcome, usually sort of abstract or general in character.  An action or an \" instrumental  value\" (ie a subordinate goal) that helps to achieve a particular value can be said to be in accordance to that value. \\n In other words, a value is a [Normative Statement]( a statement of how something OUGHT to be.  Well, I guess I should qualify the previous statement and say that a value is generally speaking a  general or abstract  normative statement, and not a \"run of the mill\" normative statement.  We generally don\\'t consider the statement, \"the moon ought to be made of green cheese\" as a value, although we could. \\n A \"Morality\" is basically a system of values.  A morality will choose some values over others, and make the claim the some values are more important than some other values.  Remember, just because it\\'s a value doesn\\'t necessarily means that it\\'s worth actually valuing.  This is why it still makes sense to consider the sillier, more mundane, and oddly specific normative statements to be values. \\n A Morality will inevitably have two kinds of values, intrinsic values and instrumental values.  Intrinsic values are values which are considered to be a \"greatest good\" of sorts.  The value itself is good, in fact intrinsic values basically  define  what is \"good\".  Instrumental values are only valued so far as they bring about the intrinsic values.  Instrumental values are ends that are themselves means to a greater end.  This means you can have a whole networked chain of instrumental value hanging off of an intrinsic value, so to speak.']": "Based on the reddit posting history, it seems that the user is interested in topics related to language, linguistics, translation, and literary analysis.", "[\"I have a similar issue.

Basically, I'm guess that you view yourself as unworthy and inexperienced in the dating world. \\n The unworthy part can be low self esteem, which might be all in your head or it could be that you're not feeling fulfilled in life.  Low self esteem is relatively easy to fix, lack of fulfillment takes some real life changes.  For low self esteem, you pretty much just have to start not giving a shit.  I don't mean to say stop taking care of your appearance or being disrespectful, but there's always gonna be someone who doesn't like you for one reason or another.  You've got to accept that and not see it as anything personal, because it's not.  It's a bit of a fake it till you make it thing, but a more accurate phrasing would be 'fake it till it's real.'  Change your posture, start standing upright and keep your eyes at head level when you're walking around.

You might have a shit job or just be unhappy with the direction you're going.  This might take some serious life changes but it could also be as simple as finding a new hobby or passion.  Most people don't like their jobs so that won't really count against you in the dating world, as long as that resentment doesn't carry over into other parts of your life.  That's why a hobby or passion is so important.  It doesn't really matter what it is, just as long as you're doing it simply because you enjoy doing it.  Everyone likes someone with a passion, you'll be more attractive to others and feel more fulfilled in life.  That happiness and satisfaction will definitely make you 'play the mating game' a lot better. \\n The inexperience thing is easy and hard to work on at exactly the same time.

When you're out at a bar or at a party, make a point of approaching at least one woman you haven't met.  9/10 times you'll be shot down, that's to be expected.  Try to implement what you've learned by reading and what you've learned through trial and error.  It should be casual though so don't force anything that you're not comfortable with.  That being said, the only way to expand your comfort zone is to step out of it every now and then.  After the night is over, take some time to reflect on why things went the way they did.  Maybe you hesitated when you shouldn't have, maybe you talked about yourself a little too much, maybe you focused on your appearance.  One of the most important things though is  why  you approached that person.  Don't pick someone at random, make sure it's someone you're actually attracted to for one reason or another.  Try, fail, learn, repeat until successful. \\n Also appearances make a pretty big difference.  Care about how you look, take time to pick clothes that fit and that you like.

I think this is called cold welding and, if memory serves, is why tools that astronauts use have a thing plastic coating. \\n Edit: typos \\n Edit 2: \\n After staring at my lava lamp for a bit I think surface tension and differences in density are  not  the primary reason for blobs bouncing off each other, though they do play a role.  When blobs collide there is a thin layer of water between them so they don't actually touch.  This is why they can sit at the top and not merge right away.  After they've been siting at the top for while, the water layer has been pushed to the side as the blobs are still being pushed upwards by their lower density.  (I know I'm not using 'push' in the technically correct way, don't get your panties in a bunch.)  Once that water layer has been pushed aside in at least one local spot between the blobs, they start to merge  and then  surface tension takes over, making it seem like they merge instantly.  Surface tension wants the blobs to be as spherical as possible and once they've made first contact that happens quickly. \\n I don't think differences in density are as big a factor as the thin separating layer.  Consider that when a large amount of wax has formed at the top, in a single blob, it doesn't always drop down all at once.  Sometimes a portion of it will 'drip' off of the rest.  This means that there are differing levels of density across the big blob.  It is possible that blobs can only merge when density differences are within a certain spectrum.  I'm not a thermodynamics guy but based on the speed the blobs move while in the lava lamp I don't think the differences in density (of wax blobs) are very high to begin with.\", 'This isn\\'t really a question for SE but I think I can help. \\n Preventative measures are much better than actually dealing with the cops so talking to your neighbors is a great idea.  Try to give them a couple day\\'s heads up and emphasize that you don\\'t want to be a nuisance to them.  Make it clear that you\\'ll respond to their requests, this will likely give you more leeway as far as noise goes because they\\'ll feel more respected already.  If they do call though you  must  respond in kind.  If they call and ask you to turn it down but you don\\'t, there go all of your partying privileges and you\\'ll probably see the cops soon. \\n You should be able to police your own party.  You can have fun but don\\'t get plastered, if things start to get out of hand you will be responsible for bringing everything back together.  If your neighbors do call, they\\'re not going to respond well to a drunk and the cops certainly will react unfavorably. \\n If the cops want to bust you, they will and there\\'s very little you can do about it.  The thing is that it\\'s a lot of work for them and often a big headache, usually more trouble than it\\'s worth.  If however you piss them off or rub them the wrong way, you might be going downtown.  Sometimes college town cops start out very aggressive because they\\'re used to dealing with drunk assholes.  If that\\'s the case, stay calm and point out that you\\'re being civil and respectful.  They\\'ll likely match your tone and will be very appreciative that you\\'re not another drunk asshole. \\n Dealing with the cops is always tricky so it\\'s best to avoid that all together.  If they show up, be courteous and respectful but don\\'t volunteer any information.  \"Hello officer, what can I do for you?\"  \"Yes, I have a few friends over.\"  \"Oh ok, I\\'ll keep the noise down, is that all?\"  \"Have a good night.\" \\n If they come to the door you should answer.  Make sure people in the house know that cops are there, this way there\\'ll be fewer background shenanigans which could count as probable cause, and you\\'ll be able to have a better conversation.  If you have an outer door and an inner door, like a screen vs wooden door, only open the inner one.  When the entrance to your house is closed they need legal justification to come inside.  However you should also balance how much of your house the cops can see, the less the better so it might be preferable to step outside and close the door behind you.  Along those lines, all pot smoking should be done out of sight.  If they see any smoking paraphernalia then that\\'s probable cause to search your home.  That\\'s true too if they smell it though, unless it\\'s overpowering, generally college town cops won\\'t bust you for that if you\\'re being respectful. \\n If they ask to enter the house then politely say no, the fact that they\\'re asking means that they need your permission.  Something like \\'I\\'m sorry but no, tonight is invite only\\' might be good as it lightens the mood.  If they ask if everyone in the house is of age then of course say yes.  If they ask to see your ID then you should ask if you are being detained.  If you are not being detained then you can decline to show them your ID.  Take their warnings seriously, they do not want to come back any more than you want them to, the difference is that they can vent their frustration via writing tickets. \\n edit:  As several others have pointed out, it might be better to just provide your ID.  As fucked up as it is, exercising your rights does arouse suspicion.  If you\\'re underage then it\\'s definitely worth a shot to decline showing your ID, otherwise it might be the safer option. \\n If you or anyone at your house are underage then you\\'re going to have to be extra careful.  If you\\'re in a college town then the cops probably won\\'t bust you if you\\'re respectful and reasonable but it\\'s better not to take chances.  Providing alcohol to minors is a pretty heavy charge.', 'There\\'s a great book about this, How to Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie.  It\\'s full of simple and seemingly obvious stuff but is explained in a way that makes things easier to actually do.  I recommend reading it, but [here\\'s the audio book on youtube]( \\n I think I\\'m a good conversationalist, partially because my family moved often when I was younger and I had to learn to make friends quickly, and partially because I made an active effort to learn how to [schmooze]( with anybody.  I\\'m not sure exactly how you\\'re going about things in a conversation, but here is what I\\'ve found to work. \\n If you can get someone to talk to you about their passions they\\'ll think you\\'re the most interesting person in the world, even if you haven\\'t shared anything about your own passions.  People absolutely love to talk about themselves, there are very few exceptions to this.  The trick is to find out what they are passionate about, get them talking about it, and be  genuinely  interested. \\n Are they wearing a shirt with a sports logo?  Does their clothing indicate a hobby?  What does their tattoo mean?  Look for hints as to what they care about. \\n People can tell when you\\'re just talking for the sake of talking, or if you\\'re just waiting for your own turn to speak.  That turns people away very quickly, so you have to  actually be interested  in what they are talking about.  It\\'s one of those fake it till it\\'s real things, you have to cultivate curiosity about other people.  Everyone has something interesting about them and if you  invite  them to talk about it then they\\'ll happily tell you. \\n The thing is that you must actually be interested and put any ulterior motives you have on hold.  If you are actually interested then things will just fall into place, you\\'ll be asking good questions, have a friendly posture, maintaining good eye contact, etc.  Be interested in  them  and they will think that  you  are interesting. \\n Also, SMILE!  When you meet someone, smile!  Be happy you\\'re meeting them, make that clear and unambiguous, but don\\'t overdo it of course.  Those first 10 seconds of meeting someone are key, that\\'s when we form most of our opinions about that person.  A solid handshake, a genuine smile, eye contact, and get their name. Which brings me to: \\n \"A person\\'s name is the sweetest and most beautiful sound in any language.\"  That\\'s directly from the book I mentioned,  remember names.   When you get their name, repeat it aloud while looking them in the eye, repeat it in your mind a couple times too.  If it\\'s natural to use their name in conversation then do so, if there are other people around be sure to use all of their names. \\n All of this relates to one big theme, you have to be happy that you\\'re spending time with this person.  Sometimes you have to lie to yourself about it until it\\'s true, but if you do that well enough then you\\'ll believe it.  It\\'s not as simple as repeating \\'this person is cool\\' in your mind, that probably won\\'t work.  Try to connect what they\\'re talking about to something in your life, whether that\\'s a passion of your or just something you\\'re curious about.  Your body language also affects how you\\'re thinking and feeling, it\\'s not just a reflection of what you are thinking or feeling.  Lean towards them when sitting down, face the person directly, look them in the eyes, etc.  This takes practice, so pay attention to how you interact and also pay attention to how other people interact. \\n It\\'s not about being interesting, having cool hobbies, unique passions, or exotic experiences, none of that means jack shit [if you\\'re just going to talk about yourself]( the whole time.  It\\'s about caring what the other person has to say.', 'Hey I wrote a paper about this!  Well actually I was arguing for why we should start work on colonizing Mars tomorrow, but there\\'s a section directly relevant to your question. \\n >\"The first step in considering ecosynthesis on Mars is the delineation of the requirements for habitability. We tend to think of the present Earth as the only model for a habitable world. However, there are two alternative possibilities for life supporting states for Mars, one with oxygen and one without.\" \\n >An oxygenic environment would obviously be preferable for human habitation but a low oxygen environment would also allow for decently comfortable living.  A primarily carbon dioxide atmosphere, with moderate levels of nitrogen and low levels of oxygen, likely prevailed on earth approximately two billion years ago.  \u201cMany bacteria, some plants and even a few animals can survive in low oxygen atmospheres.\u201d Humans would require supplemental oxygen but these could be provided through oxygen masks or the greenhouse domes described above.  As long as there is life on the planet, agriculture is possible, thus a self sustaining human colony is also possible. \\n >Yet the current Martian climate is a terribly inhospitable place, the atmospheric pressure is less than one hundredth of that on Earth and the temperatures are hundreds of degrees colder.   If we are to revive a Martian biosphere, the atmosphere must be thickened and warmed.  Thankfully almost all of the material needed to increase the atmosphere is already frozen on the Martian surface.  While exact figures are not yet known, large carbon dioxide deposits are frozen near the Martian poles.  CO2 is a greenhouse gas, once those frozen deposits are thawed they will create a runaway greenhouse effect that should warm up the entire planet.  Water ice, trapped nitrogen, and pockets of oxygen will all melt and evaporate and contribute to global warming. \\n >The simplest plan to begin the polar melting comes straight out of science fiction: giant space mirrors.  While these could not be constructed on Earth, orbital construction could easily handle the task and is indeed a precursor of any human space habitation.  These mirrors would not be in orbit around the planet because they need to remain stationary over the poles.  Instead they would be strategically placed so that the pressure from solar wind and Martian gravity would balance out.  Reflecting extra sunlight directly onto the poles would quickly warm them and kick start a runaway greenhouse effect. \\n >Eventually, once a minimum habitable environment has been achieved, life can be introduced.  This would be the final step of the terraforming process.  The biosphere on Earth is the way it is today only after millenia of climate-altering life forms.  Oxygen was synthesized by plants and microbes and the biomass in the soil comes from dead life forms.  The Earth itself was terraformed by life, even though there was no intelligent direction behind it.  This same process could be reproduced on Mars except with much greater efficiency. \\n >It is difficult to know exactly how long this process would take, much of it is still very hypothetical.  However some reasonable estimates can be made.  After a runaway greenhouse effect is started, it may take as little as a century before simple life forms can be introduced.  However for full ecosynthesis, to a near-Earth-like environment, could take as long as 100,000 years. These estimates do not necessarily take into account paradigm shifting scientific advances though it is clear that they are just a best guess.  A range of 100 to 100,000 is not very useful. \\n >However, we can be sure that the processes which led to Mars\u2019s current climate would not hamper terraforming efforts.  McKay estimates that once a life-supporting environment is created, it would last for at least 10 million years.  This is actually quite close to the estimates on how much longer the Earth will remain habitable (barring continued human caused environmental destruction). At the very least we can be sure that a terraformed Mars would not have a short lived habitable climate.', \"First you should forget all of your ethical principles and start from scratch.  Ultimately our ethical principles decide our politics and more often than not the principles we hold to are the ones that were passed down to us.  More often than not they are well intentioned but misinformed.  Most people want to do the write thing, ethics are something most people believe they understand even if they have never made an effort to study them.  Thankfully it's not that hard to get a cursory understanding of a variety of ethical principles, you don't need a degree in ethics to appreciate the values of different ethical systems.  Read over the [wikipedia ethics page]( and further explore the ones that most appeal to you.  Utilitarianism is a great place to start even though it has its flaws. \\n Then expand your political horizons.  Learn as much as you can about political ideologies that are radically different from your own.  Anarchism, fascism, socialism, capitalism, liberal democracy, parliamentary government, etc.  Each has its benefits and its drawbacks.  There is no perfect system, ultimately the choice comes down to which set of problems you are most willing to deal with. \\n Try to maintain an open mind, you should be able to entertain an idea as though you believed it was true even if you do not.  For example, when examining fascism you should base your examination on the premise that national unity is paramount above all else.  Fascism was not a dirty word until WWII, it was just another political ideology, so when learning and thinking about fascism it's important to push aside preconceptions. \\n When learning about political ideologies you also need to familiarize yourself with the social, political, and economic critiques and analysis that they offer.  That includes factual research.  There's a ton on information available on the net in easily digestible forms but you'll need to watch out for those with a specific agenda to confuse or misinform.  Sometimes that kind of misinformation is not intentional.  This is most visible when talking about leftist ideologies.  For example, socialism has become a dirty word in the USA.  Its meaning and definition do not at all match the colloquial perception of it yet the basic underlying principle is quite simple.  Instead of a boss who decides things for the employees, the employees elect a manager and collectively make business decisions themselves.  That's socialism in a nutshell but there are countless different forms of socialism. \\n Remember that every state institution (not state as in Colorado, the State as a political entity) has a vested interest in promoting and justifying its own existence.  Sometimes this is good, more often than not it is bad.  As you learn and think about politics you must be very wary because the loudest and most easily heard voices are those that are most likely to deceive you. \\n Once you've got some ethical principles that you believe are worth believing then you can compare them to the ideologies you have learned about.  For example, if you believe individual liberty is paramount then anarchism might be for you.  If you believe that most people are not competent to make political decisions themselves then liberal democracy might be for you. Sometimes compromises must be made.  For example do you want to promote liberty or security?  These are often at odds though a balance can be found. \\n After you've settled on the political ideology that seems best you absolutely must learn the strongest arguments against what you believe.  Political and ethical positions are only as strong as their ability to withstand the harshest criticism.  If your beliefs can withstand the strongest arguments against them then you're done.  You've found your own political platform and you are most able to defend it against those who would challenge what you believe.\", \"Yes, it certainly is.  The racial component alone is huge, [every 28 hours a black man is killed by cops, security guards, or Zimmerman type vigilantes.](  In Ferguson, there are [more arrest warrants issued every year than there are people.](  There is almost zero accountability, even in the most [horrific cases](  The racism within police departments is so prevalent that they sometimes [try to kill black police officers]( and there are still zero repercussions.  Every time a police officer gets away with killing someone it sends a message to all other cops: you can get away with it too. \\n The prison industrial complex is enormous as well, and the arrests of people of color are astoundingly prevalent.  The USA has ~2.3 million prisoners, most of whom are black.  We have more prisoners than China, a full 25% of the world's total prison population lives in US prisons.  Prisoners are exploited as a source of cheap labor since the 13th amendment [allows forced labor (slavery) for those convicted of a crime.](  This has been [explicitly admitted]( by government agencies.  Many US corporations contract with prisons for cheap labor.  [More black men are in prison today than there were slaves in 1850.](  It is true that the US population today is much larger but this still indicates the scale of the problem.  [One in three black men will be sent to prison]( at some point during their lives. \\n Stepping beyond the racial aspect, there are [over 80,000 SWAT team raids per year]( most of these are for arrest warrants, drugs, and/or illegal gambling.  These raids are [fucking terrifying for families]( and the cops seem to have zero compunction about injuring or killing innocents.  There was no indictment for the cops who [threw a flashbang into a baby's crib]( and the state is refusing to pay medical bills.  All of this is happening while police departments are being [given military weapons and vehicles]( at an alarming rate.  The cops who use these weapons and vehicles have almost zero training on how to use them.  They are told that they are warriors in the war on crime or the war on drugs, the implication there is that [civilians are the enemy.]( \\n The attitudes that cops have about all of this are terrifying, [here's an infographic]( that gives a decent summary.  They believe that you should do what they say no matter what, and if you don't then [it's your own fault if they shoot you.]( \\n [The US crime rate is at an historic low but killings by cops are continuing to rise.](  In Utah, [homicide committed by cops outnumbers all other types of homicide.](  Cops are even [killing children]( who are only [holding toys]( It seems like the first thing they reach for is their gun when it is [absolutely clear that they could have used a tazer or pepper spray.](  This problem is probably a lot worse than we know, since we don't have accurate numbers as [how many people cops kill every year.]( \\n Another twist on all of this is [civil asset forfeiture]( which is essentially legalized robbery by the cops.  They can take your property from you without charging you with any crime, and they often have direct financial gain from what they steal from you.  The cops have [zero illusions about what they are doing]( they know it is robbery and they do not seem to care.  Cops literally have a financial incentive to beat and rob you. \\n Certainly not all cops are violent thugs, but the so called good cops do not speak up or intervene when another cop is attacking someone.  The few whistle blowers that exist are [treated horribly]( and receive no protection from the government.  I'm having trouble finding it now, but there is a story about a cop who lodged complaints about other officers' use of force.  Later he and others responded to a call of a violent suspect with a knife.  This officer tackled the man instead of shooting him, ended up wrestling this violent person who was trying to stab the officer, while his fellow cops stood to the side and watched.  The [Blue Code of Silence]( is astoundingly powerful, with all the [backlash cops receive from other cops]( it should be no surprise how few come forward about crimes committed by fellow officers.\"]": "Based on the user's reddit posting history, it appears that the user is interested in the following areas:\n\n1.

It's not an OS problem, it's not an Apple problem, and it isn't a password reset problem. The whole point of encryption is to make this impossible. \\n Even if OSX and all other operating systems prevented password reset, it wouldn't mean anything. Your files are just sitting there, access is only blocked by software. A thief in your scenario could just connect your harddisk to his own computer and see your files just as easily without any password whatsoever (in fact this is most likely what they would do instead of murking with terminal to do a password reset if they were after your data). So preventing password resets would give you a false sense of security at best. \\n If you don't want this to happen, your  only  choice is to use encryption. There simply is no other way (this is the case with ALL operating systems), and as we all know, encryption has its downsides. So it is you that should weigh the cons and pros of using encryption on case by case basis. \\n In other words, if your files are siting in a drive unencrypted,  no amount of software barriers can prevent access to your data if someone has physical access to your computer .

Instead, the system works with several different canvases, but these canvases support transparency. The image you see on your screen is the superimposition (is this a word?) of all those different canvases. The mouse cursor is just another layer. \\n When you take a screenshot, the system does not literally copy the full superimposed image to your clipboard (the OS might not have convenient access to all the pixels shown on your screen, because some layers are handled by the GPU directly); in this case, it takes everything  but  the mouse cursor layer. All this compositing is typically done by GPUs in modern operating systems. \\n Now the implementation differs across operating systems. It might be this way for usability reasons, or maybe, in some cases, it might be just easier to get the layers except the mouse cursor (for example, when the mouse cursor is hardware accelerated, the OS defers the whole job to your graphics card and its driver; so the OS might have no idea what appears under cursor position unless it asks the graphics driver for the whole buffer that is drawn to screen). \\n You might also observe missing elements in your screenshots when you  try to copy images of running videos on your screen; since they are usually fully hardware accelerated, even if you have image in the movie window, it might come up blank, or filled with a solid color. Again in this case, for performance reasons, the OS just gives the data to your GPU, and it does the decoding and direct screen rendering; so the OS (taking the screenshot) has no idea what the exact pixel values in the window are as all the decoding and rendering is handled by the GPU so they are not visible to the OS unless it asks for it. \\n I\\'m not sure if this is supported in new Windows systems, but in Mac OSX, you can take screenshots of individual windows.

So they kick in at different times. I didn't look at your results it in detail, but the one with the higher threshold should leak a bit of the attack to the output signal because, well, it triggers later. (BTW, your attack will  always  leak a bit, unless you are using a look-ahead compressor. How much will it leak? That depends on your threshold, which is different in your compressors) \\n This part of the question doesn't make any sense: \\n >is the attack time how long the compressor takes before it starts compressing \\n This can't happen. If that was the case, we would need another whole new parameter for the compressor: ok, attack controls when the compressor starts compressing (after exceeding threshold), but how do we control how fast the compressor attains full compression once it starts? Instantly? That wouldn't work, it would just create an audible clicking noise. So how many (milli)seconds?  You'll need a new parameter! . \\n NO compressor, plug in, digital rack, or full analog, works this way (and I've used many, many plugins, and I've had the chance to actually work in world class recording/mastering studios). I have designed and programmed compressors. You control  when  the compressor will kick in with the  threshold  parameter. Compressor starts kicking in in the exact moment signal passes the threshold  by definition . Then your  attack  defines how fast the compressor will attain full compression. Your release time will define how fast the signal will start playing in full / original volume  after  the signal goes below your threshold parameter. \\n Some compressors allow you to modify the compression slope though (linear, exp, log etc.) and with those your slope might look like, the compressor is kicking in after waiting a bit after the threshold passes. This would be the case for exponential slopes for example. After the threshold, you'd see little activity in gain reduction, but it will get faster and faster. It might make you believe that the compressor is waiting an additional amount of time after passing threshold, but actually it is just working on its slope shape.\", 'Open source\" basically means, you have access to  reading  the code.

The rough guide used by most 35 mm photographers is that the slowest shutter speed that can be used easily without much blur due to camera shake is the shutter speed numerically closest to the lens focal length. For example, for handheld use of a 35 mm camera with a 50 mm normal lens, the closest shutter speed is 1/60 s. This rule can be augmented with knowledge of the intended application for the photograph, an image intended for significant enlargement and closeup viewing would require faster shutter speeds to avoid obvious blur. Through practice and special techniques such as bracing the camera, arms, or body to minimize camera movement longer shutter speeds can be used without blur. If a shutter speed is too slow for hand holding, a camera support, usually a tripod, must be used. Image stabilization can often permit the use of shutter speeds 3\u20134 stops slower (exposures 8\u201316 times longer).', 'Excellent lighting, great subjects, and hella post-processing all go into making these shots what they are. A reasonable implementation of the Dragan technique could get you close enough to be happy. There are even [free lightroom actions]( for that. \\n You unfortunately stumbled into a bit of a quagmire - asking /r/photography how to Dragan is an unwritten faux paus in these parts.

And nobody finds the old ones before posting theirs, because you don\\'t know the term to look for in the first place, and even if you did all of the previous threads are just called \"how do i make photos that look like this?\" \\n Two places I would suggest you look for more information are the weekly /r/photography question thread, and cross-posting this thread to /r/photoit (or potentially /r/postprocessing).', 'Besides  always  keeping your finger off the trigger until the moment you are ready to pull it, there are only a few other biggies: \\n \\n Don\\'t ever point a gun at something you don\\'t intend to destroy, EVER. Pointing a gun at something/someone is tantamount to saying \"it would be fine for me if I killed you right now.\" This applies even when you know a gun is not loaded (see next rule) \\n \\n Every gun is loaded. Always. Even with no magazine,  and the chamber open / slide back / whatever, showing you there are zero bullets in there, treat it like it\\'s loaded, always. That means you still follow the above rules about trigger safety and never pointing a gun anywhere but \\'down-range,\\' even if the gun \"isn\\'t loaded.\" \\n \\n \\n Follow those three rules always. If/when you encounter somebody who does not follow these rules, tell them the rules, and respectfully let those around you know that if they are comfortable breaking the above rules, you aren\\'t comfortable being around them and firearms at the same time. If they don\\'t respect  that,  they aren\\'t worth your time. \\n There is obviously a lot more to it than the above - keep your firearms clean, don\\'t shoot rounds you are unsure about (ground-scores and live ammunition are mutually exclusive), don\\'t travel with loaded weapons unless you expect to use them en-route, don\\'t discharge within city limits, keep your guns hidden AND locked while in storage, don\\'t spread word all over town that you have guns stored in your home, etc etc...but follow those first three and you\\'re good to go until you start buying your own guns/ammo. \\n Depending on where you are, there are likely local shooting ranges / clubs, potentially even offering firearm rentals.

What is this place, some sort of ghetto skate-park? It\\'s hard to even tell, there\\'s like a funbox, an improvised flat-ramp, and a palette?! When taking pictures of a skate park, make sure others will recognize it as one. The only thing that tells anybody that this is for doing tricks on your newfangled push-board is a sticker  inside  the funbox that says \"skate\" and you really have to hunt to even see it. Maybe come back once your friends learn how to build better/more visually interesting ramps? Either that or throw the palettes out into the wheat and just shoot the empty lot as a landscape. \\n It could actually end up being really cool if you removed everything but one feature, and got somebody to  use  it. In my head it would be really interesting to see wheat for days, endless blue skies, and somebody tail-sliding across the funbox out there in the middle of nowhere. The juxtaposition that would create is intriguing, engaging, interesting. But again you would want to clear all the other lumber/ramps/whatever out of the frame, they would distract more than contribute I think. \\n It could also be cool if you maybe moved  all  of the ramps and had a skater rolling into the sunset, silhouetted, that could maybe be nice too! \\n I would also advise against the centered horizon here, I would push it to one of the horizontal thirds. Personally I\\'d push the horizon down so that 2/3 of the frame is blue sky since the sun is the most captivating subject in your frame, but pushing the horizon up towards the top so that most of the frame is asphalt could be cool too! \\n Good exposure here, and I also really like the lines created by the paddock and the field. Colors seem a bit wonky from shooting straight into the sun, you might want to play with them in post if you can. \\n The point is to not get discouraged; I wouldn\\'t print this let alone hang it on my wall, but that doesn\\'t mean you need to just put down the camera and give up. Figure out exactly what you do and don\\'t like about the image, and then research those things and practice them. For instance in this case the comments I\\'ve seen are all on composition and subject-matter. What separates this grouping of objects and scenery from any other still-life or landscape? What about their arrangement, relationship, individual appearance, what makes them different from some oil painting of a bowl of fruit that most seem to agree is beautiful? \\n In my experience, it seems like you first learn to isolate and record as little as possible before you\\'re able to move up and effectively record more.

Yes, by law  Google/YouTube have to comply  with this. The hard part is that entertainment companies keep trying to extend the copyright laws to keep a hold of the content to keep making money, and nothing goes into public domain to help content creation.

I was more than happy to include some posters with his order, free of charge. \\n We provide standard shipping without track & trace and WITH track & trace. The buyer wanted to save money and opted for the standard shipping. \\n The record was sent out to the buyer less than 2 weeks ago. Shipping to his country usually takes 4-5 working days but from experience can take up to 20, especially if a record is held by customs. The buyer refuses to contact the post office to see if they can give any more info and started insulting me. The buyer later also stated he needed it as a birthday gift (after shipping) and has now opened a claim via PayPal. From some stories on here I know PayPal usually sides with the buyer in this case.

Called them out on them being musically oblivious and they shut up for the rest of time. \\n I decided to go with only Hardcore Punk since I could be pretty specific instead of just generic talking. Talked about what hardcore is (let them hear OFF! - Full Of Shit), how it originated (Minor Threat, Black Flag and Bad Brains) and the subculture that goes with it. For the subculture I took the Straight Edge lifestyle as an example (Let them hear Out Of Step). \\n Last Was a bit of talking about shows and hardcore dancing. To give them a proper example of hardcore dancing I showed Sick Of It All's Step Down and for pitting I took a live clip of Bad Brain's Banned In D.C. Hilarity pretty much ensued at both. Class got a good laugh out of it and overall seemed to enjoy the presentation. Most people didn't care for the music, but I guess they did learn a thing or two.

My first punk show was Anti-Flag, I knew the band 4 days before I went from Die For Your Government and One Trillion Dollars. It was a cheap show and sounded like fun so I tried them out. Best 10 bucks I ever spent. I learned how welcoming the punk comunity is. Also had my first mosh and circle pit there. I can honestly say those were the best 10 bucks ever spent. \\n Just watch these videos and you'll understand why I enjoyed it. ;)\\n Clash cover \\n But yeah, after Anti-Flag I started discovering punk. I had been checking it out a bit since my fav band was Rise Against (still is, however, the singer was sick when I went to their gig, they weren't that good =/) but after Anti-Flag it skyrocketed. Soon I managed to get my hands on a Minor Threat discography CD. It took a while to grow on me, but I love them now. \\n So me and a mate decided to go to a festival since many bands we enjoy went there. The day before we also went to a Ignite/Strung Out show which was amazing. Zoli (singer) even pulled up some random band from the crowd and let them play. Oh well, next day: festivaltime. We were supposed to see bands like Title Fight, Face To Face, Veara, The Black Pacific, OFF!, The Offspring and many more. \\nBut a storm came and people died, that was horrid. Won't talk about that here since it's about shows, you can ask me if you like. Might put it up as AMA on the other reddit. \\n We had however seen Title Fight play, which was an intense show and start of the festival. They're great new hardcore, check them out. Face To Face was a great show aswell, some small pits and everyone just enjoying theirselves, but man.. Then came The Black Pacific. That was intense! Almost lost my glasses in some of the pits during Blitzkrieg Bop. Everyone was jumping all over the place and we were having an amazing time. As soon as it ended, the storm had started though, and we saw a tent collapsing. Bittersweet. We went home that night, festival canceled and decided to go see OFF! on a clubshow along with The Bronx. I'd been dying to see Keith Morris perform ever since I listened to Black Flag, so of course I enjoyed that show a lot. We even managed to grab the set and chat a bit with Keith afterwards. \\n Last big show I've been to was Sick Of It All and they were just amazing. First wall of death and getting on stage with 50-100 people to shout along to Step Down and start a mini mosh on stage. ( \\n So how about you guys? I'd love to hear a story of someone that's seen Minor Threat, or pheraphs Fugazi, Black Flag? ;)\", \"Alright drummit. I've been drumming for almost 2 years now and I really want to start improving my bassdrumtechnique and mainly speed.

Jordan Burns, their drummer does have a double bass pedal but only uses this for the fills. He plays the basic punk beat with a single pedal and I want to learn this as well. The only thing I currently do is play the beat to a metronome and try speeding it up gradually.

Whether that's the case universally, it certainly seems to have worked for Hebrew. \\n First off -- many of the original speakers of Hebrew would have had passive knowledge of the language due to its use in religion. This lessened the workload compared to Irish, which often has to be taught from scratch. \\n Second -- many of the early Zionists were fleeing pogroms or discrimination or were Holocaust survivors. Their old lives were already in shambles and they had to start anything anew; what's a new language added onto that? \\n Third -- The Jews in Israel came from different linguistic backgrounds and Hebrew served as a lingua franca. The Irish, on the other hand, can communicate in English and have little reason (other than pure idealism) to change their language of daily life. \\n Fourth -- I have heard that Irish-language programs in Irish schools are plagued by many of the problems that affect other language courses -- a focus on gramar and a failure to engage the students effectively (disclaimer: completely anecdotal evidence).\", 'I\\'m afraid not -- the reason being, it\\'s REALLY freaking hard to create a definition for words that allows you to count them. Among the perplexing questions you have to deal with are: \\n Are we counting inflected forms of the same word, like \"walk\" and \"walked\"? How about really irregular ones? Is \"went\" different from \"go\"? \\n *How about compounds? One word or two? If compounds are words, well then the mere fact that we can count means every language has infinite words. How to deal with that? \\n How about cognates (words in different languages that are related). Are we counting \"amor\" (Spanish) and \"amore\" (Italian) as two different words? They could just as easily be seen as the same word in different dialects. Does counting them mean we have to count \"car\" and \"car-but-pronounced-with-a-British-accent\"? \\n How about when a word has two completely different meanings? Like \"duck\" (noun) and \"duck\" (verb)? \\n And we haven\\'t even STARTED on agglutinative languages.', \"Well, Europe got a slight headstart when they landed on the geographical jackpot and ended up on a continent with a bunch of really easy-to-domesticate animals. They also ended up on a continent with a nice horizontal shape. People tend to migrate East-West rather than North-South, because if you migrate North-South the climate changes and you have to figure out how to farm all over again. That means if a European had a good idea, it could travel all across Europe, where this is not as much the case in Africa. \\n Second of all, a ton of brilliant discoveries came from outside of Europe. The Middle East and China were really kicking ass at science all through the Dark Ages, while the Dark Ages in Europe were, well, Dark. Some African civilizations did quite well also, like Egypt and Aksum, but the lack of farm animals made things really quite difficult and took up a lot of everyone's time. \\n And later, Europeans came to Africa and totally destroyed the place by selling entire populations of people into slavery, brutalizing the locals, and dividing up the countries in ways that were more likely to cause conflicts. Something like that is kind of hard to come back from.\", \"First off, people who are against vaccines don't vaccinate their children. This puts their children in danger of catching diseases, which is not a very nice thing to do. \\n Second of all, there are plenty of people who would like to get vaccines, but can't for various reasons: maybe they're too young, maybe they are allergic to the vaccine, or maybe their immune system is compromised (this is what happens after someone undergoes chemotherapy, for example). Now  as long as everyone else gets vaccinated , these people are pretty safe - they can't catch the disease because they have nobody to catch it from. But if a lot of anti-vaccinating people ALSO don't catch the disease, now this whole crowd can catch it from them, and they're in danger.\", 'Interestingly enough, you may be able to go deeper. The Latin word for \"South\" (Australis) and \"eastern\" seem to be related. In fact, it looks like the word meaning \"east\" in Proto-Indo-European came to mean \"south\" in Latin. \\n Now how would you mix those two up? Possibly because Italy is on a diagonal slant, so the South part of Italy is also the East part of Italy. Or the two words might be related through the PIE root  aus , which means \"to shine\". That relates to the east (the sun rises in the east) and the South (this one\\'s  stretch -- \"to shine\" came to mean \"to burn\" and hot winds came from the south).', \"It's a difficult question, and so far no judge has ever had to answer it.

Dictionaries and grammars are copyrighted by the production company that made the fictional universe. But could you create a work of original Klingon poetry and sell it in a store? You'd probably get sued by whoever owns the copyright for Star Trek, but would they win? So far no one knows. \\n There are two cases that have come into the courts. The first was Loglan, an artificial language meant to be based entirely on formal logic. Many Loglan enthusiasts wanted to have a say in how the language should be as well as publish wordlists and whatnot; the original creator sued them. The Loglan users retaliated by changing every word (but keeping the grammar) and said they had created a new language, Lojban. IIRC, they won, but for some technical legal reason and not because the judge came to a definite conclusion on whether you can trademark a language. \\n The other is BlissSymbols, a method of communication though pointing at symbols on a board. It was picked up by a Toronto hospital to use with mute children. When the hospital tried to modify it to better suit their needs, the language's creator (who by all accounts was a bit nuts) tried to sue them.

You have a few in your family, but you might also want to try posting an ad online asking for a language partner or using the advanced search on the Couchsurfing website. \\n When you're by yourself, using the dictionary, the grammar and a lot of guesswork try to make simple and correct sentences. Imagine you're making small talk with a Limbu speaker -- what words would you use and grammatical structures would you use? Know at the very least, how to greet people and tell them about yourself (job, hobbies, residence, etc.). Honestly though, it's up to you where you start -- I don't know how you make small talk or what you're using the language for. Make the words you look up into flashcards.

I mean, I think that Eleven\\'s tenure has been a lot of nods, but it shouldn\\'t be appreciated purely for that.  The thing that I find about the past two and a half seasons is that it\\'s at the same time more positive and darker than much of its predecessor, in a path similar to the original series (which had a deep darkness overshadowed by some of the sillier aspects).  I haven\\'t watched all of the Doctors yet--that probably won\\'t happen until the rest of my regular shows wrap up for a bit--but I\\'ve watched a few episodes here and there of the First, Second, Fourth, and Seventh Doctors (as well as New Who\\'s Nine through Eleven so far) and part of the issue is also the fact that Doctor Who has grown so much since the rejuvenation of the series. \\n The cheapest of Ninth Doctor tales was still leagues above the old series in terms of spending and production value.  Then again, that\\'s because we have changed a lot (both sides of the pond, of course) and there was a new paradigm to contend with.  Hour-long episodes are now the norm, as are significant production values.  Having worked in film and television on and off the past two years, I have to admit I was surprised how quickly they were able to put together classic episodes of Doctor Who when reading  Elisabeth Sladen: An Autobiography .  Her shock at coming back and seeing how different everything was during the Russell T Davies era was significant. \\n That said, what excites me with the nods is that I feel like it will make the Fiftieth Anniversary more memorable and exciting--even if they can\\'t work all the previous Doctors in, they can make references.  Then again, I\\'m one of the few people who appreciate the Tim Burton Dark Shadows film for the references (yes, it is a HUGE trainwreck as far as writing and characterization goes, but there are SO MANY great nods to the series and it\\'s so  PRETTY! ). \\n Perhaps in the transition to a new companion and that being in conjunction with the fiftieth anniversary of Who, we\\'ll maybe get a transition back towards things being more Classic.  The Pond Era is very much Moffat making his mark on Doctor Who and changing it from the Davies era. \\n One can only hope. \\n (Also, I think the ironic thing about the \"coolness\" is that it\\'s inherently cheesy--the Doctor is so focused on X thing being \"cool\" that you know it can\\'t really be cool.  It\\'s almost a meta thing.) \\n Edited to include', \"In the past my understanding was the same as stated in another comment, that she was an alternate future Sailor Moon who had abandoned the fight. \\n Thinking about it, though, it might be more accurate to see her as someone more akin to Sailor Pluto, standing outside of time and having a bit more control over that kind of thing (seeing as she already lived through the whole Cauldron War thing) and this could open up the possibility for her to be a descendant of the Usagi or Serenity line, as none of the presently known ones of that line have the double bun. \\n And I just checked the Sailor Moon wiki; apparently the Cosmos Crystal was the sailor crystal of the Galaxy Cauldron.  Odds are this was the sailor crystal that Sailor Cosmos would have used, not the Silver Crystal, meaning that Sailor Cosmos was not in fact a version or incarnation of Sailor Moon but in fact a wholly separate character.  She also has her own guardian (Guardian Cosmos shows up in the manga), though we never see a smaller guardian for Sailor Moon. \\n In fact, despite the fact that apparently Naoko herself said that Sailor Cosmos is a future incarnation of Sailor Moon, the wiki provides no actual citations (saying that it was in a panel for the 1998 SDCC and an out-of-circulation magazine) and it doesn't exactly make sense for the reasons I listed above.  More likely she sees herself as her own generation's Sailor Moon/Neo Queen Serenity analogue and takes on similar traits to deepen the visual connection.\", 'Okay, so I was listening to a podcast discussing the newest Christmas episode and I might have realized why Amy Pond and, by extension, Rory, have become such mainstays of the past two and a half series of Doctor Who. It\\'s a little bit of a leap, but hear me out... \\n During the ending of The Big Bang, when Amy re-creates the universe, Amy remembers the Doctor back into existence. \\n We all remember this scene if we saw it--Amy sees River, she notices the TARDIS journal, and she remembers the Doctor-- HER  Raggedy Doctor. \\n She doesn\\'t just call him back into being, she calls him home. \\n She doesn\\'t ask him to come, she scolds him for being late to her wedding. And her specific invocation for bringing back the Doctor and the TARDIS, the words that finish bringing them back into being? \\n Something old. Something new.\\nSomething borrowed. Something blue. \\n Now, Amy initially speaks these words while trying to describe the TARDIS--but how well does this describe The Doctor himself? He is old, but re-created to be something new. He might be a person, but time with him is only borrowed, not forever. And what is the Eleventh Doctor eternally? Blue. Sad. Especially over his loss of the Ponds at the end of the Angels Take Manhattan. \\n Wait, that last part ended up being tangential, but I like it so I\\'m leaving it in. \\n Anyways, when he shows up he\\'s just the way that Amy would want him at the wedding: dressed up and ready to go. And when she brings the Doctor back, Rory remembers... everything. He\\'s not only Rory, he\\'s Rory and the Lone Centurion. He\\'s better than just plain old Rory. \\n Anyways, when this happens, Amy imprints the need to return into the Doctor. He isn\\'t just the Doctor--he\\'s Amy\\'s Doctor. He can\\'t quit the Ponds until they won\\'t let him back anymore, and even the departure is difficult.\\nWhat isn\\'t said, though (because it isn\\'t realized within the confines of the series), is that it is not only because of the potential paradox of running into the Ponds after knowing that the end of that adventure is \"The Final Farewell\" but also since Amy actually wishes him away forever--she lets go of him, she rejects any further experience with him. And The Doctor falls into a depression because he has lost his newest and literalest raison d\\'\u00eatre (literally \"reason to be\" or \"reason of being\").', 'Trying to watch Series 7 as a \"season\" or \"half-season\" of television so far is difficult for me.  I was trying to figure out a good way to put it, and the other day I realized the paradigm shift that I needed to take to really appreciate this half-series so far:  instead of looking at the episodes so far as \"the first half of Series 7,\" it makes more sense to watch them as \"The Amy/Rory Specials.\" \\n I know that\\'s probably a bit of a leap for most people, but think of it this way... \\n \\n Amy and Rory, in their impending departure, are maturing a great deal of development in a push towards accepting their departure--much like the Tennant Specials did for the Tenth Doctor. \\n \\n The episodes are far more self-contained and, well, episodic than those of Series 5 or 6 (reminiscent of the changes in tone between the Tennant Specials). \\n \\n Amy and Rory, or just Rory if you don\\'t like Amy, are beloved Companions, and are getting a sendoff that has been awaited for a while and much-anticipated.

David Tennant/Tenth Doctor .', \"Disney's Descendants is a beautiful camp masterpiece that's about how the traits of parents don't necessarily pass down to their children.  Prince Ben is a pretty good judge of characters and thinks about his actions (unlike his father the Beast), the children of the villains on the Isle of the Lost are only villains until the real option of being heroes presents itself, and the children of two classically kind Disney couples are self-absorbed brats. \\n Most of the music was composed directly for the film and regardless of whether it appears to be diegetic or not, it fits the characters and comes from them.  The one exception? \\n That's right--Be Our Guest.  This is performed by the main group of Auradon Prep students to greet family members during their family day celebration.  The words of the song are welcoming and a tribute to Ben's parents, but the kids really don't know how to do this--they're not servants; they were raised as royalty and besides... The song is  so  last generation. \\n This is a song the kids try to adapt into their own style and it fails... Horribly, if you all people who like their version performed by a French candelabra. It's not them.  They weren't servants.  They know how to put on airs and appear proper, but they don't know how to genuinely greet or accept strangers. \\n As much as they pretend to understand it and enjoy it, the song was literally not written for them.  It's out of place.\", 'Sorry for this long ramble; it just sort of popped into my head tonight. \\n I wonder if the relationships that the Companions had with the Doctor during the Russell T. Davies era served as representations of how RTD himself felt about the Doctor when he was growing up in a somewhat parallel development--or at least how he would imagine being as a companion, to some extent. \\n We have three main Companions during the RTD era (all three female), but we see four main relationships explored through them: Rose as a proteg\u00e9e to the Doctor, Rose as a love interest for the Doctor, Martha as one with unrequited feelings towards the Doctor, and Donna as a friend to the Doctor.  Why do I think these could be feelings that RTD had growing up?  Well... Let\\'s look at the Classic Who Doctors.  (And consider that RTD was born the same year that Doctor Who premiered to get a better handle on how strong some of the Doctors would be in his mind...) \\n The first two Doctors were intelligent men who were guides to their respective Companions and led them in learning.  Though there were many times when these two acted in a more parental fashion, more familial-feeling relationships didn\\'t really emerge until the Third and Fourth Doctors (Three forming a very parental bond with Jo Grant and Four being close to Sarah Jane and Adric, though seeing Romana as a bit more of an equal). \\n That said, the first two Doctors had regenerated by the time RTD was 6, so he likely actually remembers almost none of the First Doctor\\'s serials and would have Three and Four as the core of his \"childhood Doctors.\"  Rose\\'s relationship with Nine is reflective of Jo Grant\\'s and Sarah Jane Smith\\'s relationships with Three and Four--very familial, and protective in a non-romantic way.  Perhaps a bit of Rose\\'s relationship with Ten was also influenced by a level of the Four-Romana relationship, where the \"equality\" with Romana was also infused with some of the behind-the-scenes relationship between Lalla Ward (Romana II) and Tom Baker.  Don\\'t forget that, in his mid-teens at this point, it might have seemed to be a broken taboo to see a Doctor in a relationship with (and married to!) one of his Companions, especially as someone who felt like an outsider for his own sexuality. \\n There wasn\\'t really a superbly \"handsome\" Doctor until Five, though he seemed a bit more stand-offish to me with his companions than romantic (though I can easily see a crush forming on this incarnation of the Doctor, especially a gay lad nearing 20). \\n Because both Peter Davison  and  the Fifth Doctor weren\\'t known at the time for having a relationship with a Companion, he could be seen as less attainable and therefore the Doctor would likely have gone to a place where yes, this is a very attractive man, but he\\'s not interested in you because he sees you as nothing more than a child, even an intelligent one--much like how Ten views Martha. (This could have even been made worse if RTD identified strongly with Adric, who saw more kindness with Four and was pushed a bit more to the side once the Fifth Doctor came around--also, Adric\\'s actor Matthew Waterhouse later came out as gay.) \\n And then you have the very specific friendly antagonism (sort of) and \"testing\" that seems more indicative of the behaviors of the Sixth and Seventh incarnations of our remaining Time Lord.  While not necessarily equals, these two respected and challenged their Companions a bit more (though I\\'m less familiar with Six, I know that he is at least somewhat challenging towards Peri during his early adventures with her--and Seven is very challenging in his \"mentorship\" of Ace). \\n But whose relationship with the Tenth Doctor does this sound like?  Yes, my point exactly: Donna Noble.  While not his equal, Donna reminds me quite a bit of Ace in her willingness to challenge the Doctor, her concerns when she thinks that he is keeping information from her, and--actually, this is a brilliant final piece of the puzzle--the fact that she becomes a Time Lord, sort of.  (Short reason why the \"companion becoming a Time Lord\" thing is a connection: Ace was to have entered the Time Lord Academy in future seasons had Doctor Who continued from its 1989 season).', \"note: This is mainly taken from my earlier post on /r/FanTheories and has been developed a bit more since then, mainly taking a little bit of inspiration from a comment from /u/elvnsword \\n After rewatching Time of the Doctor on BBC America this past weekend, I started believing one of the fan theories regarding Tasha Lem--that she is, in fact, some future version of River Song.  Key points in this are her flirtatious nature with the Eleventh Doctor (especially considering his flirtation back), her ability to pilot the TARDIS with ease (saying that the Doctor was the one who's hard to pilot), the Doctor saying that she has been fighting her psychopathic tendencies her entire life, even her fighting the programming of the Dalek in comparison to River fighting the programming done to her by the Silence....  There are numerous similarities between the two women.  How could she exist in such a form?  Perhaps she was reconstituted from the version of River saved within the Library's mainframe (considering the fact that Tasha is the Mother Superious of the Church of the Papal Mainframe, from which the Silence movement was born). \\n I began to wonder if another member investigatory party from Silence in the Library/Forest of the Dead might have also been reconstituted in a similar but flawed way--because she was saved as a corrupted file.  Of course I'm talking about  Miss Evangelista  that many other portions of her file were still corrupted in some way. \\n With data corruption, Miss Evangelista could have become unstable mentally (if she wasn't mildly so already). Her name is already Miss E (as far as we know, at least), and if she was brought back to life for a while she would age with similar coloring (the only exception would really be the slightly darker skin and bluer eyes of Missy).  Also, how similar is the perfection of the Promised Land or Paradise to somewhere you might see in CAL's imagination? \\n /u/elvnsword posed a slight variation on this [viewable here]( River fractured into both Tasha Lem and Missy/MissE as the result of attempting to get out of the Library hard drive. \\n I know both ideas are unlikely, but they both feel like they could cover what we've seen so far.\"]": "Based on the user's reddit postings, it can be inferred that the user is interested in the following areas:\n\n1.

In Software Engineering, the academics is about the software. \\n Please keep in mind my academic experience was back in the day where the cross-over point when deciding on an academic path was between Computer Science and Computer Engineering (or straight-up Electrical Engineering and choosing all of the computery elective stuff). In those cases, the Computer Science department was generally awkwardly crammed inside of the Mathematics department and the Computer Engineering department was generally stuffed into the Electrical Engineering department. That structure meant that CE students took some classes in the CS department, and CS students took some classes in the CE department. \\n Depending on how any given institution  started  departments for various computational things, they then had to make decisions on how to continue once nearly everyone figured out that this stuff wasn\\'t going away in the late 80s/90s and they needed a more permanent solution than what they had. \\n Some institutions mashed CS into their EE/CE programs. Some doubled down on the academic nature of CS and (to resist becoming trade schools) shoved their CS departments even further into the math side, while having some \"compromise\" programs like Information Management Systems, IT something or another, or Software Engineering. Regardless, some mix\\'n\\'match thing went on, and it\\'s likely very difficult to compare degree titles without looking at the actual curriculum. \\n My advice would be to look at what you actually  want to do.  Then assume you\\'re going to be 30% wrong about that. Look at the various programs at the various schools and look at the requirements. Look for how much leeway you have in those requirements. Look at the dependency trees for the classes involved. Hell, if you want, use the requirements and dependencies to properly, actually analyze the number of routes you could take to graduate and where the choke points are. \\n Take that knowledge and figure out which programs give you the most flexibility to learn different things. You will (hopefully) find something in your first few years that you want to do a deep-dive on. The freedom to, say, burrow through the undergraduate classes on a certain topic and take a graduate level class or three your last few years is a hell of a way to go, if the program allows it. \\n That was sort of a tangent and doesn\\'t directly address your question but...still...seriously, chose a program with some flexibility, whichever way you go. \\n That went a little sideways on me in terms of a straight-up answer, but I hope it\\'s helpful. No matter what you do, for the love of god take a discrete math class.', 'My absolute favorite was a bug that was so fascinating, I didn\\'t mind burning a week on it, because I had plenty of time to spare on the contract. \\n I was implementing a cpu feature in a Unix-y kernel. The bug itself only reared its ugly head when running on bare metal, never in a VM. That should give you some small idea of how far down the rabbit hole I was. \\n I could only provoke it with memory allocations that were a particular size, I want to say 1gb, could have been 512mb, this was quite a while ago, some multiple of page size. Specifically when doing a tight loop of malloc, followed by free. \\n I was wandering down the twisty pathways based on that one clue. Pretty soon, I was stymied. \\n Then one night, I had a dream. In this dream, was sitting in front of my computer, talking Dennis Ritchie through the code, and every way I had attacked the problem. As I was scrolling, he said \\'stop!\\' and pointed at a function. \"It\\'s right here\", he said, \"you missed it because you were chasing this large allocation/page boundry hunch, it\\'s actually a timing issue.\" \\n I sat bolt upright in bed and rushed to my computer. I grepped for the function name in the source and opened it up in vim. Suddenly I felt foolish. Obviously I\\'ve spent way too much time with this code, and my sleepin brain remembered that function. I wrote a \"//Dennis Ritchie Says Here\" comment and went back to sleep. \\n The next day, I went to work and told people that Dennis Ritchie came to me in a dream and told me where the bug I\\'d spent the last 3 days ranting about and picking people\\'s brains over. They asked me where it was, and I admitted that I had entirely forgotten, but I had dove out of bed, made a comment, and went back to sleep. \\n It was maybe an hour and a half later and I had a working fucking patch. It was right in the function the dream told me, and it was, indeed, timing. A lock on a resource had to be freed to call a function that could sleep, and when that resource was relocked, there was some locally-scoped piece of information that could change during that sleep. It wasn\\'t reread after the lock.', 'I actually had to consider responding to this, because my first comment sounds like it (in some small way) changed your thinking about cops.

The way I wrote came off as overly familiar. That comes from talking to cops socially and having LEOs in my distant family. That comes from having seen some of the training materials and knowing how and why it is taught. It comes from knowing which aspects of the job are most likely to kill them. \\n It sounds like you have an opinion similar to what I used to have in my teen years. \"People become cops because of X, Y, and Z.\" Whether it\\'s hating fun, wanting to strut around with a gun, small genital size, forcing people to show you respect, whatever negative and sometimes true stereotype you have. \\n That said cops are people.

They described in detail how my face had smashed into the car hood, how I pinwheeled over the car like a rag doll, and then landed in a way that suggested unconciousness or death. It was surreal for both of us.', 'I\\'m late to the game on this one, but I think I can offer a slightly more comprehensive explanation. As I see it, there\\'s two issues in play: \\n \\n Why is it an appropriate series of jokes? \\n \\n The show frequently satirizes gender roles in genre fiction. Brock himself is built as a sort of caricature of James Bond/Race Bannon/hyper-masculine sex ideal. He\\'s an absurdly manly chauvinist who, in the presence of better company, wouldn\\'t be seen as terribly bright, sane, or in control. He just happens to in the company of less intelligent, less enlightened, less sane people. So, I\\'ll call his inclusion in the scene a wash. It\\'s entirely in character. If you\\'re not a fan of any of the strip club scenes, or Brock\\'s other quasi-misogynistic flaws, you can probably skip the rest of my explanation. That\\'s the character we\\'re working with. \\n That brings us to the other participant in that dialogue: Hunter. Hunter himself(?) has had a set of breasts that he was incredibly fond of, bordering on monomaniacal narcissism. In my mind, his character gets a pass because from his point of view, he\\'s comparing the anonymous stripper\\'s breasts to his old \"glorious, perfect\" pair. I mean, the scene even opens with Hunter talking about being able to pole dance better than half of the strippers. That\\'s likely why Hunter gets the cleverest and most incisive lines. \\n So, those two are coming at the issue from entirely different places, both of which are less naive than, say, the \"How I know you\\'re gay\" riffs from  40 Year Old Virgin . There\\'s something much more going on, interpersonally, than two guys being mean behind someone\\'s back. I would even argue that those two super-spies being petty and catty when they\\'re just chilling out in some way minimizes their steely resolve and all the rest. \\n The scene also serves as an establishing shot for when the guild wasps show up. If they just established with a Sphinx plane in the air or some such, you wouldn\\'t have an idea of who\\'s there and how casually they\\'re taking their flight. \\n \\n Why is it funny? \\n \\n Ok, open your mind up for a minute and try to come with me. Go read the transcript again, and change it to apply to a male stripper. Do you find the line \"I want to build two little caskets and give his nuts a tasteful, dignified funeral\" funny? What if they\\'re talking about the ears of someone of an unspecified gender? \"Those things are like a little kid with progeria cracking all of his ribs catching a nerf football -- just sad. Damnit, they\\'ve got some mournful ears!\" Hell, even imagine the original dialogue being said by Dr. Mrs. The Monarch and Sally Impossible. Any better? \\n If you can imagine them riffing on something else using the same pattern of escalation and one-upping each other and find it funny, hopefully the first point will help you to (or understand why others) find it funny. \\n Hopefully that helps explain why people (well, I) find it funny. That said, I actually laughed out loud at the \"blood and clown paint\" line from the most recent episode so I\\'m probably not entirely  grown up  in my sense of humor.', 'I went and read the thread in question and I\\'ll attempt to shine a light on it.  THIS ENTIRE THING IS SPOILERS FOR SHERLOCK SEASON 2 EPISODE 1 \\n \\n Firstly, let\\'s look at the character of Irene Adler in the story  A Scandal in Bohemia  and the further mentions in other stories. In  ASiB , Irene Adler has a scandalous photograph of herself and the King of Bohemia. Keep in mind, the story was written in 1891, which heavily influences what could be considered scandalous. During the course of Sherlock attempting to get the photograph back from her, she sees through his disguise, thus \"beating\" or \"outwitting\" him. \\n \\n Keeping in mind again we\\'re talking about the 19th century, think about what  purpose  it serves to have a female character outwit Holmes? It demonstrates an amount of fallibility in Sherlock, especially when he is up against an opponent that he underestimates. And the underestimation bit is key to the fact that he was bested by,  gasp! , a woman. And  oh my!  an American at that! \\n Fallibility is important, because it would be incredibly boring to pick up a new Sherlock Holmes story if you always knew that he\\'d always be right and always win. The mysteries, the deduction, the cases, sure, they\\'re great. But they\\'re made better by the slight doubt raised by the case involving Irene Adler. \\n \\n What other  purpose  does the character serve across the canon? It also allows digressions into Sherlock\\'s feeling towards women and love. The introduction to  ASiB  talks about how much Holmes admires Adler and also discusses his attitude towards love. \\n Keep in mind again, 1891. This establishes that Sherlock isn\\'t all \"Eww, gross, I don\\'t like women!\" He admires one over all others, but there\\'s no place in his analytical mind for the \"softer passions.\" \\n In this regard,  ASiB  is the Victorian equivalent of \"No homo.\" \\n \\n Now, let\\'s look that the episode  A Scandal in Belgravia . In that episode, Irene and Sherlock spar, going back and forth. In the end, it\\'s revealed that she didn\\'t spend a huge chunk of the episode thwarting Sherlock on her own. Oh, no, she had Moriarty\\'s help. Oh, also, in the end she\\'s undone by her softness and sentimentality. Oh, but what\\'s this? Sherlock shows up and saves her! Maybe he does have \"softer passions!\" \\n A quick digression on the sexualiztion of the character: For the record, I don\\'t care. In the original story, the scandal is the vague impression that someone might have had a premarital relationship with a woman of a lesser social station. It takes a hell of a lot more to scandalize a royal family these days. \\n \\n I very much liked the episode, don\\'t get me wrong. However, let\\'s look at what the  purpose  of the character Irene Adler is. \\n The ultimate purpose of the character in the show seems to be to show that Sherlock can be sentimental. He goes and saves her in the end, months after he outwitted her. \\n Now, that can be read two ways. One way is that he admired her and thus wanted to save her. The other way is that he has \"softer passions.\" And here we get to the heart of it. \\n The case for Sherlock saving her out of respect and admiration is heavily undermined by the fact that she reveals that Moriarty is behind a bunch of her most clever acts. How much respect would he have for someone who didn\\'t even think up their best gambits? And how much admiration would he have for someone that\\'d work with Moriarty? \\n So, that pushes us towards the second one and thus the conclusion that they\\'re writing a Sherlock that doesn\\'t possess a \"cold, precise but admirably balanced mind\" but rather a softer, warmer one. \\n I don\\'t think people really hated the Adler episode that much, so much as they don\\'t want Adler to come back and thus tempt the writers into going all gooey and squishy with the character. \\n \\n You know, or someone just pitched the last couple scenes and they were so well structured with such a mass audience payoff they couldn\\'t help but use them.']": "Based on the postings, the user seems to be interested in the following areas:\n\n1.

I've been prioritising academic art study since I was about 14, and wrestling with the philosophical question of what art is, since the beginning of my MA, almost 10 years ago. I've worked professionally as an 'artist' since 2003 (I use 'artist' because others would, and I do, question the validity of that title, given my function: it seems largely to be a title by legacy) \\n I don't like art-for-art's sake - I like design; whether it's industrial, graphic, musical, illustrative... I like solutions to problems... The business making images or sculptures, or multi-media installations, purely for display in galleries  AS ENTERTAINMENT ,  I like - if it's a positive message. I don't much care for the self-indulgent 'look-at-me' artists, or those that are taking the piss with deconstructions or discussions of what 'art' is, or how far they can push it. I'm a firm believer that you can take all of art's tendancies to absorb culture, technology, fashion, politics from around it, and use it to supply the flair in solutions to larger problems. \\n But then there's the argument for contributing to human culture... It's absolutely necessary to record where we've been in history - and fewer 'things' record humanity better, and more accurately than Visual art. (In my view, written language is just as corruptible as the handmade visual image, yet the image can be more engaging and descriptive).  I think here, the only thing that dates this process as 'modern' is the use of a digital camera - something that is almost certainly used for convenience: This process  could  have been performed at any point in history since the first time soot-on-surface was observed. \\n There's also the argument for the individual's right to express themselves. Yes, this might be a really time-intensive and labour-intensive method, but that's probably part of what he wants to communicate with the work. \\n Steven Spazuk, has found a quite eccentric method of using charcoal to render an image to a 2D surface.

So work out what you want to communicate about yourself, then be Super-Simple and elegant in communicating it verbally and visually.\\nSimplicity is the essence of communication - don't do anything too complex!\", 'Some value Experience over education - and indeed, even if you have a good degree, it\\'ll take a big risk for a company to take you on without experience. \\n If you\\'ve already been offered a place at a company (doing what you would have been doing.. \"Game design\" isn\\'t CG, in the games industry - Game design,  typically  isn\\'t about visuals..), I say take it. \\n It\\'ll mean you\\'re earning - and unless you have a scholarship where your fees and expenses are covered in school, there are few other reasons for you to not take it. \\n I  would prefer it to be another way: I\\'m a Masters graduate and an artist in the games industry, and I think my BA and MA were invaluable for the work that I do. For me, Degrees are as important a measure of character, determination, and dealing with deadlines and punctuality,  as much they are a measure of intelligence, ability or technique. \\n The industry is a business - and it always helps that your employees respect how things are done, respect colleagues, respect deadlines, responsibilities, deliverables - along with the stuff like raw technical and creative ability. \\n <rant>\\nI\\'d like to see Bachelors degrees to be about technique and knowing tools - letting graduates,  without exception , leave uni and straight away be able to contribute to the day-to-day operations of a company. \\nA Masters would be a more academically-focused course (accessible only by BA graduates) with a syllabus allowing graduates to learn an industry\\'s nuances. They graduate and can contribute to the day-to-day operations, AND the structure/future plans of the company. \\nPHD graduates should carry the technique from the BA, and the creative and improvisational problem-solving technique from the MA, into far deeper principles of industries -  Graduates  should  be able to fundamentally lend insight to affect Industries for the better. \\n Sadly  - Some BA degrees are excellent, and some are terrible - and a First-class from a terrible school, on paper, is equal to a First-class degree from a top school. \\nStandardisation is expensive and necessary for any of this to ever be realised. \\n Academia was set up to help child-workers enter the workforce during the industrial revolution and be sufficiently industry-aware, in order to keep the manufacturing companies productive: no learning curve - fundamental skills in literacy and numeracy, and also vocational knowledge. \\nWe\\'ve come a hundred years, and the best thing uni seems to be able to do is take students\\' money, give them a slip of paper, yet in no way prepare them for industry - instead, they are only dropping out of the larger scheme: to get more University professors. \\n I\\'m a firm believer that academic analysis and technique can and will be invaluable in future innovation - ESSENTIAL for the continuing success of creative industries. \\n</rant>', 'Your portfolio will be your solution to the problem \"how do I best deliver samples of my work to a potential employer\" - Thinking out of the box WILL get noticed. I\\'ve recently had to prepare a portfolio of my work and I approached the problem my own way. It didn\\'t really resemble the typical game portfolio, and did the lion\\'s share in gaining me the job. \\n My Advice - \\n Don\\'t underestimate how much work it\\'s going to take,  don\\'t underestimate who you\\'ll be up against, and don\\'t underestimate the recipients of your work. \\n Also, and I think most importantly, Never underestimate the validity of games as an artform, and never view them as somewhere that doesn\\'t deserve as much effort as other industries - it\\'s not a stepping stone to the visual effects or Feature-film industry.. \\n if I were you, i\\'d read all the sites like cgtalk.com, and look at work - but don\\'t post your work to public spaces yet. Your portfolio is only as strong as your weakest piece... And while you\\'ll be applying to places as a Junior (your work won\\'t be as strong as the seniors and veterans that post work), it will take someone to spot potential for you to get work. As companies won\\'t want to set a precedent for poaching from Forums (although that does occasionally happen), you should send work direct to them. \\n The argument for making your work as visible as possible through posting on forums is valid to a point, i guess - but once you have a body of work together you should host it on something that presents you as a brand - not as a subsidiary of CGSocieties et al. \\nYou\\'re an artist, who has to offer unique and creative solutions to common problems, using a complete palette of techniques. Use those forums as a knowledgebase, by all means - but don\\'t get into the pissing contests that these kind of things always descend into. (it\\'s REALLY easy to get discouraged). \\n As someone else has said, you should be working constantly, preparing beautiful CG work. High res or Low res, I don\\'t think it really matters - if it shows off your ability to apply your own flair to exceptional technical ability, include it. Just make sure that your Low-res is somehow relevant to the games industry (make  it conform to an engine\\'s budget  requirements) and make sure that your High-res doesn\\'t look the least bit like CG. THE big trick of constant work, is to know when your mini-projects are finished. It\\'s also important for your employer to know that you can tell when your own work is finished. You should aim to get a project finished every 3 or 4 days, and in your folio. Make your work a mixture of real-world objects, and stuff you\\'ve designed, but make it real-world heavy. As a Junior you\\'ll be working from others\\' concepts, OR photo-reference - your company will have to know beyond any doubt that you can model and texture accurately from reference. \\n Your work should never betray your technique: you should never be able to tell which program you used to perform a CG art task. \\n There are going to be compromises, especially working in games - you will have to conform to triangle and texture budgets, but you should never have texture-smearing/stretching, inconsistencies in texture resolution (on differnt objects, and within the faces of the same object), no folded edges, no inside-out portions, no holes, Never allow standard Photoshop brushes to be indentified in your textures. In high-res work, never have triangles/edges visible at any time - round areas should be  perfect , and never present Z-brush work in any of the standard Z-brush materials; try to go the extra distance, and render the Z-brush mesh properly. \\n Companies will never relocate people for junior roles. So look for local work, or be prepared to move yourself. Similarly, international companies can\\'t sponsor a work permit application for a junior, either. \\n Grease the wheels as much as you can - don\\'t let your prospective employer have ANY difficulties seeing your work, or getting in touch with you. Make ABSOLUTELY sure that all your contact details are correct and active.  - Get your own domain, and link through that - it looks WAY more professional and aware of details than an imgur, photobucket, flickr, cgsociety, or deviantArt account. \\n Get in touch with companies NOW. If you don\\'t have a portfolio yet, see it as an opportunity to open a dialogue: ask them if they\\'d be willing to hire juniors - and ask what they\\'d be looking for in a Trainee/Junior portfolio. \\n Get a speciality: Character art, Vehicular art, Environmental art, Animation. It\\'s very tempting to think that you\\'re doing a company a favour by appearing as a jack-of-all-trades, or a generalist. This will only be appealing if it\\'s a TINY company, with 2 or 3 artists. If you want to get into AAA development, or development for older consoles, or hand-helds, you have to be pigeon-holed by a company easily. They will have a function for you to perform, and if you don\\'t appear dedicated to the task, you\\'ll be disregarded in favour of someone who does. (environment artist roles come up most often - every game needs a backdrop) \\n That\\'s all i can think of right now. \\n W', \"Next thing you'll simply HAVE to do, is couple bryce with Poser, \\n Then you, too, can have a surreal landscape with a green/purple sunset, a volcanic island in the background, and a ballerina wearing a lampshade in the foreground.\", 'I got my Masters in 2003 in Games art, and have worked for SCEE since - I\\'m a lead artist now. \\n My advice - pick a specialism. \\n it\\'s rare that a studio will hire a generalist, and rarer still a trainee generalist with no industry experience. \\n you stand a far higher chance of employment as a trainee as an environment artist. Bigger studios are tending to outsource anything that isn\\'t a whole world, entire level, or environment. So demonstrate that you can manage the structure of an entire level, its lighting, its gameplay nuances and intricacies, its art-style, and consistent distribution of triangles and textures. \\n Also - adhering to texture budget and shader instruction/frag count is supremely important. Knowledge of an engine serves to get you used to sticking to budgets, but intricate knowledge is studio-specific. If you\\'re a quick study, you can afford to wait and get used to a game-engine in the time between applying, interview and starting. (saying that you\\'re learning that studio\\'s engine, is a very good line in an interview). \\n Your chances for emlpoyment diminish as you specialise elsewhere: Character art requires a multitude of skills and experience - rigging, vert-weight, bones, IK, muscles, even before you get to character art-style and how well you can implement it. Vehicular art (popular with racing/driving/sim studios), will carry fewer available jobs still. \\n If all you want is a job in a development studio, aim for Environment artist or World-artist, I say. and look for opportunities for placements, scholarships and internships. \\n the way the world is, financially, studios are very unlikely to hire juniors or trainees to perform work that they could ordinarily outsource for far less.  A  developer in a AAA studio typically costs $10,000 per month to sustain (in wage/bonuses/benefits/materials/techsupport/software/energy) - even trainees. \\n The more indespensible on-site skills, are things like Code and Animation - maybe even design to a point. Although, design is something of a soft-skill, if technical processes aren\\'t involved; and even if they are involved, chances are that they\\'d be bespoke tools for that company, and non-transferrable if you choose to move on. \\n Creatively speaking - it helps if your subject matter is unique. There\\'s an expression  \"First or Best\". as a trainee, you stand a better chance of making an impact by being unique, rather than trying to beat existing artists at what they do.\\nBE AS AWARE AS POSSIBLE ABOUT OTHER VISUAL STYLES IN GAMES AND OTHER VISUAL MEDIA. \\n the last thing the games industry needs is a derivative artist. \\n you need to appear to be an artist capable of works of unique beauty, As well as being able to conform completely to a games visuals. \\n I hope bits of this is helpful!']": "Based on the user's postings on Reddit, it can be inferred that the user is interested in the following areas:\n\n1.

As a disclaimer, I've almost never had guys approach me, so I really can't make any firsthand comparisons.\", \"My suggestion is hormonal birth control: the pill, NuvaRing, depo-provera, etc. \\n I wouldn't recommend simply deciding to go on hormonal birth control because it's an extra layer of security. For what it's worth, you're still putting hormones into your body, so you should consider the other potential health effects (side-effects) with your doctor. If you have certain health factors, there will be extra risks associated with BC; I think I read somewhere that extra weight will make birth control less effective; birth control pills will often change your mood [more or less, for better or worse]; efficacy may vary if you also take certain antibiotics; every individual's personal body chemistry may even react differently with different bc brands; etc.\", 'What do you think would be worse: telling a girl who lied about being raped that you believed her when there won\\'t be any legal ramifications, or telling a girl who was raped and considers you someone they can trust that you don\\'t believe her? \\n Rape is very devastating, and because so many rape victims are accused of lying when they do tell someone, most of them bottle it up inside or only share it with someone they think they know and trust. To accuse them of lying would be to betray that trust. \\n If you don\\'t believe her, just tell her that it would be better for her to talk to someone else about this instead of you, because you don\\'t know how to deal with it in a good way. Tell her that even if you do believe her but don\\'t think you can handle it appropriately. Do not tell her that you doubt her. \\n >She is (maybe rightfully so) angry that I asked how she let a situation like that escalate \\n Assuming she wasn\\'t lying about the rape, since you say it would be out of character for her to be, that is a very callous and cruel question to ask someone who was just assaulted. She doesn\\'t owe you any information at all about what happened, and even though it\\'s natural to be curious, you shouldn\\'t press her for details. If you believe her, the best you can do is just support her. \\n Also, it\\'s not uncommon for rape victims to choose not to report and not to prosecute. Most rapes go unreported because it is so shameful and because oftentimes the victims blame themselves. Plus, most rapes that are reported do not get successfully prosecuted and the alleged victim is put through hell in the courtroom-- having to relive the experience by describing it, being asked probing and attacking questions (especially by the defense), having their entire sexual history and character put on trial and possibly slandered, and facing the judgment of a roomful of strangers... \\n Rapes are hard to prove, and I can see why it would be hard proving guilt in her case. She agreed to meet up with the guy, she\\'s not even sure if it was even rape (even though she didn\\'t consent), it was most likely not incredibly violent and not violent enough to cause serious injuries, and depending on her sexual history (or the fact that she\\'s even had sex at all), some people will automatically consider her a slut. A lot of people would conclude she had been asking for it. Plus, in her social/dating life, a lot of people would consider a rape victim \"damaged goods,\" so she may want to keep it quiet. \\n But here\\'s the thing-- one is never \"asking for it,\" and that never justifies rape. A woman can be dressed in almost nothing, drunk or drugged, and walking down a dark alley alone at night, and even though that is unwise, it does not mean that raping her isn\\'t wrong.']": "Based on the reddit postings, the user appears to be interested in the following areas:\n1.

Here's a Zhu - Faded remix I did. The saw patch(es) run throughout the entire song, usually filtered in some way, but they come out in their full glory at 2:09. \\n The full saw patch uses a Virus TI high-frequency supersaw, and Serum to pad out the midrange. If anyone wants deets on how I built them, let me know. \\n quick edit: the Virus wasn't really necessary to get this sound. You can totally do it with just Serum or any other synth with good unison and high waveform resolution. The Virus just made is easier because it has a dead-sexy built in supersaw mode \\n Edit 2: Alrighty, I'll go over the basics of my supersaw strategy real quick. Keep in mind, even if you don't have the Virus, you can load Virus saw waveforms into Serum - there's a huge pack floating around Reddit somewhere with custom wavetables and it's sweet. \\n For my high-frequency saw, I loaded in a hypersaw on Oscillator 1 (or just grab any saw and stack it ~12 times with Unison in your soft synth), detuned until I got some of the high fuzzy stuff, and a basic saw in Oscillator 2. I left the basic saw volume relatively low, it's just there to give some focus to the sound. I also added a decent amount of white noise - white noise is VERY useful in getting that huge, warm, fuzzy pad effect. In the Virus' FX rack, I compressed it, added a bit of reverb, and used a Doppler delay to give it a bigger stereo field, similar to Massive's 'size' effect or Serum's hyper/dimension effect. \\n In an effects chain in the DAW, I distorted the crap out of it and HPF'd it around 3 kHz, then mixed a little back in with the original synth, to add texture. Also added light saturation to the whole thing. Finally, with EQ8, I cut it at 200 Hz, with another slight dip around 930, boost around 7kHz, and hi cut at 19 kHz. \\n My body saw patch is a little simpler. It uses two custom waveforms from that Serum pack I was talking about - Adventure Kid 0019 and Virus_WT_007, no unison, LPF at about 10:00, with Hyper/Dimension, a little bit of distortion, and a bitcrusher added in the DAW effects chain. It's low and digital-sounding by itself, but it fills out the high saw nicely. \\n I glued them both together with FabFilter Saturn, some EQ, and Ableton's compressor, and then ran the finished supersaw + the bass through LFO Tool and Glitch to get all the variations throughout the song. \\n Hope that helps, feel free to ask questions, and thanks for the kind words!\", 'I blacked out on mushrooms once. \\n I was young, relatively new to shrooms, and didn\\'t really understand how the experience changes as you increase dose. I kinda thought I\\'d just have more intense visuals, but a similar headspace.

I\\'m not really sure what happened after that, but when I came to (or, at least, got my memory back), I was lying on my stomach, alone, in the loft of the room, missing clothing, convinced that one of my best friends from college had overdosed and committed suicide, and that we (my tripping buddy, our shitty sitter, and I) were mourning him. The line \"so-and-so took acid, shrooms, and ecstasy, and killed themselves\" kept running through my head. I didn\\'t know where it came from, but as I was tripping balls, I assumed it was the truth. \\n This was a few hours after I blacked out, so I was past the peak and starting to regain some control. I eventually realized that nobody had died, came downstairs and tried to figure out what had happened. My tripping buddy had also had a dark moment, although it was much shorter and he got himself out of the hole before he got to my level.

They were in the Guinness Book for a while, and although there was technically a longer married (arranged marriage) couple, they were the longest traditional, western-style marriage, and it really was a beautiful relationship. \\n I never once saw them argue, fight, disagree, avoid each other, anything of the sort. They lived with my great-aunt, who passed shortly after they did, and they generally just hung around, read, and talked to us. Grandpa loved to talk about his childhood, Ma would mostly discuss her grandkids' fashion choices and food. It wasn't a 'we survived for 83 years' type deal, they genuinely still loved each other. \\n When Ma passed (on 6/6/06, superstitious younger-me remembers vividly), Grandpa only lasted 83 days without her. He had been in incredible health before she passed, and died peacefully in his sleep. I don't doubt that it was because he didn't see a point in living without her. \\n I'm a cynical man, I suck at relationships. Can't start them, can't make them last. But every time I think about them, I get a little shred of hope that love is a real thing. They met each other incidentally, fell for each other, married, and simply took care of each other.

I'd say 8 at an absolute minimum, 16 for futureproofing. The new quad core processors are pretty solid, it's mostly a matter of budget there. \\n Also look into new sound card options - for example, the Apollo line have build-in Universal Audio DSP processors that can take some effects processing strain off your computer.

The issue is that it's about something COMPLETELY DIFFERENT than the book. What made the book legendary wasn't that it was a fun, dramatic action tale about a boy being trained to battle space aliens. It was a much deeper book than that. Ender's Game deals with a myriad of moral conundrums, hypothetical sociopolitical situations (A lot of people forget about the badassery with the Warsaw Pact, and what happens at the end of the book), responsibility, and social interaction in a really unique and interesting scenario (Adult-intelligence children with often child-level impulsiveness). \\n The movie missed all of that. Sure, it was pretty, had some cool fight scenes, Harrison Ford was stoic and badass. But there were so many choices made that showed that the director, writers, SOMEONE down the line had no real appreciation for the heart of the story. \\n For instance. One of the things that bothered me more than anything - and I know it's a small thing, but bear with me - was that Bonzo was SMALLER than Ender. This is huge in so many ways. It changes so many things about their interactions, their relationship, and this relationship is one of the defining points of Ender's character. Ender even calls attention to the fact that Bonzo is so much bigger than him in the book - he uses it as a power play, goading Bonzo into fighting him on his level. It's HUGE. The whole thing is a metaphor for Ender triumphing over enemies with insurmountable advantages. And they cast someone a decent, noticeable amount shorter than Asa? When it would have been SO easy to find a talented, suitable actor who was physically appropriate, OR used camera tricks to make him look bigger? \\n Anyways. I had a huge list somewhere of all the things that bothered me about the movie (like I said, strong feelings), but I can't remember them all now.\", 'I\\'ve also had casual sex that was very kind and giving, even in the absence of a relationship or real intimacy. \\n Yeah, I feel like a lot of the pro-casual-sex people on this thread are really playing up the \"its no big deal, it\\'s not intimate, it\\'s just pleasure\" thing.

If you have issues, you can go to most full time professors and they will help gladly. (I took a grad level German class my last semester at MSU as I had completed all other requirements and met many of the grad students who were TA-ing at the time). \\n When I was there, Prof. Lovik was chair of the German program (I graduated Dec. 2012). He is a hard teacher, but AMAZING! Prof. Kim is Harvard educated and also AMAZING. I didn\\'t have any problems double majoring with IR, but I also didn\\'t have mandatory lab hours (however had to write double the amount of papers because both IR and German are lib arts based programs, so the difficulty can be debated). I didn\\'t love Prof. Mittman, but she loved me (she focuses on Eastern German history/ culture/ language, which is interesting, but not my area). \\n In terms of signing up, it\\'s not hard. You do it with your other courses through the MSU registrar. However, you can talk to a counselor specifically for the German language (and other languages; if you want German specific languages pick out one of the Profs and go to their office hours). Here\\'s the info for who to contact; scroll to the bottom for advising specific contact info:  check out the rest of the website while you\\'re there for info on minoring in German (which it sounds like you want to do) and other info). \\n German is easier to get into at the lower levels than say, Spanish, because it isn\\'t as in demand as Spanish. However, the sooner you can sign up the better as you get a better pick of your class times. \\n Also, on a different note, I found that I loved my \"out of major\" courses as they challenged my brain in a different way and kind of gave me a break. You might enjoy your German classes as they get you away from the math and science heavy classes necessary for engineering, and allow you to explore your lib arts side of your brain. For me, it got me out of politics and into a different realm which I relished, especially when my courses got very IR heavy later in my educational career.', 'I recently graduated from State and there are a ton of ways to partake without getting in trouble.

Obviously do what most of the other people have stated: be safe, know your limits, don\\'t be a dumb jackass trying to show off. \\n With the medical amnesty though, if you do end up doing something stupid, drinking too much, your buddy drank too much, etc. YOU HAVE OPTIONS other than an MIP. If you think you drank too much, or your friend is passing out, and you want to get your friend help, YOU CAN! Neither of you will not get an MIP. If you are incapacitated and willingly present yourself to emergency personnel, you will not get an MIP. If you accompany a friend to a health care facility, neither you nor the individual will get an MIP. And lastly (and more importantly), if you present yourself to a cop stating you need medical assistance, you will not get an MIP. \\n You can read the rest of the FAQ\\'s about Medical Amnesty [here]( \\n If in doubt, ASMSU, the student body government has lawyers on hand who can answer your legal questions and/or represent you if you do get an MIP. Also, get to know your RA to see if they are super strict before having a dorm party.

In the Parliamentary system of rule, one normally has more than two major political parties. The other main difference from what Americans are used to, is that the executive leadership of the country (Prime Minister/ President) derive their legitimacy from the legislature, and are often voted in by the legislature, not the people directly. \\n Assuming you're American (sorry if you're not), it would be if we split our two main parties into multiple ones. If you've ever looked at an election ballot, you will see that there are those who run on different party platforms: libertarians, greens, independents, and others. Because of the way our party system has evolved, there has been little opportunity for the minor parties to gain any traction. \\n But, say for example, we had people running under the Tea Party platform, the Traditional Conservative platform, Libertarian platform, Traditional Democratic platform, Green platform, and Independent platform. In order for any legislation to be passed (even that which only requires a simple majority, 51%) certain members would have to agree with those of a different party to vote the same way. Most of the time though, in the parliamentary system, they build formal coalitions, where voting differently from your coalition happens rarely. \\n For more info, Wikipedia is actually quite useful.

[Here]( is the analysis that actually explains the law. \\n Since the analysis was published, the legislature went back and put in some new limits. Those include only being allowed to light fireworks the day before, the day of, and the day after specific holidays. Additionally, we provided more room for local governments to make regulations/ ordinances regarding using fireworks during the three day period of which they are allowed to be used (see [here]( \\n I have spoken with local governments telling them it\\'s up to their police departments to enforce the rules.

Unless of course, you can actually see your neighbor lighting off fireworks illegally or against local ordinances, the police can\\'t do much about it. \\n So yes. At this point it is up to local governments to enact ordinances restricting the use of fireworks. It is also up to your local police departments to enforce said ordinances. You want to control firework use in your local area? GREAT. Go get involved in your city council meetings, township board meetings, or whatever other governance structure you might live under.

No, I was not as active in college, but my body was also at a different stage, and my hormones were changing as well. If I tried to lose weight now, it would probably decrease my chest size by a cup, but after that the weight loss would most likely come from other parts of my body (I don\\'t know for sure though; just based off of how my mother lost weight).']": "- Automobile industry and sales regulations\n- German language and culture\n- College advice and experiences\n- Political systems and coalition building\n- Firework regulations and local governance\n- Student resources and financial tips\n- Women's health and sports", "['Makes interlaced gifs smaller.

From what i understand on the subject, admittedly very little, there's a wide variety of factors some memories feel more permanent, such as the emotions and senses stimulated during the conception of a memory. But the truth is no memories are truly permanent, and even the most vivid ones often change in the minute details. For example you might remember (purely hypothetical) the day your dad took you hiking and what the weather was like the general location etc, but when prompted you would probably not remember the color of the shoes you wore, or the brand of sunscreen you put on that day, however you remember the scented creams you applied smelling faintly of lavender. There are countless studies proving that the sense of smell is one of the strongest senses in relation to memory. \\n This being said there are many subconscious and conscious cues at work (far too many) that influence both how the memory was perceptively remembered and the faint factors which lead you to remember that instant over the instant following or preceding it.

At, or within, your optimal range you can hit perfectly, for full damage (providing your tracking can keep up). At optimal + falloff, you can hit for up to 1/2 damage. At optimal + falloff + falloff +1m you will miss every time. \\n Compare the Heavy Neutron Blaster II (optimal: 3600m, falloff: 5000m) to the 425mm Autocannon II (Optimal: 2400m, falloff: 9600m). Ignoring skills, other modules, or ammo modifiers, yes, the Neutron Blaster will do full damage for an extra 1200m. However, the Neutron Blaster does half damage out to up to 8600m, and no damage by 13601m. Meanwhile, the 425mm Autocannon does half damage out to 12000m, and no damage by 21601m. \\n Get the skill that gives you a 5% falloff bonus to 4 (for a 20% total bonus), and it pushes the Blaster's possible engagement range out to 15600m. Meanwhile, it'll push the Autocannon's possible engagement range out to 25440m. Throw in a 20% bonus from having a ship skill to 4 (as many autocannon boats, and Gallente blaster boats have a 5% falloff bonus, iirc) and the Blaster maxes out at 17.6km, while the Autocannon can reach nearly 30km. \\n In each case, the autocannon does half damage (optimal + falloff) out to roughly where the blaster stops doing any damage at all (optimal + 2falloff + 1).\", \"For a set of knock-around-the-house knives, sure, if I didn't have whetstones. \\n If I caught someone putting a knife I had spent any sort of money on through one of those, I would break their hands, and for that amount of money, you can get several inexpensive whetstones, and do the sharpening work properly. \\n That sort of device is effective for lower-end knives, but it does tend to remove a great deal of material (relative to whetstones), shortening the life of the blade considerably, and it can't adjust to put different angles on different blades, nor do repair work.

Yes, of course. They also get support from other members. That\\'s what happens when you have two competing points of view.', 'Force thawing in hot water is generally discouraged (and also against many health codes). First of all, it guarantees that the surface and shallow parts of the meat will reach temperatures deemed dangerous prior to cooking. It may not seem like a big deal, but between 4 and 60 degrees centigrade, salmonella doubles its population every ~15 minutes, slightly slower at say 5 degrees, fairly faster at 59 degrees. Force thawing in cold water also presents this risk, but the generally accepted practise is that colder water (health code in Ontario states under 21 degrees Centigrade) poses less of a risk than hotter water as the warmer the water (as long as it is under 60 degrees centigrade), the faster the bacterial growth and reproduction. \\n The risk you are taking by using warmer water is accelerating bacterial growth in your food. It SHOULD still be safe if you cook it properly, but you also increase the risk of bacterial contamination on other things it comes in contact with while raw (by increasing the bacterial count on the product itself). \\n For force thawing via microwave or cold water, the greater risk that we see happen frequently is the product reaches the temperature danger zone (TDZ) for a period of time, allowing accelerated bacterial growth, and then the product cools back to refrigerated temperatures (upon being returned to the fridge or re-frozen) and the bacteria go dormant or form spores instead of dying. If using the meat for anything cooked less than well-done, this can lead to hazardous amounts of bacteria surviving the cooking process. If the meat is contaminated with a spore-forming bacteria, the spores may even survive well-done temperatures, and then re-awaken after ingestion. \\n On top of that, hot-water thawing is discouraged because temperatures above ~40 degrees centigrade can start denaturing some proteins, and initiate cooking of the meat. In addition to the bacterial risk in this temperature range, you may end up overcooking and toughening the outer surfaces of the meat you are using, as you are effectively sous-vide-ing the meat when you use high temperatures.', \"Get her a couple Victorinox, and a basic couple of whetstones. Teach her /have her learn how to maintain that decent, but basic, set before you consider getting her something like a Shun, or even more expensive knives. Even expensive knives will be awful in 6 months if she doesn't learn how to maintain them. Seeing as you  can  eventually ruin a blade if you continually sharpen it poorly, it is much better to learn maintenance with a cheaper, but effective, blade before you upgrade to a more expensive blade. \\n I have a gorgeous Gyuto which by itself cost about half again more than my entire Victorinox set and knife roll. I didn't try sharpening it myself until I learned how to get the Victorinox set sharpened up like razor blades, consistently.\", \"Optimal range is a separate calculation than tracking. Basically, at up to your optimal range, you can do full damage, if your turrets can track fast enough. So, with a 5% bonus to a 100m optimal range, yes, you can do full damage out to 105m instead of 100m. \\n Tracking is a separate consideration entirely, and yes, it is harder to track things that are closer in. Tracking is based on the other ship's transversal velocity (and possibly also their sig radius). If they are farther away, they have to go faster laterally relative to your ship to maintain the same transversal velocity. The trade-off being (to orbiting closer) that the closer you orbit, the more agile your ship has to be to maintain speed. The importance of transversal velocity can also allow a smart pilot in a larger ship to kill a pilot orbiting them in a smaller ship. When they start to swing around the front or rear of your ship, just start your ship going in the opposite direction that they are, and punch your MWD. This will kill their transversal, hopefully allowing your turrets to track them and insta-pop them before they can fix their orbit.\"]": "Based on the user's reddit posting history, it seems that the user is primarily interested in the following areas:\n\n1.

[This post]( is where I originally posted info about it. \\n After another long week of development  Recall  users. I want to thank you all again for trying out the site and letting me know what you think. Many improvements and ideas came from the users here in this subreddit. \\n New Features \\n \\n Profile Page  - This one was probably the most requested features both directly as well as indirectly asking for featured that would require such a page. It's up now and you can go see your summaries, your favorites and the books you have added. \\n \\n Things that go along with the new profile page \\n \\n User Edit  - You can now edit your user \\n \\n Favorites  - You can now save summaries to your favorites list. These will show up on your profile page. \\n \\n View & Download Counts  - I am now tracking views and downloads to show off on the profile page. Also these can be used on the main page for new search options. \\n \\n Edit Book  - if you added a book, you now can edit that book if you made a mistake or want to add new info. \\n \\n \\n (side note: I was not able to link all books to the users who created them because I was not saving that data before now. So if you added a book and dont see it on your list in your profile and you want it there just PM me your username on the site and what book you added and I will link it up for you. Going forward this will be done automatically) \\n Other Features \\n \\n UI Update  - Most buttons how have text along with the icons. This should clear up some of the confusion going on at times. \\n \\n New Search Options  - The main search areas how have more options. Search by most view, or hot to see what people are looking at the most right now. Or search by most recently having added a new chapter. \\n \\n Requests  - You can now request a summary by searching for a book and clicking on the request count in the bottom left corner. Then summary writers or authors can search by most requested to see what the people want.  (perhaps in the future there will be a bounty system for fulfilling a request...) \\n \\n Featured Summary  A summary can be featured on the homepage perhaps to coincide with the upcoming release of a new book. This should highlight the summary and help users catch up on the series before a new release as well as help promote new books that are releasing soon. \\n \\n \\n There is still a big lack of content, but that will come with time. If we all start working on things, in a little while we can have an awesome tool we can all use. After this round of use from the awesome people here I plan on posting the site on many more subreddits and other places around the web to get more traffic and users contributing to make the most out of the site in the future. \\n Final note, the 'beta tester' flair will probably end soon so sign up now if you want that flair on your account.\", 'Recently I posted my side project website / web app  Recall  in response to [this post]( about getting back into a long book series after a hiatus and forgetting a lot of the details that happened in the previous books. \\n &nbsp; \\n I received a ton of amazing positive encouragement and feedback. So I started to work on all of the suggestions others gave me about the site and I think it is now in a really good place to share around a little more to see what people from other areas think of the it and to look for more feedback as well as more activity. \\n I think the readers of this subreddit would benefit and enjoy using this tool as much as other who have seen it so far so I wanted to share it with you.

Each chapter usually has at least one important idea or plot point otherwise why is it in the book. So for each chapter the user will fill out a very short summary of the important points. They can be as short or as long as you feel is needed. \\n \\n That being said the site is flexible to allow for basically any kind of summary you want to create. Want to only break down the book into a few sections? Go nuts. Call each section what you want and write what you want. Want to just have one block of text for the whole book? Nothing stopping you. \\n &nbsp; \\n The site is pretty new so there is a lack of content, [but if we each add a little]( here and there I feel that the site could be a great tool for everyone. Go do a search for your favorite book and see if it is in the system yet. If not, go ahead and add it in and start a new summary for it on your next read through. \\n A few cool features about the site: \\n \\n Users can  vote on each summary  (I wonder where that idea came from) so the best summaries will float to the top of each book. \\n \\n You can  export any summary as an ebook  to keep for later and add to your library so you dont have to search for it again when the next book in the series comes out. You can also  favorite summaries  to keep in a list on your profile page for easy access later. \\n \\n If you add each main character to the chapter you can then  sort the summary by character  and only see chapters where that character is involved. This also allows other users to search for the book by characters as well as book title or author. \\n \\n When creating an account on the site, if you leave the picture blank you will be assigned a random color and animal icon. They\\'re pretty cute, create a user and see what you get on your profile page. Or you can upload your own picture for a more personal touch. \\n \\n The site was built to be very mobile friendly. It should work great on any device. \\n \\n Request a summary  by clicking on the \"requests\" count on the bottom right corner of the book to add your vote for a summary of that book. Then you can search by most requested books and see what people want the most and possibly write the summary people are looking for and be a hero to many. \\n \\n View / Download count  See how many people are viewing and downloading your summaries on your profile page \\n \\n Flair  Certain milestones will add small icons next to your account picture to show off your contributions to the site. Currently you will get the \"beta tester\" flair for signing up and supporting the site from the very beginning. \\n \\n Verified Author  flair can be added to an author who provides proof that they are who they say they are. Then users can see that the author them self has written a summary on their own work. Michael J. Sullivan has started doing that for his book \"Theft of Swords\" on the site. Check it out  here \\n \\n Featured Summaries  There can be a featured summary on the home page to drive more people to get acquainted with the book or perhaps promote a new book in a series coming out soon by encouraging people to catch up on the series before the new book hits shelves. \\n \\n Save chapters as draft  if you started working on a summary, but don\\'t have time to finish it right away and don\\'t want users to see your unfinished work.

Overall, the user is interested in creating a platform for readers to contribute and access chapter summaries for various books.", "['Alright, I\\'ll bite. \\n First things first: as a gay male, my perspective on this is  very  constrained. I\\'ll never have to face the decision to keep or terminate an unplanned pregnancy, as either the father or (obviously) the mother. So my voice should not carry any special weight in the matter - I\\'ve never been there, and I never will. Someone in my position might well be opposed to abortion on personal, ulterior grounds: more infants available for adoption means a greater supply for gay couples who want a family, which is by far the easiest option for most men in my position. I disagree with this perspective, because it\\'s selfish and because it doesn\\'t consider the \"whole problem.\" I try avoid the former and succeed in the latter below. \\n So I\\'ll try to address this in the order which you proposed. It\\'s not comprehensive, but it\\'s long, so that will have to suffice. \\n 1) Policy should always take into account morality, or at the very least, ethics. However, in this case, it is morally unclear and ethically inconclusive about whether abortion is \"wrong.\" Then again, people like to pick fights about all sorts of things and defend it with morality, so we\\'re not going to be able to rely on consensus as a way to solve this particular problem. It\\'s a deeply held, personal belief - based on ethical and moral principles. Given that, and the strong feelings on both sides, I favor the freedom to choose one\\'s own morality: just as we have freedom of religion in the United States, we have ethical and moral freedom. I o not personally consider abortion to be immoral in many cases, and given that, I am more willing to support free elective abortion over restricted or banned abortion. More on that later. \\n 2) I think that as a society we should do what we can to reduce abortions, because it is  always  a terrible, difficult choice. I think that the best way to do it, however, is to reduce the  need  for abortions, not their availability, because . . . \\n 3) If we banned abortions or made them illegal, they wouldn\\'t go away - they\\'d just get more dangerous. Abortions happen for a variety of reasons - almost as many reasons as people get pregnant. The statistics on this are hazy (as are most statistics on illegal activity), but states with more stringent abortion restrictions sometimes have much higher cases of botched black-market abortions. This is less common in states where abortion is more freely available. So, in my mind, a bad on abortion or \"personhood\" law would almost certainly cause more deaths of would-be mothers, with little or no change in the actual demand for abortions  all other things kept equal . \\n 4) Comprehensive - and I mean  comprehensive  sexual education, mandatory for anyone who is sexually mature^1, with completely factual medical information, followed by fully legal, destigmatized, and heavily subsidized prophylactic or birth-control methods. This means no taking our kids out of sex-ed, no \"we don\\'t believe in modern medicine,\" and free condoms/IUDs/hormone cycle pills for anyone who wants them and for whom it is medically safe to prescribe them to - for starters. There\\'s been some promising research on male contraceptives as well (reversible ones, even, which is a nice change from vasectomy), so if those get past FDA approval, I\\'d have them free as well. Unfortunately, most of these are non-starters: few people support a national curriculum for anything, much less for something as charged as sex ed, and apparently Americans don\\'t favor universal healthcare, much less  free  universal healthcare. Sad thing is, this won\\'t completely end the problem: unplanned pregnancies even happen when people are on birth control or are using condoms, so there might still be abortions. \\n 5) Yep. If it\\'s a supreme court decision, it can be overturned. The current court is exceptionally conservative, and not exceptionally deferential to precedent. Since there\\'s been a slew of new abortion laws at the state level recently, I imagine they will have opportunity if they want it. There\\'s some discussion about the politics of the Supreme Court recently (since the ACA ruling) but in my opinion, unless the composition of the court changes, a repeal of RvW is possible. I can\\'t honestly give odds, but it\\'s not zero. \\n 6) Not sure, honestly. Writing a law is one thing, and enforcing it is another. If all pregnancies are monitored for termination, for example, then it  will  run up against the legal logic of Roe v. Wade, which will force a SC challenge and a slew of injunctions back and forth. If it\\'s merely a ban on abortions . . . it might go through, with just as many injunctions and back-and-forths and probably a visit to the SC. If it\\'s a ban on birth control and condoms, there will be revolts and possibly a revolution. (I jest, but shit would go down - there\\'s a whole lot of sexually liberated feminists out there who would mobilize against such a law, IMO, even in more conservative states.) \\n 7) Honestly, I don\\'t think so. I\\'m a weak federalist in general, and prefer national (read: general) solutions to policy programs over state (read: specific) solutions in this case in particular, because the issue at hand is largely the same wherever you are in the country. It also creates a shady environment where people can be prosecuted for breaking a law in a state, when the violation occurred in a different state where an abortion was legal (though only in edge cases, like the abortion-tracking personhood amendment above - I\\'m pretty sure it\\'s not a problem in less restrictive legal environments). Moreover, it\\'s bad policy in general - it imposes exponentially greater costs on the poor and the least powerful in society, because they lack the resources to move to places where laws align with their needs and views. All this said, I\\'m not a lawyer, so I lack the base of information from which to make a reliably informed opinion. \\n 8) OK! The fun part! \\n \\n Comprehensive Sex Ed. It\\'s science, it\\'s medicine, it\\'s education. It\\'s how we beat smallpox and polio, it\\'s how we can keep kids from getting pregnant before they want to be. It\\'s how we can get non-kids to avoid it, too.^1 Take your  pills, wrap your tool, and have a frank and awkward discussion about sex the next time you go for a checkup. This also goes a good way towards destigmatizing sex, which is a noble goal in itself, in my opinion. \\n \\n Birth control is a better solution than abortion. I agree with the HHS ruling that it should be paid for without copay by insurance companies, and think that the legal work-around provided to religious employers is both elegant and perfectly acceptable as a compromise. I wish it wasn\\'t necessary, but given that it is, I\\'ll work with it. \\n \\n No abortion clinics. It singles out women who seek out abortions, and charges the decision. I don\\'t know if this will encourage or deter abortions, but it will remove the mania around the decision - allowing people to make more rational choices. The problem here is that a lot of hospitals are religious, and refuse to perform abortions - as do a lot of doctors. I think this is horse ** , but it is their right as private businesses to do so, even if I disagree. But abortion clinics are dangerous targets for bombings, assaults, and threats - and it adds unnecessary social and psychological stress to a decision that is hard enough as it is. There might have to be some leeway on this, but as a rule I think it\\'s a bad way to go about it. \\n \\n This isn\\'t really abortion policy per se, but I\\'d like to see a conception-to-eighteen care system. If women knew that they could give up their children to a system that could take care of them - from their first heartbeat to high school graduation - then I think that fewer people would choose to abort a pregnancy. This would mean  massive  reform of family care law and a slew of other reforms, but I think it\\'s the only policy \"alternative\" to abortion in the case of a desperately unwanted pregnancy. There\\'s also a lot of moral hazard here - after all, that\\'s nine months of free medical care for the mother, and people have done stupider stuff to get health insurance. \\n \\n \\n 9) This is a deeply, deeply charged debate. No matter how rational a solution is, if you disagree with the two poles in our current national debate, you\\'re wrong according to someone. I think that abortion politics will be with us as long as the religious right and feminism are, and I don\\'t see either of them dying soon - and any victory for one could well mean a resurgence of the other in protest.', 'Intriguing.

In a perfectly free-market environment, this might be the case, but since frictionless, perfectly-informed and barrier-less markets do not, and cannot, exist, we should take this assertion with some salt. As is occasionally the case with theoretical economics, the conclusion is based more on flawed premises than on the intervening logic - I say this as a critique, not an insult. There are numerous barriers to executive officialdom, most having nothing to do with merit, and the market itself is highly distorted by both artificial scarcity, and by unusual input factors and incentives on the behalf of shareholders, corporate boards, companies, and executives. \\n There is probably some stickiness to the matter that you dismiss here: increases in state-level high-income tax rates (the tax rate on the wealthiest tax bracket) can be seen as de-facto exogenous restrictions on executive (or other high-end) pay; the theory is that companies, in order to retain a competitive edge and attract top talent, will relocate their entire legal superstructure to another location. This also assumes that \"top talent\" will follow accordingly, and only live - or want to work - in places with overtly favorable conditions. While accepted as common wisdom among economists, it doesn\\'t really stand up to common sense: a lot of extraordinarily wealthy people live in relatively high-tax companies, as do extremely wealthy and profitable companies (which is why central Europe is not an economic wasteland). This indicates that companies and executives simply don\\'t care quite enough to uproot their entire \"legacy\" (legal, financial, and social affiliations, physical sunk costs, and relationships, loosely defined) at the drop of a hat to achieve maximum utility. So companies aren\\'t, for some reason, likely to flee to Switzerland or Somalia if their markets are in the U.S. and it\\'s a bother to do so in the first place. Besides, it\\'s cheaper to lobby for decreased regulation or to buy a PR company to demonize political opposition - and they\\'re sounder economic investments than Mogadishu real estate. \\n NOW, back to (kinda) the matter at hand: most of the norms of executive pay are relatively recent in conception. Boards of directors don\\'t like to set executive pay below market averages, which means that compensation almost always goes up over the long run. Countries with different management schemes produce different outcomes: CEO pay in Japan is considerably lower than in the US relative to \"worker bee\" pay, with more-or-less indiscernible results. The actual value-added of CEOs is also questionable: managerial outcomes are enormously techy and subject to outside stimuli, and what works well for a CEO at one company in one industry might be disastrous for the same CEO in a different environment, much less at a different time, place, and stage of life. The situation wherein CEOs leave their jobs often for better-paying slots in other companies - or industries - is largely manufactured: companies dislike hiring executives from their competitors (since retributive hiring of one\\'s own employees can lead to an expensive price war), and thus hire from similar or related, but non-competing industries. To attract talent, the theory goes, they offer a premium. Because this is exactly the fashion in which CEOs got their current job, they are typically willing to follow the buck - strictly as a matter of improving their scorecard, increasing their net worth, and their chance of getting into the Fortune 500 (or whatever club matters to them). To keep a CEO, companies therefore have to continuously increase executive compensation - and even when a CEO leaves, there is pressure to \"trade up\" to a better model. This creates a self-perpetuating positive feedback loop: once a company is firmly established, it continuously generates higher and higher wages (with growth well above inflation, so long as CEOs aren\\'t categorically stupid) without any reference to actual performance in the job:  merely to keep someone in the big chair for more than a few months,  boards have to pay them well, with the expectation that they will probably do even better next year. \\n To the credit of CEOs, most of them resist the temptation to just ride the wave and not work at all, but instead work their assess off in an attempt to improve their company - or at least do everything in their power to achieve goals that would justify compensation to their nominal bosses, the board of directors. Ditto for almost everyone below them - business work because people work hard, and most of them earn their pay. It\\'s a matter of whether the CEO deserves more credit, or the worker actually making the widget. \\n Ultimately, businesses are collaborative ventures. Excessive CEO pay occurs when the CEO is granted credit by shareholders for the performance of the venture as a whole. This credit is sometimes - I would argue, often - in excess of the CEO\\'s actual involvement in the performance. Most CEOs are so far removed by management chains from the actual nuts-and-bolts of the business that they are actually incapable of managing them: IIRC the CEO of Bear Stearns wasn\\'t fully informed of the cash flow problem the firm was experiencing (which ultimately led to its end as a Wall Street institution) until the Friday night meeting called to deal with the crisis. One section of his firm had found it increasingly difficult to get their creditors to roll over their short-term debt (the Wall Street equivalent of borrowing a fiver to pay for pizza, with a promise to return it with interest tomorrow). That meeting eventually exposed how screwed Bear really was: nobody would lend them money without government support. So should the CEO be considered responsible for the crisis - which was not solely his fault, or anyone else\\'s, on an issue which would have been inefficient for him to micromanage anyway? (ref 1) \\n The parable here is that the CEO isn\\'t always the indispensable god-king of a company: sometimes, he\\'s just a figurehead, especially outside of the outliers like Steve Jobs or Jeff Bezos or Pickyour Favoritebusinessman. The question, then, is whether it\\'s a sound investment to make the figurehead out of platinum and rubies, or out of well-crafted and beautiful, but equally functional and exponentially more thrifty wood or steel. So it kinda depends on what you want out of a CEO, and what you consider to be the better bargain for the company in the long or short run - but these are rarely the kinds of discussions that drive CEO hiring and firing, which is itself the larger problem. \\n IN SHORT:  Companies don\\'t just relocate because one aspect of the business climate is unfavorable in one fashion or another; such companies would be too sensitive to market conditions to survive everyday fluctuations, much less structural ones, and could only ever exist in perfectly free markets - which do not exist. CEO pay is an emergent outcome of several different unusual functions, and probably doesn\\'t reflect actual performance as well as people like to think it does.', 'I\\'d be careful of the anti-Western think. Russia has trouble with that category, since it\\'s ambiguously Western and Asian at the same time. Heck, for a while there in the 19th Century, Russia was the \"savior of the West\" for helping to defeat Napoleon.

After all, the largest voice againt LGBT rights in Russia is the (thoroughly Chrisitian) Orthodox Church.

I haven\\'t had one negative reaction.  Not. One.  From old friends in high school to people I only knew for a summer, they\\'ve been universally supportive. \\n One of my best friends is extremely attractive. Unfairly so. I know pretty much for a fact that he doesn\\'t bat for our side, and has zero curiosity about what it\\'s like over here. But we laugh and chat about everything from geeky-as-fuck scifi novels to deep philosophical and political issues to sex, and he\\'s stayed over at my place whenever he needs to be in my neck of the woods early the next day. He\\'s fucked girlfriends in my basement on two separate occasions (which is not quite as private as it sounds, since that\\'s where the front door of the house is - my house is weird), and appears to delight in wandering around his apartment (that he shares with two other straight men) shirtless. Honestly, we\\'re sometimes astonished (well,  they  are, I\\'m mostly just disappointed) that he wears pants at all. We\\'ve commented on how lucky I am to be gay (the ForeverAlone issue notwithstanding) because my options for geeky, freaky, fun mates are a lot broader than his (though he seems to be doing just fine as far as I can tell - I think he just wants more gaming partners around, and doesn\\'t care how much fucking I have to do to make it happen). \\n Me and a (straight female) friend invited him and his girlfriend at the time as our double-date to the prom - I took his not-girlfriend, and he took our friend. This worked out great, because at the time, he was technically dating an intern at his organization, and when he saw one of their coworkers at prom, we immediately played musical dates to throw off the scent. (He was later informed that almost everybody suspected  something  was going on, but since nobody caught them  in flagrante delicto  while they were at work, nobody had anything but rumor to base this on.)

Sawyer).  In it, an alien that believes in Intelligent Design uses an argument based on how perfect water is for several different qualities that most other compounds lack. \\nHere I quote from the book, and apologize for spelling errors as I transfer over from my kindle:\\n\"Although water seems chemically simple--just two hydrogen atoms bound to an oxygen--it is, in fact, an enormously unusual substance.  As you know, most compounds contract as they cool and expand as they heat.  Water does this, too, unitl just before it starts to freeze.  It then does something remakable:  it begins to expand, even as it grows colder, so that by the time it does freeze, it is actually less dense than it was as a liquid.  That is why ice floats instead of sinking, of course.  We are so used to seeing that, whether it is ice balls in a beverage or a skin of ice on a pond, that we usually give it no thought.  But other substances do not do that:  frozen carbon dioxide--what you call dry ice--sinks in liquid carbon dioxide; a lead ingot will sink in a vat of molten lead.\\nBut water ice floats--and if it did not, life would be impossible. If lakes and oceans froze from the bottom up, instead of the top down, no sea-floor or lake-bottom ecologies would exist outside equatorial zones.  Indeed, once they had started freezing, bodies of water would freeze solid and remain solid forever; it is currents moing unfettered beneath surface ice that pro motes melting in the spring-- that is why glaciers, which have no such currents beneath them, exist for millennia on dry land adjacent to liquid lakes.\\n[...]\\nThis strange expanding-before-freezing is hardly the only remarkable thermal property water has.  In fact, it has seven different thermal paramaters, all of which are unique or nearly so in the chemical world, and all of which independently are necessary for the existence of life.  The chances of any of them having the aberrant value it does must be multiplied by the chances of the other six likewise being aberrant.  [...]\\nNor does water\\'s unique nature end with its thermal properties.  Of all substances, only liquid selenium has a higher surface tension than does water.  And it is water\\'s high surface tension that draws it deeply into craks in rocks, and, of course, as we have noted, water does the incredible and actually expands as it freezes, breaking those rocks apart.  If water had lower surface tension, the process by which soil is formed would not occur.  More: if water had higher viscosity, circulatory systems could not evolve--your blood plasma and mine are essentially sea water, but there are no biochemical processes that could fuel a heart that had to pump something substantially more viscous for any appreciable time.\"', \"Ohio State, having for some unknown reason scheduled their season like they didn't want to play in the national championship this year, has still managed to hold on to their #3 spot in the rankings this week.  Part of that is because Baylor has played one less game, but I believe that most of it has to do with the mentality right now that the Big XII is just not that good. \\n Which brings me to my main point:  Texas losing early in the season to  BYU and Ole Miss (at 20 point deficits) ruined the entire image of the Big XII.  Them rallying in the mean time and finding that they have a run game has hurt, rather than helped the situation. \\n On top of all that, we still don't have enough teams in the league to have a Big XII championship, which doesn't help us as far as getting into these title conversations, either.

The Paradigms did allow me to choose the general role of my NPCs, but if I switched one to Saboteur, for instance, with the intent of getting a hasted enemy to slow down a bit, often I would be granted a full time-wasting gamut of every other debuff possible before Slow or Dispel came out, often to the point where I would die to the fast monster. \\n The reason I was mad wasn\\'t the system, it was my total and complete lack of control over it.

I have AT&T as my service but im looking to buy the T-Mobile one and have it unlocked. The reason i want the T-Mobile one is for the bootloader unlocking ability. I plan on immediately removing the LG build and installing TWRP and CM12. Im quite used to the modding scene so this should be easy. Which brings me to my last question. \\n How is CM12 doing? How is the stability,performance,camera performance etc? Anyone using a T-Mobile variant on AT&T experience any unique issues? I really appreciate the help fellas.', \"So some context, I've always been a hardcore android fan. Since the G1 until the Nexus 6 I've had them all. But over the past year I have lost interest because of the amount of bugs in android and generally I don't like where the platform is heading. So I dove into the iOS ecosystem and I hate to say it but I loved it. I loved the polish of the OS the polish of the apps and the camera. I also loved the level of detail they put into everything from cases to apps to experiences to battery life.  To me android has been on the up and up but never enough to make me want to switch back from my glorious iPhone 6 Plus. Not even the almighty Galaxy S6 could make me switch back. That was until I got my LG G4. I can't believe the amazing feel in hand to the performance to the polish and oh my goodness the camera.

Its laggy, it drops frames, it cant keep a lock on to save its life and the image quality can vary so much that it makes me forget about using the camera. HDR+ while great, takes so long to take an image that the opportunity is lost by the time it snaps the image. Same can be said for the non-HDR+ mode since it constantly seeks for focus. \\n Its not all bad however.

To top that off it would also have a varying degree of a pinkish hue. This was what drove me crazy the most. I happen to be overly sensitive to the color shift and i would not be able to enjoy the device for long periods of time. \\n The second issue that was present on at least 5 devices was the overly rattling vibrator.

Ideally, you would have  one  router, as many bridges as necessary (the number of physical connections minus 1, in your case---two---ethernet, coax, and wifi - 1), and as many switches as you need to get the job done. But I digress from the solution... \\n First, set your SMC IP to 192.168.1.1 and subnet to 255.255.255.0. Leave DHCP on with a range of 192.168.1.50-200 (the important part is that you leave a little open at the beginning so your other \"router\" can sit there). Then set your Linksys IP to 192.168.1.2 and the subnet to 255.255.255.0. Turn off DHCP on the Linksys. Plug the cable from the SMC into an open \"lan\" port on the Linksys. Now both devices are on the same network. If you want to change wifi settings, you need to go to the Linksys IP.']": "Based on the postings, it appears that the user is interested in the following areas:\n1.

My gut feeling - No, it isn't a question of resolution as much as mere size. I love the current display on my mini and really don't understand people that want a mini but refuse to get one until it gets retina. Well, I kinda understand, but I wasn't waiting for retina nor do I feel it needs retina. A better camera? Yes. \\n I'm long out of school and don't have the desire or need to read textbook PDFs. But I did a test for someone and we decided he needed a regular iPad since reading textbook PDFs was going to be a major requirement. \\n Basically I think about my iPhone 4. It is retina and while I can read a comic on it, it is painful since I would have to zoom and scan around each page. The iPhone is just too small for a full page comic. Now on my iPad mini I can enjoy reading a comic. Sure I may have to zoom here and there, but I wouldn't need to go frame by frame. While a regular iPad would be best for a comic, likely no need to zoom to read, an iPad mini works since it isn't all zoom and scan like the iPhone is. \\n The PDF page of textbook that guy sent me had a graphic, illustrated and labeled drawing at top half of page and then two columns of text at bottom half. While I could strain my eyes and view the image and read the text on my iPad mini, I wouldn't want to do that fifty times in a row. Or even five. To comfortably view the drawing I had to zoom in on just it. To comfortably read the text I had to do the same. That's at least one zoom and two or three scans per page. At least. \\n IMO that would slow me down if trying to seriously do some studying and generally piss me off. Sure it could happen and your eyes are likely better than mine and you may have better patience with the constant zooming and scanning around, but I wouldn't suggest a mini if textbook studying is a main task of it. Even with retina I wouldn't suggest it. Mini is just too small for such formatted PDF files. Now don't get me wrong, ePub files are great - font and such seem to be flexible, in that those look good on both my iPhone and iPad mini. Some regular books transferred to PDF are good, but it depends on formatting. I've seen a few that still are horrible on iPad mini but most are workable. But textbook PDFs are a different animal. Especially if double column text is standard. \\n An iPad mini is good to take notes with (depends, I'm writing this on my iPhone) and write with, I got pages and numbers and they feel good with the mini. And while I've been reading a lot off my iPad mini, it has mostly been casual ePub files like a few zombie books and such. Mini browses web great and is excellent with games, not too big or heavy yet not too small. iPad minis can do a lot but I wouldn't suggest textbook PDF as primary way of studying. Just too small physical screen.\", \"Not sure. Once bicycle cops stopped me since I had a drink with me on sidewalk between bars. My friend knew I had the joints in my cigarette pack so while the cops are talking to me he (he didn't have a drink so cops were not worried about him) asks me for a smoke - it was looking like I was going to jail. I handed him the whole cigarette pack. Cops didn't think anything about it. \\n Luckily for me I wasn't drunk (just had a drink in public) and cops knew from talking to me that I wasn't drunk - and as the cops were running my ID some chick stumbles by, obviously drunk.  Cops didn't get anything bad from my ID so they had me pour my drink out and went after the stumbling chick.\", 'The main reason I keep coming back is these lovely', \"Yep, building something for other car makers makes more sense than building a whole car. Like a battery system or entertainment center that other companies can use. \\n If Apple made a car, how many types would they aim for? A small hatchback, a mid sized sedan, an SUV, a truck... Most car companies have a whole lineup. \\n And one factor that drives Apple products is people that buy new and then sell after a year or two to buy new again - a strategy that works great with phones, music players, and such but such a strategy wouldn't with cars. I buy a new computer about every five years, a new phone every two or three years, but I kept my last car nine years (bought used) and my new car I just bought half a year ago I'm planning on keeping a decade. This is same reason Apple hasn't entered the TV market, people keep TVs for a long time. Apple likes products that people want to buy often and cars and TVs just don't have such turnover.\", \"I had an awesome cat that wouldn't beg, she would just grab my food. One of my first memories of her as a kitten was chasing her down as she was dragging a wrapped Taco Bell taco across the floor she snagged from the bag. When I moved back home after college with her I let her be an indoor/outdoor cat and one afternoon I saw her running from a neighbor's house carrying a slice of lunch meat, very cute imagine. Once on Thanksgiving she actually ate more turkey than I did. She loved people food. \\n The downside was having to put her down after eighteen years due to massive diabetes. While that is a great lifespan for an indoor/outdoor cat, I often wonder if my feeding her people food helped shorten her life. So that is the reason I don't feed my current cat people food. She won't beg but is often right there watching when we eat. I've even offered her a little but she doesn't seem interested in eating my food, just very curious to watch me eat. \\n I suppose dogs are a whole different animal. But I enjoyed the way my late cat ate people food, figured it could come in handy if we ever had to bug out due to a hurricane - with my current cat I have to make sure to include plenty of cat food with my hurricane bug out supplies. And it came in helpful while car tripping with her, I could stop at Arby's and feed both of us without bothering with opening cat food. She was a great travel buddy on my thousand mile trips between Indiana and Florida.\", 'I\\'ve got the 2011 11\" MacBook Air. Other than battery I suspect mine will last for quite a while. Batteries just don\\'t last forever. \\n I still have my 2002 12\" PowerBook. I had to replace HDD around 2006. The DVD drive broke around 2007. Battery has been replaced and needs replacing again. But the computer itself is still running just as good as it did a decade ago. \\n Sure, being so old and of PPC chip era it doesn\\'t do well in today\\'s world and has not had an OS X update for ages... But it still works after 13 years. Since the Air lacks a DVD drive and has a SSD rather than HDD, I expect a similar long life. The battery is the weak point but as long as it doesn\\'t swell up it should still work plugged into a wall. Since I plan on keeping it till it fails I expect to get the battery replaced in a few years. \\n But back to your question, when I buy a Mac of any type I expect to keep it as my primary computer for five years and longer as a secondary or backup computer. HDD\\'s will always fail at some point, especially internal ones that hold the OS. Air\\'s don\\'t have HDD and SSD\\'s are supposed to last a lot longer, rather than failing due to a physical/mechanical issue they will die after too much writing and rewriting, which would affect different people differently based on usage. But disk drives are not a huge issue to get replaced and people often replace them before they die to get more storage. Other weak point with laptops is the battery. Batteries won\\'t last forever no matter how much you baby it. My problem is I use my laptop as a desktop 90% of the time and my battery doesn\\'t get the exercise it requires to stay healthy. But like storage drives, Apple knows batteries don\\'t last forever and can easily replace them (but have made it very difficult for the average user to replace). \\n So while some hardware parts will die, they are expected to die and can be replaced. Other bits of hardware like logic board, RAM chips, CPU and GPU chips, cables, etc... Well they certainly won\\'t last forever but they can last for decades. I lot of variables such as usage, climate where used, lightning strikes, and others come into play. Most have internal fans and I could see those failing, but something like that wouldn\\'t kill the computer immediately yet would shorten its lifespan. My 2007 iMac died in 2012, a few months before my expected five years of heavy usage. HDD failed along with a RAM chip and the whole logic board. I\\'m pretty sure my usage of it killed it. I live in a warm climate and while the house has A/C, the room that the iMac lived in did not have a vent and so would be hotter than the rest of house. I\\'m betting I just used it too long in a hot room and cooked it. \\n But all that has focused on hardware. Let\\'s look at software and OS. I think the oldest macs that can run the current OS are from 2007 or 2008. So that\\'s six or so years of being able to run current OS. But at the point your Mac can\\'t upgrade to the newest OS X - it won\\'t magically stop working. It will still run whatever OS it has. At some point new software will stop supporting your older OS, but whatever apps you have on it would still run just fine, mostly. The hardest part with my 2002 PowerBook is the web. Hulu requires a newer flash than the software supports, so it certainly has limits on what it can do on the web. But it still has an old Pages and Numbers and Civ3 and an old SimCity and an old iMovie and iTunes and such. So sure, with software at some point you hit a wall where the web starts to have closed areas and new software just won\\'t function on it - but I still don\\'t consider that as a dead machine, just an old one. \\n And that leaves specs. Sad news, the Air\\'s can\\'t have RAM upgraded and you (and I) have a mere 4GB of RAM. That will help limit what it can do now as well as the future. Future software and OS will require more and more RAM. Hard to really say how that will impact you. Right now I\\'m fine with 4GB, I don\\'t VM and I\\'m rarely doing more than just a few things at a time. I don\\'t plan on buying a new Mac until 2017 and I suspect I\\'ll feel the pinch of lack of memory sometime in late 2016. It won\\'t kill the machine, but I won\\'t be as happy with overall performance and I am now.', \"Back in 2002 I had a Win tower I had built myself. It was nice, had good specs but I was unhappy with Windows (had done Windows since 3.0). I bought a PowerBook mostly cause I was curious what a non-windows machine could offer. It had weaker specs across the board against my tower, but I figured a laptop would be fun and OSX was worth a try. \\n Within a few months I tossed that tower into my closet and had the PowerBook on my desk plugged into my monitor. Even with weaker CPU and less memory it was far better than my tower. Since then I've only bought Macs, and far fewer than if I had stayed with Windows. \\n Sure each one cost more, but they have lasted longer and been a joy to use. I'm sure Win7 is better then XP, but Apple designs the hardware and writes the OS and they fit live a good glove. And if I have an issue - any issue, no doubt who I contact. No Toshiba blaming MS as MS blames Toshiba. I can make an appointment at an Apple store and they help me, hardware or OS or anything. \\n From 1997 to 2002 I went through four Windows computers from various manufacturers and built one myself. Since 2002 I've had a PowerBook (still alive), an iMac, and I recently bought an Air when the iMac died. I could have had the iMac fixed but I figured five years was a good run from it since I did have it running almost 24/7. You can buy cheap and often or you can pay for quality. \\n On my iMac I had a quad-boot option. Two versions of OSX, Win XP, and a Linux. I could run any program but I rarely booted into XP or Linux. OSX offered pretty much everything I required day to day. People that complain OSX isn't robust never really tried to push it. \\n As far as OSX, it stays out of my way and allows me better production than any Windows I had. I spend zero time fixing it and very few hang ups. It may not be for everyone but I prefer OSX to Windows by a large margin. And I also prefer Mac hardware over any other computer maker.

I'm not asking to be a jerk, I just don't think it would be a reform you'd want if you understood what it was and how it works. \\n You also realize that no one owes any debt to the Federal Reserve right? The Treasury maybe (which is an entirely different organization in an entirely different part of the government), but the Fed does not have the power to issue debt. \\n Minor note: Glass-Steagall wasn't repealed by GBL Act.

That's the point of linear regression, to see if there  might  be a correlation between to variables with a certain level of confidence. It's done in the real world all the time. \\n Further, I would bet a large amount of money that there are studies out there that show a correlation between GPA, work ethic, work performance, etc. In general, if you have a high GPA, you're more likely than not to have a strong work ethic, etc. There are, of course, exceptions to this, but a standard normal distribution would most likely prove this to be true.\", \"I started a company that's in the process of trying to become an SEC approved funding portal as defined by this Act. \\n That being said, I obviously think it was a good thing overall. It's going to be much easier for companies to raise money. However, I think it's also going to be much more difficult find good investments. There's a chance that it might fuel a bubble similar to the Dotcom bubble in the late 90's/early 00's. That's  if  it takes off. I have some doubts that it will really change the landscape a whole lot. Even though it's now legal, you still don't see startups, hedge funds, etc. soliciting investments. At least I don't. \\n Some of the relaxing of SOX requirements is interesting, but I don't think that really does anything but just defer the inevitable. There are quite a few private companies that are already SOX compliant simply because if they go public or get purchased by a public company, that can be a big advantage. \\n The increasing of shareholders of record from 500 to 2,000 is irrelevant really. One shareholder of record can sell portions of their interest to as many people as they want (See: Goldman Sachs and Facebook). \\n Making equity investments in startups available to regular Joe's is a good thing overall. It allows the possibility that someone making $50k per year to invest in a company that could, in the long run, boost them up a tax bracket or two. The flipside of that is that I still believe most of the US to be financially illiterate. There's a possibility of abuse. The SEC is currently writing rules to try and stem that, but there will still be people who do it. Hopefully it's not too bad. \\n Lifting the ban on general solicitation is, in general, a good thing. For startups I think this might be advantageous, but won't be used very much. Part of the reason startups choose the investors they do (if they're smart) is for what value that person or people bring to the table besides cash. If I'm a startup and I need some money, I'm giving up a portion of my baby to someone. I want to make sure that person is smart and on the same page with me. I'm not going to settle for just anyone. It's important to remember that even if that person has one share, they still get a vote and a say in how I run my company.\", \"Unless you've been approved for writing naked calls, your brokerage likely won't allow this. You could do this between two regular trading accounts if you put the shares to cover in an ESCROW account. \\n Essentially, you're not doing a covered call. You own stock in one account. You'd be writing a naked call in the other. In order for you to deliver if called, you'd have to transfer the stock from your IRA to your regular brokerage account which may be against brokerage rules or not allowed under law. If it could happen for some reason, there'd be tax penalties.\", \"It depends on the state, but in general, I'm going to say 'probably not.' \\n If it's just a relationship, then unless the other person has their name on the deed, mortgage, etc. they probably don't have any claim to the property. That's assuming they haven't lived together long enough to be considered in a common law marriage (I'm not sure how often those things happen to be honest.) \\n Now if they're married, it certainly depends on the state. The state I live in is a community property state. Essentially, and purchase made after getting hitched means that each party to the marriage owns half of the asset. There are a few exemptions like if the house was purchased before the marriage or if it was inherited (regardless of when the marriage occurred). \\n In general, without the other person's name on some kind of deed or contract or mortgage, I think any payments would probably be viewed as rent.\", \"Depends on what state you live in. There are Tax Deed states and Tax Lien states. The two are different. \\n In a tax deed state, you show up to the courthouse and properties are auctioned off for the amount of the property tax owed. If you win the auction, you own what's called a tax deed. At a certain point in the future (in Texas it's 6 months), if the homeowner has not paid back the amount you paid (notice it's not the amount they owed... we'll get there in a second) plus 50%, then you can legally have the property deed transferred to you, have the sheriff evict the previous homeowner and you own the house free and clear. \\n In a tax lien state, you buy the right to the debt. At that point, you can make reasonable attempts to collect, but I don't believe you can ever own the property outright. If the homeowner were to file for bankruptcy, you're pretty low on the totem pole for getting your money back. \\n Here's how I've seen it work in Texas: \\n Any property worth anything will get bid up to pretty close it's tax appraisal value. For example: \\n Home assessed at $100k\\nProperty tax $5k \\n Great deal right? You can buy a home that is assessed at a hundred grand for only $5,000. Except there will be at least one or two other people there who have the same idea. I've seen deeds for those kind of homes go for as much as $95k. \\n The money is not made on flipping real estate though. At least not how it's made for any serious investor. There are two ways that I've seen to make money: \\n 1) Earlier when I pointed out that the homeowner had to pay back the amount the bidder  paid  and not the amount of property tax past due? That's why many of these guys/gals bid it up so high. In the above example, you could easily pay $5k and you'd get back either $7,500 or a house. But! If you bid it up to even $50k, then you either get $75,000 or a house. So it's in the investor's best interest to bid the price up. The counties that do these auctions aren't allowed to make a profit though, so the excess paid goes into a fund (in the $50k example, $45k will go into this fund) that the homeowner can request back. However, the homeowner, who couldn't afford to pay the $5k originally now has to cough up $30k ($5k plus $25k interest). Fat chance of that happening. That's where strategy two comes in. \\n 2) What many of the investors I've seen do is buy the deed only on a mortgaged home. The reason is because there's now another party interested in the property - the owner of said mortgage. Notice that earlier I noted that in tax deed states, after the repayment period has ended, you own the house  free and clear . The reason is because of an interpretation of the law that hasn't really ever been challenged. Because the government has the priority when it comes to liens, that right gets transferred to the person who buys that debt from the government. This means, that after the repayment period has passed, the purchaser of the debt/deed has the first right. Your right of ownership is above that of banks. What I've seen many people do as the repayment date is approaching, is go to the bank that owns the mortgage, let them know that you are about to own their house, and banks will (90% of the time) pay you the back property taxes + 50%. The reason is that if they lose the home, they lose any remaining principal. If they own the home, then at least they can sell it or auction it off and get something back. Even if the home has been foreclosed on by the bank and sold to someone else, the owner of the government debt has first right. \\n NOTE: This is how it works for tax deeds in Texas only. You should contact someone in your state to see how the laws differ. You should also have a good lawyer because deals can (be expected to) go sour because you're taking someone's home away from them. And last thing.... every county that I've looked at in Texas requires payment either on the spot, or by the end of the day via certified check, cash or letter of credit from a bank.

When the Galaxy Nexus came out I desperately wanted it but the $700 price point was killer, so I was forced to sell it. My father has a Nexus One (and probably won't get rid of it for a few more years - he's one of those 60 year olds who never gets rid of their tech) and every time I see it I recall the fond memories I had with it. I don't regret selling it for the Galaxy Nexus, but I wish I didn't have to. With the Nexus 4 being $350 (and me just having more money to spend - hooray internships) I plan to keep my GNexus as a backup. While it doesn't have the same effect (the Nexus One was my first android device, after all) I'll still have good memories with it.... \\n Not the Nexus S though.

Yes it would take time, but not nearly as much as the solution you've created. The only way I would see this as not being a better solution is if Play Music doesn't have some of the rest of your collection available online. \\n Adding more music would mean every time you get a new song you also add it to all access. I think Google would want you to GET that new music from the play store in the first place. That way it's first in your collection, then you download it from there to your computer. Your computer won't re-upload and make copies then. \\n So it's more convenient to buy from their store, but they don't require you to. \\n Sorry, but it seems like you are a rare case. I don't have that much music so I can't say I fully understand even if I think I do. With that said, it doesn't seem like there would be many people with collections as large as yours who would also pay for a service like this AND still buy albums. I would think that if you own that much music, you own the majority of what you want already (which is the benefit I see for All Access: getting an immediate large collection for those who don't have them already), so it would be cheaper in the long run to just buy individual album than to pay for the subscription service.\", \"Reddit Sync already lets you switch between card and list view, and list view is two-panel like option 1. \\n I didn't really consider that.

Literally half of the screen isn't being used. If the comment section switched to option 1 (with a back button press going to the three tile layout) I'd be fine with it, but as it stands now is just a waste. Further, on a 10in tablet (which I assume this is for, since there's no way three rows of tiles would look good on a 7in) there's PLENTY of space for both the cards and the post. Compare the screenshot. The post section is the same exact size, and the cards are BIGGER. \\n > With 1, when you click on the post you'll have the same preview image on the screen twice. How is that a better use of space? \\n You had me for most of your argument, but this one is pretty silly. Your argument is that clicking on a post will have the same preview image on the screen twice so option 1 is not a better use of space? So you're telling me that instead of having a scrollable list (that shows two or more posts already) isn't better than just filling that void with grey space?

The Nexus 5 hardware is great, and for the price it's quite a steal. But there will always better looking and better performing hardware. So while I might still pick up a Nexus 5-2 or whatever it's called (since I've owned every nexus), it doesn't mean I won't switch to another phone later. \\n For example, right now I use a HTC One (M8) GPE. GPE devices (with on screen buttons) and Moto X devices seem like good alternatives nowadays. But maybe if money is a concern down the line I'll stick with a Nexus. It really is a damn good phone.\", \"I have a hard time saying either at this point in the year. If I had to choose between the two I would go with the Nexus hands down, but I've had the phone for months and I'm gonna replace it with the next version. If I were you I'd wait until the next nexus and get that instead, since it should be announced in less than 4 months, and is guaranteed to be as powerful if not more powerful than than either of those phones. \\n If you really don't want to wait and just want something to play with, I'd say the Nexus. Simply because it's less of an investment for a brand new device, runs as smooth as the current s3 (and yes I know, when the s3 gets JB it'll be even more smooth, but right now that's not the case) and is guaranteed to at least get the next version of android almost immediately. This way, when the next nexus comes out you can be appeased by the update that the GNex will get. Then if you still want to switch to it you'll have $200+ dollars you saved by getting the GNex instead of the s3. \\n Also the S3 is no doubt a change from the s2, but I think that each new phone a person buys should head in the direction Google is going. They don't have to follow it directly, but they shouldn't ignore it either. Look at it this way: the changes from the s2 to the s3, what among them are  obvious changes from Gingerbread to ICS. The only obvious changes are 1: the data usage and settings and 2: the swipe-able notifications. The biggest part Samsung ignored was the multitasking and action bar. They slowed down operation by keeping the menu button and not adding the recents button. Honestly, if I didn't know about ICS I would swear the GS3 was running Gingerbread. I don't mean to turn this into an argument , though. The GS3 obviously has its strengths.\", 'I thought of a somewhat similar concept, but the problem that I keep facing (and you seem to ignore) is interactive apps.

You could say \"then you go into the app and press play\" but then that action becomes confusing. What would you show for music? The now playing song. But when you want to change songs (or change volume if you\\'re using music boss) then you have to first click into it. The only difference between these two screens becomes visible buttons. Maybe not a problem but it can become confusing. \\n I agree, cycling through watchfaces is silly. How often do we change our watchfaces? I think instead of cycling through faces as the app action in your paradigm, use it instead to go to the alarm app. Combine all of the time related features into one app. \\n But putting all notifications below is kinda heavy. I\\'d say just make notifications one app. How often do you go into the notifications app on your watch? Legit question. I rarely do. I simply look at notifications when they come. So why dedicate a entire area (beyond one screen) to them? \\n One more thing: instead of the back button going to the watchface (which is fine), why not make a zoomed out view of all apps (like the list we see when we press the middle button right now). So for those who just use two apps, they can simply be above and below. For those who have a lot of apps, switching between them is easier.', \"See, Android is about choice, but the choice isn't just blatantly in your face.

But this increase in hardware and software options isn't technically where Android should be considered open to choice. \\n Google makes the software a certain way. The way it works allows you to change a large part of the way it works. But they must limit options in order to maintain a certain level of performance and consistency.

When I\\'m playing competitive hockey, the day of the game I don\\'t want to go, I long for the day I am not playing anymore, I secretly hope the other tender will start or the game will be cancelled. When I get to the rink I force myself to think positive, reciting saves that I have made in the past, so I\\'m ok in the dressing room.

After is when you can sit back and appreciate a good game. Practices are fun too, you can make some sweet saves, give it to your teammates, get it from them, try some stuff you wouldn\\'t in a game. Same goes for non-competitive hockey, you can let yourself appreciate a big save, not worry about a bad goal.

Crops like barley are grown with the hope of selling them as a high grade commodity. Many factors can affect the crop reducing its quality to the point that it is only suitable as a feed grain. If we don't utilize this product as livestock feed the carbon footprint (which is significant with annual crops requiring tillage, synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, equipment, fuel,etc) is wasted with the crop providing 0 calories (and income for the producer)for the harm caused. \\n The carbon that is sequestered in pastures compared to the carbon (and methane) emitted from tillage required for annual crops. Grasslands can be more effective at sequestering carbon than forests when proper grazing management is applied. not to mention all the other damage tillage does to the local environment (erosion, increased evaporation intensifying droughts, destroying soil biology, killing rodents and the predators that feed on them) \\n Pasture and hay production is more resistant to failures. Annual crops fail due to droughts, floods, pests, etc, pastures are far more resilient to these factors. Being perennial, and a poly culture compared to and annual mono culture means make them more hardy and beneficial to wildlife. \\n Much of the pasture land that is used to feed cattle is not suitable for any other type of production. I say much as opposed to all because forests should not be clear cut and converted to pastures, that is a recipe for disaster. When we are talking North America, where the majority of our ag land is converted from grasslands, than all of the land that is pasture is not suitable for producing any other crops. Much of the land that is used for annual cropping is better suited hay or pasture, and converting it to perennial cover would provide multiple benefits. \\n Pasturing cattle is a closed loop system, requiring basically no outside inputs. The perennial plants do not require seeding, fertilizer is supplied, distributed and incorporated by proper grazing along with symbiotic relationships (N fixing legumes). FAR less water is required to produce hay or pasture (constant cover = less evaporation, poly culture of root systems accessing water from different horizons much of which is not accessible to annual crops, generally less water demanding plant species.) \\n I could go on, and may come back to add more, but the moral of the story is these studies are done with blinders on and a predetermined bias against livestock and pro vegetarianism. I would like to see soeone do one where they take into account livestock that is not produced in the worst possible way. \\n [\"]": "Based on the summarization of the reddit postings, the user's areas of interest are:\n1.

Cattle farming and agricultural practices", "[\"Band 41 is of the TDD-LTE spec of the LTE standard which utilizes unpaired spectrum with alternating time frames allocated to download and upload. The other popular LTE standard is FDD-LTE which uses paired spectrum for uplink and downlink. \\n TDD is utilized for unpaired spectrum bands like Band 41 which contains spectrum in the range of 2496-2690 mhz where they take say a 20 mhz chunk and alternate download time and upload time frames within that 20 mhz chunk. FDD-LTE would be something like 1910-1915 mhz allocated to uplink paired with 1990-1995 mhz allocated to downlink. \\n Wimax operates also in a TDD type of setup as well hence why some of the legacy Clearwire equipment (mainly Huawei) can support both Band 41 and Wimax at the same time with only a software modification. \\n Wimax is the other 4G standard that was brought up in the mid to late 2000s with a huge consortium supporting it worldwide but alas the adoption of LTE by Verizon and ATT and many other major carriers in the world made it not economical to develope and deploy said networks on a major scale. Most Wimax operators are now migrating to TDD-LTE. \\n In terms of the difference other than technology is the equipment quality both of the RAN (radio access network -- aka telecomm equipment) and UE (user equipment -- ie cell phones). Both have substantially developed since the last wimax phone (galaxy s2) was released in 2011. There's been 4 years of SoC and technological improvements to both types of technologies. \\n The new 8T8R equipment being deployed by Sprint are among the newest technology available in the market and extremely expensive and performs excellent compared to its predecessors like those RAN equipment of Clearwire. \\n In China, where they also utlize 8T8R Band 41 equipment (earlier models compared to the ones deployed by Sprint) they've found that they can utilize a new 8T8R setup to replace 2 to 3 of the older TD-SCDMA or whatever legacy setups they had. Put together that with advancements made in SoC and especially the phone radios and nowadays Sprint devices running on band 41 will almost always have better connectivity compared to the old wimax phones even when the Band 41 signal is being broadcasted by the old Clearwire equipment. \\n Apart from the phone and telecomm equipment developements there are also differences in backhaul (internet connection the the tower) and the channel widths of the spectrum with Clearwire Wimax runing 5mhz / 10 mhz chunks whereas Sprint / Clear Band 41 runs 20 mhz chunks. \\n Old clearwire sites have very variable backhaul and huge daisy chain microwaves which limited how much bandwith each site recieves. A lot of old clearwire sites were only backhauled somewhere in the 40-50 mbps range with each sector only giving off something like 20 mbps maximum. \\n On the other hand the Sprint equipment are running on somewhere in the 200-300 mbps backhaul range and somewhat scalable. \\n Even though many of Sprints sites cannot yet adaquetly support the full backhaul provisioning of a Band 41 20 mhz carrier (~80 / 16 mbps theoretical speeds) they still provide generally 40 mbps per sector which would be how a 5 mhz FDD-LTE carrier would be provisioned (AKA Band 25 / 26) and far exceeds what old clearwire sites were provisioned for the entire site.\", \"For immediate gratification? Get T-mobile. \\n If you need decent building penetration and am willing to pay then ATT. \\n Sprint is still in the midst of deploying Network Vision (4G & upgraded equipment) & TD-LTE (Clearwire LTE - ala Sprint Spark) and has still quite a distance to go. They'll be a viable around, from what I can see from my research and insider information, febuary-march time frame and when they do they'll come in with a bang with LTE on 800 mhz (building penetration equal to ATT & Verizon), PCS 1900 LTE (standard LTE freq), and TD-LTE 2500 (aka spark -- insane capacity & speeds ~90 mbps / 40 mbps DL-UL). \\n But that's still a bit away.\", 'They can\\'t do much for the speed drop unfortunately for a while until they can deploy the AWS-3 spectrum they won  from the recent auctions in a few years after they get a new LTE band standardized and equipmnet designed and deployed. \\n ATT speeds nationwide is actually falling pretty fast according to independent network testing sites like rootmetrics and speedtest netindex and so it\\'s not surprising you\\'ll see it in Sacramento too since they\\'re the #1 most subscribed cell carrier here. \\n Technical reason is their spectrum holdings are a mess compared to Sprint / Tmobile / Vzw and they don\\'t hold enough contigious spectrum to deploy \"wideband\" carriers (15x15 [~120 mbps/~25]/20x20[~140/30]) like Tmobile (15x15) or Vzw (15x15 or was it 20x20(?)... forgot). ATT here has deployed a 10x10 (~75 mbps DL/~20 mbps UL theoretical speeds) PCS 1800 mhz and a 5x5 (~37/12 theroetical speeds) 700 mhz B block lte carrier. \\nHell Sprint Spark (Band 41 [~80/15 theoretical]) could probably propel Sprint ahead of ATT later this year too if they ever get the additional LTE carriers up [Sprint holds enough EBS/BRS 2500-2600 spectrum for 5-6 20 mhz TDD-LTE carriers].', \"Sprint recently mass cluster launched the entirety of the Sacramento region on their new Samsung network vision equipment and have started reactivating the clear network to support band 41 tddlte ie spark. \\n The biggest issue in this market is that they own very little pcs 1900 spectrum and have only the option for one 5x5 band 25 lte carrier (37/12 max speeds) and one 5x5 band 26 lte 800 carrier which also have the same speeds but am not yet deployed. \\n This means their speed and coverage am and will continue to be spectacularly bad compared to the other providers on those frequencies which are more spectrum and larger lte carriers. \\n Speeds on 1900 lte averages 1-5 Mbps because of lack of cell site density and a number of cell sites still connected to old shitty t1 lines and not fiber or microwave like the other providers. \\n The only savior for sprint in the market is converting the clear network and deploying new 2.5 equipment which they are only beginning now since they fired up the network. This requires a triband spark phone which is the only type of phone anyone in this market should have or use because in this market sprint has 8x8 esmr 800 spectrum, 10x10 pcs a block 1900 spectrum + 5x5 pcs g block  lte spectrum. Whereas on 2.5/2.6ghz they lease or own about 140 mhz of spectrum which is not yet being fully utilized. \\n Once they deploy 800 and 2.5 over the majority of their sites then they'll become a real threat but until then they're improving but not really competitive.\", 'The Evo 4G LTE is the absolute worst RF performer for LTE on Sprints lineup. Absolute worst bar none. In fact, the Galaxy S3 released around the same time would be a good 5-8 dBm RSRP stronger than the Evo 4G LTE at the same spot. A Galaxy S4 is stronger than a GS3 with 8-10 dBm RSRP advantage over the GS3 which is almost 15-120 dBm RSRP stronger than the Evo 4G LTE (which is a LOT). \\n The recently released Nexus 5 is the strongest RF performer of any device on Sprint and is a 3-5 dBm RSRP stronger than the GS4 which makes it about 20 dBm RSRP stronger than a Evo 4G LTE at the same spot. \\n LTE starts to have noticeable performance issues once you hit -105 dBm RSRP and dies at about -110-120 dBm RSRP. \\n So at the same spot a Evo 4G LTE would be at 0 \"bars\" ir -110-120 dBm a recent released device like the N5 would be hovering at -90-95 dBm RSRP which is an excellent signal. Read [here]( for more on RSRP.', \"Coverage quality is where T-mobile falls behind. Sprint at least has a plan to work on their rural coverage whereas T-mobile will be neglecting the rural areas until they have done modernizing their current HSPA+ footprint which should be somewhere in 2015 before they can even turn to look at these areas. \\n Sprint is slow in areas where they have not underwent Network Vision upgrades. Like mindboggling slow ~sub 100 kbps + high pings. But virtually all of their markets have begun work now and is slated to be mostly complete by the end of 2013 to early 2014 in both urban centers and rural areas. In addition they have SMR 800 frequency for CDMA 1xA and LTE 800 which T-mobile has no answer to as they own no sub ghz frequency. The SMR 800 are slated to deploy beginning june 30,2013 with the shutdown of the Nextel iDen network. \\n But where T-mobile is great is that their HSPA+ speeds are amazing (if you get it) compared to Sprints legacy 3g network. You'll find  speeds in the ~10-20 mbps on average whereas sprint legacy 3g tops out at 3.1mbps which either hangs out around 1-2.5 mbps or ~100 kbps if in a non upgraded area.

Right now's probably not the best time to switch as it seems t-mobile is adequate for your data usage. Sprints legacy 3g with ~100-400 kbps speeds probably will not. \\n I would wait a month or two and let additional cell sites come online before swapping.

Pogba is one of, if not the most promising young midfielder in the game, Oscar established himself with Chelsea and the Selecao before turning 21. I doubt he will top 50 in 5 years. Maybe a few years after that but not in 5.', \"NFL and MLB are very different. The major difference is no salary cap on MLB, leading to juggernauts similar to European giants. Another big difference is the roster structure because in the NFL you carry 54 players and rotate them in a game while in baseball you carry somewhere around 25(?) players and play the same and rotate in between games mostly. The reason the NFL is standalone because the sheer number of players on a roster, which also leads me to point out the difference in how teams improve rosters. In baseball teams will send underperforming players to the minors, while the NFL has the roster cut system where you have to cut your roster down before the season begins, and many players in the NFL have non-guaranteed contracts, and only part of the money in big contracts Are guaranteed, which is unlike baseball where players will get 10 years and 200 million (all guaranteed). Now I'm going to go into the prospect and draft system. In the NFL players are required to have played for a college for 3 years or do something else for the equivalent time. By time players are drafted they are 21-23 years old(usually) and are much more ready to step in at the top level. In baseball a player can be drafted out of high school, but are not required to sign with the team that drafted them (in NFL it is the team's choice) and since teams draft 40 players (most of whom will never come close to making the major leagues) in one draft many will choose to not sign and opt for a college career. When they choose to play college ball they forfeit the ability to be drafted for 3 years. That means player can go professional straight out of high school or follow the NFL's 3 year system. Because of the size of the drafts, the  NFL's free agency system covers all playing abilities, while free agency only exists for top MLB players (not minor leaguers) who have played at least 6 years in MLB (unless the team allows them to become a free agent). The development of players is very different between the two due to the contrasting prospect systems. The final difference is in college. Division 1 football has 125 teams with 85ish players, while division 1 college baseball has 298 teams with 35 players, but take into consideration that 99.9% of NFL players go through the American college system while many baseball players join an organization straight out of high school or come from overseas. Another thing to consider when comparing soccer to American football and baseball is that both leagues completely dwarf all other foreign leagues (even Japanese baseball) and contain all the premiere talent for the entire sport.\", \"I FUCKING HATE THIS GAME.

The expectation is for him to replace Shaqiri if he leaves, and that he has potential to be an integral part of the first team in the future. One of the reasons Klinsmann decided he was worth bringing (besides the promise we all suspect) is that he has trained against some of the best players in the world and that experience in training will show despite a lack of game time with the first team. As far as future world cups the feeling is he could make the squad in 2018 if he develops well.

Also, he was outperformed by Arizona's redshirt freshman QB Soloman. \\n When comparing Mariota's loss to Barrett's, let's look at (adjusted) QBR, which is a very representative stat of a player performance throughout a game, taking into account clutch situations.

Harry was all like, 'it's the wizard media man, they're hiding it because they don't want mass hysteria', but everyone be like, 'pfft, you're a lying asshole Harry'. Sure enough, did voldemort return? Yup. Who had to clean it up? Harry. The same mother fucker that had been warning people for like a year without anyone believing his story. If anything the improper reporting and a ministry coverup was the reason it was such a big deal. Hell, they could have raised an army to fight the problem significantly earlier, thus negating the need for the first part of the deathly hallows movie (which I think we can all agree was a veritable turd sandwich). Fact is what CNN are doing is denying the existence of voldemort and are directly resulting in the creation of one of the worst films ever made. \\n One of this days Sagan's ghost and Bill Nye will rise up in defiance and sort out this climate problem, but what CNN are doing is making us sit through the media equivalent of The Deathly Hallows part I. \\n Those god damn assholes.\", \"Not me, but something we found out my grandfather had done before his death a couple of years ago now. \\n Basically when clearing out his house we discovered that he had been paying a pretty sizeable chunk of cash out of his account monthly. We thought it was potentially something sinister like extortion or possibly that he had another child after the death of his wife in 1988 (he never remarried or dated again). Anyway, so we track this train to Ukraine and all of us just think, what in god's name was he doing sending most of his pension to Ukraine for no good reason?! \\n Well... The guy was a doctor with the army for most of his career but after his wife died decided to just become a local physician in a pretty shitty area of Liverpool. Anyway, in the early 1990s a woman had come to his practice who was clearly here illegally with a child who had a chromosomal disorder (Turner's syndrome), club feet and generally hadn't done well on the post Chernobyl life lottery. Anyway, he saw them both and then was saddened to hear that they were returning to Ukraine. Essentially he decided that he wouldn't let this lady's child go unsupported and abandoned. Anyway, so we contacted this Ukrainian family and apparently he hadn't just had a minor role. Apparently he did everything from organise surgery for her with an orthopaedics collegue he met in the forces. Regularly flew the family to the Uk for visits and frequently visited Ukraine before he got sick. What really touched me however, is that this girl ended up being a pretty good pianist, sufficiently good to be offered a place at a prestigious school to follow her dream. The money that was going out every month was to cover all of her school fees and help her follow her dreams. After he died we got in touch with the family as I say, and now we go to visit the family every couple of years. \\n What really made it special though was just how laconic my grandfather was about the whole thing. He literally never mentioned it to us.\", \"Hang on, let me get this straight. So we are suppose to accept sub par customer service for our exorbitantly overpriced pizza? Why the hell should I pay about 3 times the going rate for pizza to get a dominos only to have my order screwed up? \\n Ok I accept that there are significantly worse problems in the world, but that's hardly an excuse for a company to shirk on its customer service in a 'that's good enough for them' type of way just because 'it could be worse'. How would you feel if a hotel gave you a seaman stained mattress with cigarette burns all over the place? You shouldn't complain right? Because at least you have a bed when millions sleep homeless every night. \\n I'm sorry, I see what you're trying to do here, but you can't compare a premium brand western pizza shop to a Red Cross mission. Frankly if I'm paying for pizza I expect the right order to arrive, when it is promised and not to taste like arse. \\n /rant.\", \"Not a police officer but someone who has (touch wood) never got a ticket. I find that if you're not an arsehole, you're not flaunting the law and you made an honest mistake, you'll frequently been allowed to go. One time when visiting a friend in Birmingham, UK about 40 of us were completely smashed and decided to start a massive fire and play music outside at about 4am in a residential area. My friend Ash had just lost a naked run bet (ie. he claimed he could do something and  couldn't, so his forfeit was to run naked around the block). The police turned up literally as soon as ash got naked clearly wasted, about to set off for his run. Even in a situation such as that, when we were clearly breaking the law, the police officer attending saw the funny side and just made us put out the fire, switch off the music and stop ash running bollock naked through the streets.\", \"You think paid safari hunting generates more income than all other safari trips? That's an interesting hypothesis but I'm not sure it's true, or just a way to justify big game hunting in the public imaginary. Lets explore this further anyway: \\n Firstly hunting in regions are thought to generate around $200 million annually. Now I know what you're thinking, this is Africa and that is a huge sum of money. Well, believe it or not the GDP and tourism industries in the region are significantly larger than people expect, hunting only actually only accounts for around 1.8% of tourist revenues. Furthermore, economists and local conservationists seem to have mixed feelings regarding the corporeal benefits generated by the revenues of trophy hunting, for example, \\n 'Local communities seldom benefit from big game hunting: \\nWe\u2018re more closely allied with the photographic operators than the hunters. They are finishing off the wildlife before we\u2018ve had a chance to realize a profit from it. Hunters don\u2018t recognize us; they only recognize the government ...25 percent of hunting fees goes into the \u2018hole\u2019 at the district. We\u2018re supposed to get 5 percent: we don\u2018t even see that.' (Sachedina 2008, p152) \\n It's also important to examine where this $200 million figure actually comes from. $100m of this estimate is based on an unpublished study by the Professional Hunters Association of South Africa. \\n Combine all this with the fact that lions are an internationally recognised vulnerable species, and that their numbers have dwindled by around 30% in the last 20 years, it's fairly easy to see that saying conservation relies upon the hunting industry is entirely spurious. Other forms of safari generate significantly more than this niche form of tourism without causing anywhere near as much damage to the local wildlife.\", \"I tell myself I chose to be single but in a moment of drunken sincerity here is the real reason. \\n The girl I am absolutely besotted with I broke up with a year ago for some unknown reason. I think I was just complacent and we were both going through some stuff that I thought it would be better if we just sorted out on our own. Additionally we were moving away from each other and I was getting really wound up the more I discovered about her promiscuous past (which is completely ridiculous, it's the past for a reason) but I'd be on a night out or something then someone I know would turn out to have had a threesome with her with someone else etc. I know I shouldn't be annoyed, but it does hurt when you have that mental image thrust upon you about the person you love. \\n Anyway, present day and we have been broken up for a year when all of a sudden I get a text from her saying she still thinks about me and would love to just meet up again. Just to sort of renegotiate friendship I think. So she comes to visit and as soon as I see her I suddenly realised exactly why I'd spent all year pining over this girl. It all came flooding back. The best part is it turns out she felt exactly the same way! I was/am completely willing to apply for jobs and move to where she wants to be etc. I just have a complete epiphany that this is the person I want to end up with. \\n Sounds great thus far... until she gets a phone call telling her that she has been offered a job in NYC and is going to take it. (I'm from the UK). The thing is I'd even be willing to take a job in NYC myself but she is only there for 1 year so it isn't worth it. \\n So essentially I spend all last year single because every time I got close to anyone else I just couldn't bring myself to get into a relationship with them. Just as I start to move on I see her again and am now destined for another year of pining over the one that got away. We aren't in a relationship whilst she's away too, so I am constantly wondering if she is just going to find someone else too. She pretty much told me she intends to sleep around so that would kinda suck too.\", \"I really didn't know that 'snuff' was a real thing tbh.

What policies need to help out New York City would also need to be beneficial to backwater Louisiana.

Looking at it from many angles is a good idea.  Certainly parents should be more involved.  But, the difficult thing with that is that no parent wants to believe their child is a bully.  Along with many parents who really don't give a shit, or are absent.  So the school does need to be involved.  I mean if I ran an ice cream shop and saw a kid bullying another kid in my shop, I would put a stop to it.  School should be doing the same thing. \\n Parents should be doing more, I do believe this.  But there is only so much they can do.  A lot of bullying, if played out by adults, would be classified as (sometimes sexual) harassment and/or assault.  I would say the school is responsible for policing activities that occur on their property. \\n So the responsibility lies with both parents and schools, but schools are functioned by the government where they can actually have a say in what happens.  The government can't force parents to punish their children at home, but they can punish them in the schools. \\n What we should be doing is creating an environment were bullying is unacceptable, as viewed by other students.  That is, if one student is bullying another, the rest of the students will stop it from happening.

I do think the current anti-bullying media coverage is helping with this. \\n As for the parents of bullied kids, they usually are doing just about everything imaginable to help their child, and do not deserve any blame for what happens to them while at school.  Most parents whose children are bullied confront both the school and the bully's parents, usually without much success unless the school cooperates. \\n And what about kids who are bullied who have absent parents?

Sorry about the following. \\n Sure, it would be disappointing to have trained so hard to see such meager results, but, and this is something Dragonshy did as well, my problem with Fluttershy when she has her own episodes is this: \\n In other episodes, Fluttershy works great as a background character. Her little gags and tiny jokes work crazy well when the focus isn\\'t on her, IMO. But when she\\'s the main character, there\\'s only so many ways the plot can go. She can either stop being a pushover for laughs (Best Night Ever, Putting Your Hoof Down), or her excessive phobia of some single thing can be the problem she has to get over dramatically at the very end of the episode (Dragonshy, Hurricane Fluttershy). \\n When it\\'s the former, Fluttershy\\'s great in this role. But when it\\'s the latter, I just can\\'t stand it. Whenever she has to toughen up to overcome one thing, due to plot restrictions, she HAS to do it at the end. This means the thing she has to get over can\\'t be a tiny problem, like a puddle of water or a particularly frighteningly-shaped bush. It has to be some huge, fuck-all, end-of-world problem. In Dragonshy, it\\'s a tremendous dragon whose smoke will cover the sun, and in Hurricane Fluttershy it\\'s the looming threat of Cloudsdale running out of water, which will lead to no water for any of Equestria\\'s shitload of plants. \\n All of that\\'s fine, in theory. But my problem with it is that when this happens, it means that Fluttershy being scared of a problem she can quickly and painlessly solve could easily fuck up  the whole world.  When Dash has her breakdown in Sonic Rainboom, it\\'s not threatening to consume all of Equestria. When Rarity acts like a bitch in Sisterhooves Social, it\\'s not about to kill every plant in the land, etc. \\n She knows damn well she can talk to every animal, and that she\\'s had no problems with Spike, meaning he\\'s just another animal to communicate with. I can understand the fear of a huge dragon when  the sun isn\\'t about to be blocked out for a thousand years.  She knows damn well that the eponymous storm that they must create in Hurricane Fluttershy isn\\'t a competition, it\\'s a group effort to keep  every single plant in Equestria  from dying. \\n And that\\'s basically why Dragonshy and Hurricane Fluttershy are two of my absolute least favorite episodes, right above Feeling Pinkie Keen.', 'Why does everyone keep forgetting C?!  Allow me to attempt to explain this as calmly as possible, because the fact that people ignore the third scenario so often pisses me off so much I start seeing red. This might be a rant, and it will probably be angry. \\n Right now, I\\'m sitting in front of my TV, playing the Last of Us. The Internet has been down for a week. Impossible, right? No. I live in Mobile, AL, where the  only  choice for broadband Internet for  fucking years  was AT&T. \\n This is a shitty situation. Sometimes for months at a time, the Internet goes out inexplicably, and since they\\'ve got a monopoly in the area, AT&T doesn\\'t give a shit. They\\'ll send out a technician  \"whoever.\"  \"whenever.\" As a point of reference, my  fastest  Internet speed during this time (meaning more often than not, it was much slower than this) was 750. Kb. KILO-FUCKING-BITS. \\n Then, just a few years ago, we got a second option! Amazing, right? A few years before the second option showed up, AT&T announced that they\\'d be expanding their Broadband service in our area to a blistering 8 Mb/s. So obviously, we got that, because it was our only choice and satellite internet, while technically a choice, was about as stable and cheap as a long term relationship with an itchy prostitute. \\n But the second option!, you cry. What about the second choice! Surely they could provide a better alternative! \\n The second option was Comcast. \\n Now, maybe you live in an area where this isn\\'t the case, but I can fucking assure you that Comcast is not a generally pleasant company to get services from. They were able to get our speed to a relatively non-second-world-country-level 25-ish Mb/s. So the story ends there, right? Of course it fucking doesn\\'t. The modem they sent out is constantly on the fritz. The lights all work, but it gives no signal. The lights don\\'t come on at all. The Internet stutters and starts every few minutes. The signal goes out entirely every night at 10 PM, you fucking name it. So a stable Internet connection from Comcast isn\\'t in the cards right now either. \\n Check in with a mobile phone!, I hear you shout, as your trump card to defeat all opposition. I get a bar. A single bar of the \"O\" Verizon network, if I crouch into a corner of my room. I need to drive a few minutes into the city to get a stable signal. \\n What about other services?, you insist. The only other options around here are AT&T (we are not giving those motherfuckers any more of our money after the shit they pulled with our Internet service, and they have shit cellular service in most of the South anyway), Sprint (which has more of a reception in the outer city than in the place where we live somehow), or T-Mobile, whose customer service has been the subject of horror stories in our area. \\n So there\\'s all those options out. \\n Okay, so your options are moot, I hear you agree. But honestly, what kind of city do you live in that has such terrible reception of all kinds? Surely it must be fifteen minutes from Buttfuck, Louisiana and Cousinmolest, Florida. \\n [Mobile, Alabama is only a few thousand shy of Pensacola, and is a movie length away from New Orleans.]( \\n So there\\'s option fucking C. I\\'m sorry this comment comes off as pissed, but that\\'s because  it fucking is.  Any console that requires even a once-daily semi-stable Internet connection to play a game I fucking paid for is only going to come in this house strapped to the guy that designed it, handcuffed to a fucking chair, with a nail-studded baseball bat in a fucking red bow.

It also works the other way, however: private schools can teach whatever they want, and if they appeal to a certain market (crazy fundamentalists who don't want their kids learning the devil's science), then their profit is pretty much guaranteed. \\n Would you prefer regulations that favored one meat company while not allowing rat shit in your food, or would you prefer a fair free market that has no laws or restrictions against rat shit?\", 'Because that post isn\\'t bashing CoD. That post is bashing people who call others out for doing the same shit they\\'re doing. \"Hardcore\" gaming doesn\\'t just mean World of Warcraft. It means you devote your life to a game, of any kind, be it Angry Birds or Diablo 2. If someone spent every waking hour of their day gathering all the stars and killing all the pigs, working towards 100% completion, and speedrunning the entire game once finished, I\\'d hardly think it\\'d be fair to call what they do \"casual.\" As such, someone who plays CoD 24/7 is a hardcore gamer, whether you like the game they play or not. \\n The people in that comic, however, are clearly casual, if a  bit  more into their game than most Angry Birds fans. A \"hardcore\" Call of Duty player would have had that game ordered months before its release, as well as all relevant accessories and the Premium service, and would possibly even be playing a leaked copy of the new version in anticipation of their copy arriving in Day-of-Release shipping from Amazon or the like.', 'The only reason the show changed its focus from little-girl-centric \\n There\\'s your problem right there. The focus isn\\'t on little girls. It\\'s on families. The show is designed so families can watch it all together, and each family member get something out of it. Hence Benny Hill references, an entire scene plucked straight out of Star Wars, an infidelity joke at a character\\'s expense, and so on. \\n >The show\\'s creators saw dollar signs \\n What the show\\'s creators (including Lauren Faust, in case you didn\\'t already know, of Powerpuff Girls and Foster\\'s Home fame)  saw  was a large group of unexpected fans who liked the show for what it could be. They then worked to make the show into that vision. I understand Hasbro doesn\\'t have the best rap, but they\\'ve allowed all of the episodes to be put up on YouTube in 1080p for free. They allow fans to sell each other content based around the show without giving Hasbro even the smallest cut. They put a fan-made character into the show, even the thought the character was literally born out of an animation error. \\n >\"bronies\" have their own sites. Their own conventions. Their own channel. Their own game mods. Their own LANGUAGE. \\n First of all, no. Trying to group all bronies under any label is fruitless and stupid, much like grouping all atheists together under anything besides the one basic thing they  have  to have in common. Secondly, even if that was true, so? There are dozens of conventions every year, about equally trivial subjects. What about video gamers? We buy merchandise for video games we like and wear them or use them because we enjoy the game (or because we\\'re making an ironic statement, but fuck those people no matter what the shirt or mouse or whatever says). \\n >The fanbase has developed an obsessive  cult  around the show, [...] If anyone says they don\\'t like the show or the culture, they\\'re simply a \"neighsayer.\" \\n First off, I\\'ve never heard anyone say that. Not that they don\\'t, I\\'m sure someone\\'s used that term before, just that I, as a brony, who frequents Equestria Daily and hangs out with bronies IRL, have never heard or used that phrase. Secondly, again, so? This \"cult\" as you describe it also describes a typical reddit circlejerk, of which there are thousands, and practically any TV show that reddit likes gets this treatment. \\n >A socially-inept loser is not someone who sits down to watch Spongebob with their toddler and actually enjoys the show. [...] The type of man who is so obsessed with someone else\\'s creation that they create rule 34 fanfic starring cartoon ponies that were originally created for the education and enjoyment of little girls, specifically, and then has to share them with everyone. \\n Not much to argue with here, except, again, that it  wasn\\'t created specifically for little girls.  I\\'ve already mentioned it was created by Lauren Faust, but I\\'ll say right now, that if you think Powerpuff Girls of Foster\\'s Home had absolutely no intention of creating a show that all ages could enjoy, we will get nowhere discussing this. Walt Disney said it best, and I\\'m paraphrasing here: \"If you aim only for kids, you\\'re dead. Adults are just children grown up anyways.\" I think he went on to talk about how Jews are the cesspool of humanity or something, but the point stands. Disney\\'s films, and the good Dreamworks films, prove that there\\'s a difference between \"family-friendly\" and \"kid-friendly.\"', 'The OP is [here]( This will likely be a lot longer than the original, but I feel like I need to say a lot about this game. This is going to just be a straight-up review, rather than whatever the fuck my last post was. It\\'ll be very, very, very long, but like last time, I feel like I need to get this stuff off my chest. I\\'ll try and make it entertaining. Results not guaranteed. \\n Almost a year ago (jesus christ) I posted to /r/Vita warning people from buying Persona 4 Golden just because a lot of people kept recommending it. There was a lot of interesting discussion, and several people said they hoped I would finish it to see how my opinion evolved. Since then, it finally got its hooks into me and I finished it. I don\\'t sit here humbled, as I still have several problems with it and didn\\'t play it at all as it\\'s meant to be played, but I can now give a complete opinion based on a full play through of the game. I\\'ll use the same categories as last time around. \\n Characters, i.e. Story/Plot/Dialogue/Narrative: \\n A lot of people on the OP, as well as IRL fans of Persona 4, told me my hatred of Yosuke was unjust. As I continued playing, I found more and more reasons that those people are wrong. As more members joined my party, the more I began to loathe the old ones. By the time Naoto joined my party (<3, for reals), I had a deep and burning passionate hatred for Yosuke. Maybe it\\'s because I knew a lot of people like him in high school, and maybe that\\'s the point, but almost everything he says - while well-emoted considering Yuri Lowenthal donates his voice - is either homophobic, misogynist, or something that belongs in middle school, and if there were any characters in this game who weren\\'t white as the driven snow, I\\'m sure he\\'d be a racist as well. And what pissed me off even more is that every stupid fucking thing Yosuke comes up with, you just have to go along with. No matter what dialogue choice you pick, you\\'ve got to get the stupid scooter, and you\\'ve got to break into the girls\\' hotel room, and you\\'ve got to do this and that. It\\'s one of my issues with a lot of Japanese games, where the player gets the illusion of choice, but the protagonist actually has very little. Turns it from a JRPG into more of a JG. \\n Luckily, the other characters fared much, much better. I didn\\'t put enough thought into Yukiko or Chie to hate either of them, since their social links are so boring compared to everyone else\\'s apocalyptic tragedy striking left and right. Kanji was more interesting, but it got old how everyone else talked shit about him all the time, especially considering that he appears to be three fucking feet taller than all of them in the actual anime cutscenes. Rise is too slutty of a fifteen/sixteen year old girl for me to be comfortable with, which comes off as a little bit too Japanese as well, if you get my meaning. It might be legal there, but from what I played of this game, none of these characters, adults included, are in the right frame of mind to be having sex with anyone. Maybe a therapist if that\\'s the only way they could pay. Once Teddie joins your party, he\\'s probably my second favorite, but he keeps making those purposefully unfunny bear puns that just get stale really fast for me. Naoto is my absolute favorite character in a game I\\'ve played this year so far, but even she\\'s got the issue where she joins your party at about the 7/10ths point and gets 90% of the lines from then on out. Mind you, the more she talks, the less Yosuke has to open his stupid fucking mouth, so there\\'s that. Way to go, Naoto. <3 \\n Actually, mentioning Naoto brings up a good problem I have with this game, in that it seems to think it\\'s a lot more clever than it actually is. When Naoto first appears on the scene, you\\'re clearly supposed to believe she\\'s a guy, because... I\\'m not really sure, actually. All the other characters keep saying \"he\" to the point where it becomes suspicious, and this is an anime, after all, where genders are neutral until proven otherwise. But if you\\'ve ever consumed any form of media ever, you know just by the voice acting cues and body language that Naoto is a girl pretending to be a guy within minutes of talking to her. The party all seems to truly believe that  Whodunit spoiler  was responsible for the murders, and then they\\'re all so  certain  that  whodunit spoiler number 2  was responsible, but if you\\'ve been paying attention at all, you not only know that neither of them are responsible (especially considering that if you\\'ve checked the calendar, you know there are months and months and months left in the game at that point), but you probably also know who did it. Hell, I knew who did it in the first few weeks.  whodunit spoiler 3  What\\'s that? There\\'s more to this murder case than meets the eye?  whodunit spoiler 4  All of these seem like they\\'re supposed to be some big reveal, but they never were. And of course, once you find out who the not-final bad person is, they drop their previous personality and start acting like a card-carrying villain for real, with evil laughter and \"this world is bullshit\" to boot. \\n All that said, I really enjoyed the writing that didn\\'t have Yosuke in it. I found myself laughing my ass off more than a few times, although a lot of it came when an anime cutscene started and everyone was talking to Fuck Me! Fuck Me! and he had nothing to say but grunting noises. The characters are all very well realized, even if I grew to hate more than a few of them, and only come more into focus through the Social Links mechanic, which works very well, even if it\\'s a bit unrealistic that every single person in Inaba has some horrible backstory of their parents raping and killing each other before drunk driving into an orphanage where a flock of baby rabbits came out and exploded into clouds of blood mist. The characters that I didn\\'t hate, more often than not I loved. I was surprised that  plot twisty spoiler  as that would have been a really good motivator for the characters, and the outcome felt really cheap to me, as if they\\'d pulled a Dark Knight Rises or a Star Trek: Into Darkness, where they get to have the dramatic sacrifice/death, but also get to keep the character around, which cheapens the whole part about them dying. \\n Gameplay, i.e. Dungeon-sprinting, Friend-making, Ass-kicking: \\n At the recommendation of some people, I played through this game on Very Easy mode, where every fight can be retried indefinitely and immediately with fully restored HP and SP for you but not the enemy. Therefore, my opinion on the gameplay probably doesn\\'t hold much more water than a pair of cupped hands in the shower. I skipped most of the combat and breezed through the actual fighting gameplay. This was a choice I made due to the fact that I\\'ve never even been able to get past the first town in Pokemon out of boredom with turn-based combat. Now that I know just how easy Very Easy mode is, I\\'m likely to restart the game on VE mode again and just rush through every battle. \\n Anyway, since I felt no threat from the TV world, I was free to do as little of possible of it. I spent almost no time in the TV world when I wasn\\'t fighting a boss fight. And the gameplay on the non-TV side of the game is... Well, it\\'s really sparse, but I still got a great deal of enjoyment out of it. It consists almost entirely of dialogue choices and social links, this game\\'s version of hanging out with Roman, your cousin. Only in this game, every time Roman asks you to do something with him, it\\'s different while still following an overarching theme that varies from person to person. Rise has anxieties about leaving her career as an idol (one more aspect of Japanese culture that weirds me the fuck out, especially considering they\\'re literally called \" idol \" at fifteen years old), Naoto is realizing that she\\'s not as mature as she likes to act, Yosuke is a flaming douchebag, etc. The main reason for doing these links is to enable you to kick more ass in the TV world, but since I felt no threat from the TV world, I really just did them because I liked the characters so much. I even finished Yosuke, but that was because I heard at the end you got to beat the shit out of him. \\n All that said, I enjoyed the time I\\'ve spent with Persona 4 Golden. I\\'ll probably go for the platinum now. If I had to give it a score, I\\'d give it a solid 7 out of 10. One of those points is because I find turn-based combat monotonous as fuck, and the other two are for the narrative issues I mention above.']": "Based on the example postings, the user is interested in:\n1.

First round of bills comes in, he refuses to pay his half of the cable/internet (even though it was agreed before he moved in) so I changed the wifi password.  (you don\\'t pay you don\\'t use... fair in my opinion.)  He responded by keying up my leather furniture,  taking the magnadoodle we had on the wall for notes and \"running it over with his car over and OVER AND OVER and it felt GRREEEAAAATTTT!!!\", and a few other crazy things.  When I tried to talk to him about how unnecessary all of this was, he could simply pay his half of the bill and I would gladly set the wifi back to public, he THREATENED TO KILL MY COCKER SPANIEL, stating that the only reason I had a dog was so I had something to control.

He started screaming about how I was a communist and a controlling psycho and slammed his door repeatedly like Molly Shannon in \"Superstar.\"    Needless to say I moved out as fast as possible.

I have two options: \\n 1) Sell my current car, which is paid off (I can get a bit over $20k for it), buy a 'new' 1-2 year old car at a good price, pocket the ~$6k difference. \\n Net return: $0.  $6k improvement in cash position (more assets to invest) \\n 2) Sell my current car, buy a 'new' 1-2 year old car at a good price with a loan at 0.89% over 5 years.  With a 20% down payment, this comes out to $200/month payment.  With the remaining money, buy an investment property with a net cashflow of $350/month.  Should be able to pay the car loan and net ~$150/month, as well as capture at least $15k of equity, net of all costs.  Should still have $6k left over after that, which is a good chunk of the way towards a second property. \\n Net return: $1800/year net cashflow, $9k PROFIT ($15,000 equity capture offsets $12k loan, with $6k left over).\", \"Depends on your cashflow situation. All my properties cashflow at least $200/month after all expenses. If the values all went to 0 cashflow would roughly double due to reduced taxes.  Buy and hold investing has an indefinite holding period, so market conditions aren't hugely relevant. The only real risk would be if the market tanked between purchase of a distressed property and backend refi. If you know what you're doing it should take less than 30 days to rehab, refi and rent though, so risk is not very pronounced. \\n OTOH if you are flipping, or buying based on speculated appreciation, you can get annihilated in a market downturn. The vast majority of investors hurt by the crash were either doing that, or buying things without adequate margin of safety. \\n Multifamily valuation is entirely based on cashflow/cap rate, so is only minimally affected by the RE market.\", 'With that said, there a lot of really huge folks in /r/weightroom and /r/advancedfitness, because people who are really good at things like being around other people who are really good at things. \\n It\\'s even more important in financial matters, given how sensitive most people are regarding money.

If you\\'re going to be taken seriously by scientists, you need to explain how you think it works. You know, provide some explanatory content, some meat other scientists can chew on, something scientists can  criticize . \\n And as it so happens, most traditionally supernatural claims offer no explanatory content. Some supernatural claims  do  have a great deal of explanatory content, but they haven\\'t survived any sort of rigorous examination. However, these non-answer traditionally supernatural claims are just  a small subset  of all the non-answers available.

Something like [this]( \\n We have a search space (the graph), we can apply a fitness function (empirical adequacy, or something like that), the nodes on the graph in the search space are our scientific theories, the edges of a node correspond to possible changes in our theories. Whatever edge produces the best result of the fitness function is selected. And so on. \\n We want to reach the global maximum, to optimize our theories, but we can only move further away from the global and local minima. Sounds a lot like evolution, no?

If the theory correctly predicts events only within a limited area, and assume that this limited area is either as large or larger than our available knowledge (imagine that it\\'s the part of the graph we can see, the rest of it obscured by an infinitely large piece of white paper), then any change to the theory in light of our available knowledge would make it slide down the slope towards a local minima, now incorrectly predicting events. In brief, there\\'s no way of knowing that the theory is true or false with our available knowledge. \\n Only a new theory, one that \\'scraps the whole project\\', by explaining how a previous test was mistaken, or an auxiliary hypothesis was in error, or that the old theory was a limiting case of the new theory, can expand our available knowledge. It will open up a new plateau (critical experiment) that the two theories can then be compared on: if the old theory survives, then when we\\'ve cut a bit out of the paper, we see that the local maximum was in fact larger than we anticipated; if the new theory triumphs, we\\'ve started to crawl up a new crest towards another local maximum. We can look across a new vista and start again. \\n Of course, one problem is that no matter how imaginative we are, we are constrained by the state of our current technology.

I\\'m attempting to apply these principles to predicting kicker value. Kicker opportunity/usage are represented by:\\nField goal attempts per game Team FGA\\nExtra point attempts per game Team XPA\\nboth of which reflect the ability of a kicker\\'s offense to move the ball down field, their ability to score touchdowns, & their reliance upon the kicking game (e.g. long field goal attempts vs going for it on 4th & short, two point conversions vs extra points, etc...). However, the kicker\\'s offense is only half the story & the opposing defense plays an equally important role, represented by:\\nOpponent field goal attempts per game Opponent FGA\\nOpponent extra point attempts per game Opponent XPA\\nMethod:\\nScoring (for calculation of fantasy points; my league\\'s settings):\\nXP = 1 pt\\nFG 0-39 = 3 pts\\nFG 40-49 = 4 pts\\nFG 50+ = 5 pts\\nFG Missed 0-39 = -2 pts\\nFG Missed 40-49 = -1 pts\\nFG Missed 50+ = 0 pts\\nXP Missed = -1\\nUsing individual kicker data from 2012, 2013, & the first 7 weeks of 2014, I calculated what each FGA was worth in fantasy points for each kicker in 2012, 2013, & through the first 7 weeks of 2014. I then combined the data, weighting 2013 twice as much as 2012, & weighting 2014 twice as much as 2013:\\n2014: 6.25% per game (total contribution: 43.75%)\\n2013: 3.125% per game (total contribution: 37.50%)\\n2012: 1.5625% per game (total contribution: 18.75%)\\nI averaged Team FGA with Opponent FGA (weighting 2013 data at 56.25% & 2014 data at 43.75%) to predict FGA for each week 8 match-up. I applied each kicker\\'s \"efficiency\" (the conversion factor from FGA to fantasy points calculated above) to predict the number of points likely to be generated from FGA. Similarly, I averaged Team XPA with Opponent XPA (again weighting 2013 data at 56.25% & 2014 data at 43.75%) to predict XPA for each week 8 match-up. I assumed 100% conversion rate for XPA to simplify calculations in predicting the number of points likely to be generated from XPA.

However, there are some other factors to consider:\\nYou didn\\'t spend your 11th round pick drafting Gostkowski\\nYou have the flexibility of being able to drop your kicker every week for 4-5 days of an extra bench spot\\nYou aren\\'t holding two kickers through Gostkowski\\'s bye week or replacing him ROS with the best available kicker at that point in the season\\nI believe that these extra factors are worth small point differential between Gostkowski and streaming kickers. Do these factors translate to additional wins? If you drafted Martellus Bennett or Ahmad Bradshaw in the 11th instead of Gostkowski, then almost certainly.\\nThere are some inherent limitations to this model:\\nThese rankings rely heavily on historical data, particularly during the early weeks.\\nThese rankings do NOT account for home/away, weather/dome, or injury/personnel changes.\\nThese rankings do NOT account for bye weeks, so each 2014 game for a player who has already had his bye week will have slightly more impact upon these rankings than 2014 games for players who have not already had their bye weeks.\\nRookie kickers have been assigned the NFL average \\'fantasy points per FGA\\' for periods during which no historical data is available. If part of a rookie kicker\\'s allure is his accuracy/range (e.g. Cody Parkey), then these rankings may undervalue him; conversely, if a rookie kicker has questionable accuracy/range (e.g. Cairo Santos), then these rankings may overvalue him.\\nThe projected points are less important than the rank order & the true value of these projections lies in identifying kickers/match-ups with multiple factors predicting high (or low) fantasy-scoring conditions, which are represented by the extremes. My advice is to use the following in order to select a starting kicker:\\nThis (a data-driven model heavily reliant upon team match-ups & historical data)\\nFantasyPros ECR (an expert opinion-driven model best presented this way by /u/prayes)\\nVegas line & ELO ratings (favor kickers on higher scoring teams and teams predicted to win)\\nStadium & weather conditions (favor home, dome, & good weather)\\nFantasy strength of schedule (best presented this way by /u/stmack)\\nOne final consideration when dealing with frequently streamed positions (K, D/ST, & sometimes TE) is bye week congestion: if a significant number of other teams share a bye week with your streamed player, you\\'ll potentially be competing with other owners picking up bye week fill-ins, in addition to the fact that you\\'ll also be more likely to have other roster needs to address with your waiver priority during congested bye weeks.

I hate that phrase too. \\n The ECU reads all of the sensors so many times a second.  Usually this number is pretty high.  I can\\'t remember at the moment.  The sensors take readings which are based on voltage resistance.  There are sensors that read intake air temp and flow, throttle position, exhaust temp and composition, timing, fuel flow rate, and so on and so on.  There is a butt load of sensors located in and around your engine monitoring a large number of variables. \\n There is an optimum range for all of these readings.  The raw data  just shows voltage readings.  What a Scan Gauge will do is take all of those readings and use some fancy math to convert them for you so it\\'s easy to read.  Stock mileage calculators don\\'t get as deep as to display something such as your timing but they use this data none-the-less. \\n Now, to calculate that data and give you a mileage calculation they likely use some logarithmic formula created for that engine size and type along with the transmission.  This calculation has to be recalculated probably hundreds of times a second with new variables. \\n With all of these calculations there is bound to be wiggle room somewhere.  Luckily there is an easy way to figure out just how \"off\" the computer is.  Take the average mileage that you obtained during a tank of gas.  Many vehicles and aftermarket computers can keep track of this.  Now fill up your vehicle and divide the amount you used to fill it by how many miles you\\'ve driven.', \"Update 2:  Mini is going for service on Tuesday at 8AM!

Fundamentals have been strong - corporate earnings have been fine, cash is still quite historically cheap (as is debt) and although valuations are up and it's becoming harder to find deals, there are plenty of great operating businesses at a not-too-awful premium, even after a 30%+ run last year.  Cyclical business have been enjoying nice, but not 'top of cycle' gains, job growth has been solid, and housing has been okay.  The only thing to 'spook' the average investor has been interest rates, and although they'll eventually start to move up, it's more of a bull case at this point because the Federal Reserve is signaling belief in the strength of the economy. \\n Q1 scared a lot of folks, and it got kind of annoying how often companies blamed the weather (especially through Q2), but the general consensus, reflected in the market, was that the weather  did  contribute to a lousy Q1, and we saw somewhat of a 'bounce' in Q2.  Moreover, there's still some nice excess capacity in the economy and nothing looks terribly inflationary about growth right now.\", \"From reading your comments in the rest of this thread, I think you're just trying to find angles to play in a NATO/Ukraine/Russia conflict - BUT your question was about WWI and WWII, so it's worth digging into what can and can't be learned from those conflicts. \\n First, although World War II (which is a nearer comparison in that a modern, market economy existed) was REALLY good for the US in a macro-sense, it wasn't particularly good for businessmen or individuals.  Particularly, [you should know that Harry S Truman first gained national attention because he was running the 'Truman Commission']( which was effectively a Congressional oversight committee with broad authority to correct war profiteering.  There were also [a glut of federal organizations]( designed to 'steer' the economy into the right directions for victory.  As you probably are also aware, there was a great deal of rationing as well - again, [the war effort was a centrally controlled one]( with most of the elements of the free market stripped away.  It's not an exaggeration to say that the US economy in World War II probably looked more like China's did ten years ago than our economy now - central planning with some elements of free market rewards for individuals. \\n It also goes without saying that all allied government issued a great deal of debt - US 'war bonds' totaled about $185 billion, or about $2.5 trillion adjusted for inflation.  They were zero-coupons, typically sold at a 75% discount, maturing at face value. That works out to about 2.5% compounded (they were ten year duration). \\n I'd never really paid attention to the economic impact of a world at war before, but [this article]( from WealthManagement.com points to the fact that equity markets in the major combatant nations pretty much identified each nations 'turning point' i.e. US markets were down after Pearl Harbor, and stayed down significantly until around Midway.  German markets were up as they Blitzkrieg-ed through Europe, but started drawing back with the invasion of Russia and never really stopped.  This held even when news media was nationalized - the wisdom of crowds, I suppose. \\n SO...rule #1 of investing in a war would clearly be to pick the right side.  Most of the reason that the US emerged in such great shape after World War II had to do with the fact that no American industry had been destroyed - in fact, the wartime expansion (and worldwide needs after 5-10 years of warfare) couldn't have been engineered any better to set the US up for success.  However, in Germany, Japan, and even in places like France and the Netherlands, significant economic capacity was destroyed, and it took decades for it to eventually return.  Well, at least, that's how it seems...specific numbers have eluded me, but most countries physically involved in the war zone suffered pretty catastrophic economic damage 1938-1945, but saw strong, consistent single digit growth 1945-1970.  Unfortunately, especially in 38-45, folks were far more focused on bombs and battleships than on GDP, especially as things were in flux quite a bit (one big bombing raid could wipe out a whole city worth of economic resources, as it were). \\n As the Wealth Management article points out - in a 'losing' side, pretty much the only thing that retained value were precious commodities - silver and gold and the like, in physical form, but even then, war has a bad habit of breaking down property rights.  So perhaps we should say physically held commodities NOT located in the conflict zone are the best investment when the world catches fire.  Assuming, of course, you survive at all. \\n On the winning side, it seems like most portions of the economy actually bloomed together - luxury items like cars and radios didn't sell well during the war, but those factories were converted over to build airplanes and military transmitters, and consumer goods were the same way - either vital to the war effort (why spam is so popular in Hawaii to this day) or turned to war purposes (razors to bullets, as it were).  There's been a lot written about World War II, at least from the Japanese side, being a pretty straight conflict over resources, with the Japanese needing oil to expand their economy and the U.S. embargo leading almost directly to Pearl Harbor.  So if I were looking to be a war profiteer, that's probably what I'd focus on - commodities like iron, copper, aluminum, uranium, crude oil, and maybe some natural gas as well.  Slightly less likely to be nationalized than an arms dealer, potentially in a lucrative position with increased demand in a conflict, and also well positioned when the conflict ended.  But since that's a pretty risk strategy, I'd also be looking for diversified equity holdings - assuming I thought my country was going to win - with a collection of well run businesses so they could adapt to changing times.  Or, you know, how I invest when there's not a war on. \\n I think it's also interesting that investing in a country in a full-out war is really all about the macro - if your country wins, you can do okay, but if your country loses, you will be lucky to have  most  of the buying power you had before the conflict.  So maybe those 2.5% war bonds aren't such a bad idea after all.\", 'It\\'s shockingly hard to find any advice on /r/personalfinance about any professional wealth manager besides, \"You could do it for much cheaper at Vanguard.\"  So you should know that going in.  The circlejerk is quite loud and powerful.  Not even incorrect, always, just loud and powerful. \\n Your advisor sold you the whole life policy because it, \"Grows cash value without market participation!\"  If it\\'s Northwestern Mutual, they quoted that, \"On average, our whole life policies for the past 100 years have grown at 7%.\"  Insurance is, generally, a terrible investment, except as a wealth transfer tool.  If you\\'re not planning your estate with this policy, you would be  much  better served with a term policy.  If it\\'s meant as a wealth transfer tool - i.e. you\\'re concerned about running up against the $5 mil or so estate tax limit - then why aren\\'t you using a Variable policy to get  real  7% growth? \\n Oppenheimer isn\\'t the worst fund company out there, but the funds you were sold are all A-shares, and your advisor should have gone through the costs associated with them.  I personally am not crazy about Oppenheimer because their bond funds aren\\'t that great - why use a company with only half a portfolio?  And their fees tend to be fairly high for mediocre performance.  Did your advisor discuss with you why he felt Oppenheimer was the right fit?  Chances are that he or she doesn\\'t know how to sell anything else. \\n Their equity income fund is actually quite good - but I like their \\'Main Street\\' fund better than their \\'Discovery Fund.\\'  Again, I don\\'t actually know that much about them, but Main Street is one of their flag ships. \\n The two things I hate most in your portfolio (besides the whole life insurance and lack of discussion of fees) is the real estate fund and the floating rate loan fund.  The real estate fund is a niche investment, with typically lower returns - it\\'s supposed to be uncorrelated with the rest of your portfolio, but real estate is basically as cyclical as stocks with less actual growth.  You\\'d be better off with a good bond fund...which, of course, Oppenheimer doesn\\'t really have.  Most advisors that use Oppenheimer use their real estate fund as an \\'income producing vehicle\\' in the place of a good bond fund (supposedly their real estate fund is quite good, too, but I\\'ve never looked at it seriously because niche investment). \\n Your advisor put you in floating rate loans as a hedge against rising interest rates, but that\\'s fucking stupid.  Floating rate loans are  really  low quality debt, which means that sure, you\\'ll get a higher return when interest rates rise, but because the issuers are typically not in good financial shape to begin with (think about mortgages - who are the type of people that go for variable rate mortgages instead of fixed?  Right, those that can\\'t qualify for a good fixed rate), when the next recession hits, those issuers of \\'Senior Floating Rate\\' debt will be  significantly  more likely to default.  Moreover, when you  need  bonds in your portfolio, to appreciate in value and provide consistent income during a market downturn, this particular investment will perform  even worse  than stocks.  But they\\'re an easy sell (rising interest rates!) and when your portfolio goes to shit during the next downturn, they\\'re easy to explain away (everything is down!). \\n Let that whole life policy lapse - sure, there\\'s no cash value there, but who cares, there won\\'t be in a couple of years, either, and you\\'d literally be better throwing the difference into a money market fund at .01% than paying more for coverage you can get with term.  Of the $4k lump sum that you used to get started, how much is cash value right now? \\n As for your advisor - well, there\\'s no real point in firing him now, since he\\'s already made his month and gotten the sales charges out of you.  If he isn\\'t using good tools to help you build a financial plan, though, I\\'d look at moving the account - and I sure as Hell wouldn\\'t bring him any more money.', 'This is a subtly profound question - and current mids are far too involved in graduation/summer training to answer.  Shame, too - I know they would have some really great responses. \\n So two ways to think about - the first is that all the trite, jingoistic patriotic bullshit is absolutely  not , if you believe in it.  What\\'s interesting is that you can go to USNA to \"serve your nation\" and not have the first fucking clue about what it means.  USNA will teach you.  It\\'s not about dying for a cause - it\\'s about living for one, and it\\'s much, much harder. \\n The other thing is that the bond that you\\'ll have with the men and women you serve with....it\\'s hard to put into words.  At my job, I occasionally run into other grads - and the camaraderie, even though we otherwise don\\'t know each other from the man in the moon, is really incredible.  The best way to put it is that it\\'s the largest fraternity in the world - except our brotherhood (and sisterhood) is forged in plebe summer, through service to our nation across the seven seas and around the globe.  It\\'s remarkable, and humbling, and moving, all at the same time.  Because that guy or girl - they get you in a way that almost no one on Earth, including your closest lovers and confidantes, ever will.  They understand IHTFP, and chow calls, and chopping, the days, and Plebe Chemistry and Wires and Sparks and parades and football games and march ons and all the other things, awesome and awful, that for four years define almost every ounce of who you are. \\n I never served in combat...but I get the impression that it\\'s a similar idea.  No one that wasn\\'t \\'there\\' will ever understand.  And so - true story - it becomes a shorthand thing.  When you meet another Academy guy (or girl), you understand that you share a bond on a very fundamental level, and in this world, that means a lot.  You will trust others, and have them trust you, solely on the principle that they\\'re an Academy grad, so you know what they\\'re made of. \\n You will never be normal again.  That place, Mother B, will change you.  Mostly for the better, sometimes for the worse.  And you\\'ll learn what service means - the first email you get from your class president, saying that you\\'ve lost a classmate, you\\'ll shrug off.  Shit happens, you didn\\'t know him that well.  But then the emails come more often, and before you know it, five or six of your classmates are gone.  You\\'ll think of  them  a lot.  And you\\'ll start to dread the emails from your class president, because it might mean another man or woman - a good one - who gave the last full measure of devotion to this great nation. \\n And someday you\\'ll go to a Glee Club concert, a million miles from Annapolis, and you\\'ll hear the Navy Hymn and you\\'ll cry like a fucking idiot because a guy that you knew...a real fucking hero, no shit, died in a helicopter crash, and he had a fiancee and never really got a chance to have his fucking life because he was so busy living for the Corps.  And you\\'ll hate people that think he\\'s a hero because of the way he died - you\\'ll understand that he\\'s a hero because of the way he lived.  And you can\\'t talk to your civilian job buddies - they don\\'t understand.  You can\\'t talk to your wife - she barely understands.  But you will talk to your classmates.  Because they understand. \\n There are easier ways to get an education.  There are easier ways to become an officer.  There are easier ways to make friends.  But there is no other way to have a band of brothers and sisters, extending back into the past and forward into the future, no other way to form your link in the chain to what was and what will be, than to spend four years on the Severn.', \"I paid on my mom's mortgage right after I got out of college until a little earlier this year.  She lost her job shortly after 2008, and because of some physical problems couldn't get another job.  She was 60 at the time. \\n She had refinanced her home at the top of the boom in 2008, like most people, to 'pull money out' through a HELOC.  I don't think she was ever actually underwater...but she might well have been.  Despite living in our familial home for 20 years, she had >20% equity when she lost her job.  She also had just purchased a new car, and had virtually no retirement savings and only a small pension that she wouldn't be able to access until 65. \\n I talked her out of the reverse mortgage that she wanted to take out, and then put, over the course of the past four years, about $50k into her house - covering her mortgage and then some for 5 years.  I didn't want my mom to end up homeless.  It seemed like the right call at the time. \\n I stopped paying this year because she had a tax bill that she refused to show me and then bought a new car with financing after totalling her old one, instead of paying cash (as I had done myself just a few months before).  I had enough and told her I wasn't paying anymore, and that she was on her own to figure out her own finances.  My primary reason was that my family was deprived of that $50k and, frankly, I still don't see any benefit for having paid that money.  My mom was actually probably madder when I cut her off than she would have been if I had never paid her mortgage at all.  I was mad and hurt because she kept hiding expenses and refusing to come clean about exactly what her situation was, even after I had invested $50,000 into her health and safety.  And as importantly, my wife and I didn't get the benefit of that money towards our own financial independence, someday. \\n What's my point?  I don't really know, actually.  Except that by 'trying to help' I actually just perpetuated an unsustainable issue.  I could easily have paid off her house, eventually...but I couldn't fix the underlying issues that kept her from going back to work (and also kept her from preparing herself for retirement).  My mom was financially irresponsible, and I allowed my love for her to blind me to the fact that I wasn't 'helping' her, I was enabling her. \\n I've written in several places before that, ultimately, your parents, and their poor decisions and their poor planning, ultimately aren't your problem.  I hate to phrase it that way, and I certainly would encourage you to gift (not loan...gift) your money to your parents if you think that it won't hurt your own finances too much and to 'fulfill your duty' to your parents, financially.  But I would also urge you, very strongly, to figure out what your limits are, here.  And what things you want to see from your parents as a result.  It's  not  beyond the pale to say that you will only help if your mom goes back to work.  It's  not  beyond the pale to put a time limit on your contribution.  And it's  not  beyond the pale to  not  help your parents, regardless of 'whether you can' or not. \\n If you want, pay them back for whatever they helped you with in college.  Pay them interest.  Pay them more money on top of that, if you'd like.  But ultimately, your parents have made decisions, and failed to make decisions, and they have to live with the consequences of their actions.  You can't 'fix' that, not with all the money in the world. \\n Your parents situation doesn't sound too bad...but again, I would focus on setting limits and being prepared to stick to your guns.  Maybe you can help with your brothers' colleges instead of being responsible for a mortgage?  It's a better analog for the help your parents gave you, and a much shorter time frame.\", \"Great questions - there is some evidence, especially based on Europe right now, that negative interest rates are in fact possible - for how long and how does that effect the world of finance, we are just starting to see, but for the most part 'negative' and 'zero' have been virtually interchangeable. \\n As for the 'how long'...well, wouldn't we all like to know.  The Federal Reserve makes that determination (at least for the overnight funds rate) based on a wide variety of data - and they seem to be pointed towards a raise (from zero) sometime in May, June, or July, assuming all of their indicators continue to be at their targets. \\n It's worth pointing out that the overnight Federal Funds rate may or may not directly lead to increased rates in other parts of the economy.  Traditionally this has been so - but since the end of quantitative easing (a program by which the fed actually bought mortgages and treasury debt, in order to artificially lower rates even further) in May/June of last year, most models predicted a relative increase in market-wide interest rates.  For the last six months of 2014 (and indeed, the first parts of 2015) we've instead seen a decline - the 10 Year T-Bond, a nice proxy for inflation, at one point was trading at a yield of 1.68%, from about 2.82% in April of 2014. \\n So the long answer is - if the Fed raises rates, it will probably be in May, June, or July, and that could easily drive up interest rates across the economy.  But the real answer is - nobody knows.  The market does fluky things, and especially right now, with interest rates so low for so long, we're in uncharted territory.  The 'market' and everyone's models, have already hit the outer limits a couple of times.  So....maybe?\", \"Reality is that nowadays, with other electronically steered systems and better technology/fusion capabilities, Aegis isn't terribly special (ask the Chinese, who have their own version). \\n When it was built, as /u/Timmyc62 mentioned, the electronically steered radar was a  very  big deal.  Essentially, because the system 'rotates' as fast as the electrons can bounce, the 'scan times' are a lot faster than traditional radars. \\n The other piece is that the software welded on to the hardware (SPY is the radar - surface based, electronically steered radar, while Aegis is actually the total package, including SM-2, SPG-62s weapon control system, etc.), which can automatically detect, classify, and even engage, depending on how you program it. \\n You can, with Aegis, completely remove 'the man' from the loop, and let the computer defend the ship, which is anti-ship missile defense, is a revelation.  With a conventionally steered radar array, you might not even realize a missile was inbound until it hit.  With SPY, in the same situation, with the system configured to protect the ship, you could conceivably get multiple salvos of missiles off against an inbound. \\n In the real world, mostly the software makes it easier for the operator to focus on tactically significant issues - so you can set the system to understand what the flight profile of a commercial airliner is, a helicopter, a private plane, etc.  Once you get those identified (which in early versions of Aegis still had to be done manually), the military aircraft stand out like a sore thumb. \\n BMD is a cool function, but it's mostly a product of the processors and the radar - all the engagement stuff had to be 'added in' later.  Later versions of Aegis are more capable in anti-air warfare, too...but the biggest piece was that Aegis was the first real weapons systems to be capable of hitting an incoming missile with a missile.

Since we have no idea when you bought VEXMX, we can only calculate 1 year return by looking at the difference between the price now & the price 1 year ago. This is exactly what  Google  &  Yahoo  does; I had our data analyst verify that our performance data matched there's. \\n The key issue is we don't know when you entered your position and what you did with your dividends (which affects your return calculation) so we can't use that in our return calculation. If you want your return calculation to be accurate then you should either: \\n \\n Connect your brokerage account to Sigfig  - this will pass all transaction info to us so our system knows the price & date at which you bought VEXMX(your cost basis). It also tells us what you did with dividends & distribution which is important. \\n Enter transaction information manually  - every-time you buy a holding, you could enter the cost & date manually. This includes every-time you re-invest dividends. This requires a lot of time which is why most of users choose to connect their brokerage. \\n \\n The Morningstar total return is being calculated making a lot of assumptions on your behavior. Here's their definition of trailing total returns from their website ( \\n > Total return includes both income (in the form of dividends or interest payments) and capital gains or losses (the increase or decrease in the value of a security). Morningstar calculates total return by taking the change in a fund's NAV, assuming the reinvestment of all income and capital gains distributions (on the actual reinvestment date used by the fund) during the period, and then dividing by the initial NAV. \\n The key here is that Morningstar is calculating 1 year return assuming the following things: \\n \\n You are re-investing capital gains distributions back into the mutual fund the same day \\n You are re-investing dividends back into the mutual fund the same \\n \\n We don't assume this in your investing performance because we have no idea when you bought VEXMX or what you did with distributions. More importantly, our data indicates a large % of users actually don't re-invest mutual fund income so it'd be a mistake to assume this.\", 'I work at Sigfig, which is a robo-advisory similar to Betterment. \\n The first point I should make is that as you\\'ve mentioned, there\\'s no crazy secret sauce to any service like Betterment, you can replicate what a service is doing (even tax loss harvesting) but many people sign-up because it saves you time & prevents you from making behavioral mistakes.

There are a lot of 'rationalist' themes present in various Discworld books, and as such some of those books are very definitely worth a read for people interested in 'rational' literature. \\n MOST of Terry Pratchett's work qualifies as deconstructionist - deconstructing and subverting popular tropes of everything from genre fantasy to modern day institutions to popular culture of all sorts \\n Finally, most of Pratchett's books are really worth reading, even those non-rationalist books. The worst of them is 'decent and readable', while the best are some of the funniest, most poignant, and most intelligent fantasy ever written in English. It's really good stuff, in short. \\n For reference, the big chart of suggested [Discworld reading order]( is a really good resource when deciding what to read next. \\n For a rationalist, there are two main series that are rationalist in some sense - the Watch series and, to a lesser extent, the Witches series. That said, the best entry point for the books as a whole for general reading is Small Gods. Small Gods is a mostly independent novel from the rest of the series, and the characters and specific location within the overall setting are not revisited, making it a good book to read at any point; it also is extremely strongly written and interesting. There is some interesting analysis of how a phenomenon similar to the LW affective death spiral causes an organization to become devoted to self-perpetuation over it's nominal goal, and some interesting commentary on religion as well as some interesting planning and plotting, but it's not very rationalist overall. \\n From there, arguably the most rationalist and one of the most interesting sets of stories is the Watch Novels, starting with Guards! Guards! In these novels, each novel is mostly structured as a mystery, and opportunities for the author to drop hints beforehand, and for characters to figure things out, both abound - the stories are mostly (with exceptions being to some extent the first and the last two last books) puzzles that can be solved beforehand. Night Watch in particular is exceptionally well-written, and if not extremely rationalist in terms of being a puzzle-solving plot it does show an intelligent protagonist using limited resources very effectively. \\n One warning: Other than the Watch books, the first book (or in the case of the Rincewind books, first two or even arguably three books) are weaker than the others in their set. They were written at the start of the Discworld, before Pratchett had as firmly defined setting elements and style, and it causes them to be off-putting. However, if you get to (Faust) Eric, Witches Abroad, Soul Music, or The Truth and are still not enjoying yourself, you should probably give up on that sub-series entirely. \\n The Witches books have some rationalist elements as well. In particular, some of the characters are particularly keen observers of human nature and illustrate vividly how people tend to think, albeit not in particularly scientific terms. They are not usually puzzles or mysteries, though, with the noticeable exception of Maskerade, which definitely is. These often examine and deconstruct the intersection between fiction and people, i.e. how people's beliefs and thoughts in/about fiction influence them. \\n The Rincewind novels are entertaining but basically antirationalist - everything is madcap adventures of an incompetent wizard, who gets through by luck rather than skill, and who has no ability to be predicted beforehand because nothing is foreshadowed. Can occasionally be really funny, but not nearly as easy to recommend as the other series. \\n The Death novels are somewhat interesting from a transhumanist perspective as a portrayal of death in a not-strictly-negative light, but again are not particularly puzzles and often don't have any particularly illuminating bits about human thought/nature. They are often gorgeously written, however, and are definitely worth a read on that basis alone. \\n The Industrial Revolution is mostly quite standalone, and in that series The Truth stands out as being particularly rationalist in terms of being a puzzle to solve. To a lesser extent, so is Going Postal. Both are defined by protagonists who intelligently use resources to solve problems. \\n Of Pratchett's non-discworld books, Strata and Dark Side of the Sun are both sci-fi adventures that imitate Rincewind in lack of foreshadowing and predictability in favor of luck and random chance, and are not really worth reading, being substantially clumsier in execution. Good Omens is an amazing collaboration between Pratchett and Gaiman, but the target of a great deal of it's deconstruction (mainly Christian escatology, with some general Christian theology) is the sort of thing that most readers of this review already don't bother to even consider taking seriously. However, it is some of the most funny and amazingly well-written fiction Pratchett ever produced, so I strongly recommend Good Omens. The fact the overall message of Good Omens is very pro-humanist helps. Pratchett's remaining works are mostly ignorable, but Nation in particular is probably worth a read. \\n Suggested 'most rationalist' books: \\n \\n Guards! Guards! \\n \\n Men At Arms! \\n \\n Feet of Clay \\n \\n Jingo \\n \\n The Fifth Elephant \\n \\n Maskerade \\n \\n The Truth \\n \\n Going Postal \\n \\n \\n However, most of the non-rationalist books are still definitely worth a read, and not reading them would IMO be a mistake. \\n The last few Discworld books (starting with Unseen Academicals, IMO) are not up to par with earlier books. I suspect this is as a consequence of Terry Pratchett's early onset Alzheimers. \\n The Science of the Discworld books aren't anything special - they offer no insight that is not offered better elsewhere in the nonfiction segments, and the attached fiction segments aren't particularly well written. That said, if you haven't read any popular science books before they may have something interesting to offer you.\", \"In theory a trusted advisor acts as a regent, or several as some sort of regency council. In theory it might be supposed to be a good governor or senior statesman; In practice, well... a far better writer than I [wrote]( about how it often seems to be people like the prospective monarch's mother: \\n > Regency councils are historically about the least stable form of government imaginable. Unless everyone has truly commendable morality, either the king kills the regent and seizes power, the regent kills the king and starts a new dynasty, or some third party kills the regent and becomes the new regent.

In this case I\u2019m not sure who exactly is supposed to decide whether he\u2019s an idiot or psycho, and apparently neither were the Russians, because they crowned him Czar in 1547 . Ivan was okay until his wife died, at which point he became paranoid and started executing the nobility for unclear reasons, destroyed the economy, and burnt and pillaged the previously glorious city of Novgorod (part of his own kingdom!) with thousands of deaths.According to some sources: \\n >>Ivan himself often spent nights dreaming of unique ways to torture and kill. Some victims were fried in giant frying pans and others were flayed alive. At times, he turned on [his death squads] themselves, and subjected their membership to torture and death. In a fit of rage, he murdered his own son; however the guilt of this act obsessed him and he never recovered. \\n >Our story does not end there! Ivan died of a stroke, leaving the throne to his intellectually disabled son. Here at least the system worked \u2013 brilliant statesman Boris Godunov was installed as regent and ruled pretty well. He did, however, eventually seize the throne \u2013 likely because if he had not seized the throne everyone else would have killed him out of suspicion that he might seize the throne. He died, there was a huge succession squabble, and thus started the Time of Troubles, whose name is pretty self-explanatory. \\n >[...] Charles II Habsburg of Spain (not to be confused with various other Charles IIs). A strong contender for the hotly contested title of \u201cmost inbred monarch in history\u201d, Wikipedia describes him like so: \\n >>Known as \u201cthe Bewitched\u201d (Spanish: el Hechizado), he is noted for his extensive physical, intellectual, and emotional disabilities\u2014along with his consequent ineffectual rule\u2026 \\n >>Charles did not learn to speak until the age of four nor to walk until eight, and was treated as virtually an infant until he was ten years old. Fearing the frail child would be overtaxed, his caretakers did not force Charles to attend school. The indolence of the young Charles was indulged to such an extent that at times he was not expected to be clean. When his illegitimate half-brother Don Juan Jos\u00e9 of Austria, an illegitimate son of Philip IV, obtained power by exiling the queen mother from court, he covered his nose and insisted that the king at least brush his hair \\n >As Charles\u2019s father died when Charles was 3, he was given a regent \u2013 his mother (another case in which the most qualified statesman in the land is the monarch\u2019s mother! What are the odds?!) But when his mother died, Charles took power in his own name and ruled for four years. His only notable achievement during that time was presiding over the largest auto-da-fe in history. He died at age 39. Again quoting Wikipedia: \\n >>The physician who practiced his autopsy stated that his body \u201cdid not contain a single drop of blood; his heart was the size of a peppercorn; his lungs corroded; his intestines rotten and gangrenous; he had a single testicle, black as coal, and his head was full of water.\u201d As the American historians Will and Ariel Durant put it, Charles II was \u201cshort, lame, epileptic, senile, and completely bald before 35, he was always on the verge of death, but repeatedly baffled Christendom by continuing to live.\u201d \\n >Oh, and thanks to the vagaries of self-interested royal dynasties, his passing caused a gigantic succession struggle which drew in all the neighboring countries and caused hundreds of thousands of deaths.\", \"There's stats called strength, intelligence, and agility for each hero.

I finished reading the Kindle version late last night, and I wanted to start a discussion thread for it here. [Amazon link to the novel]( \\n I don\\'t intend to spoil major plot points in this OP in cleartext. If you haven\\'t tried The Laundry Files yet, you really should. The Laundry Files are a sort of urban sci-fi/fantasy series focused on a secret UK government department that tries to prevent Lovecraftian horrors from invading our world and killing everyone. You can try his Laundry Files stuff with [two free short stories and a novella on Tor.com]( It\\'s very soft sci-fi, with a ton of really good humor, and occasional Lovecraftian horror. It also tends to have riveting action sequences and really good writing of combat and conflict. The novels are also always fast-paced and well plotted. \\n The Laundry series has a lot of continuity stuff from book to book - the stories are best read with having read all previous novels. In general, this book is perhaps a little less connected to previous books than most of the Laundry Files have been, as it follows two different main protagonists: a new character and a character who was previously not the main protagonist in the novel they showed up in previously. The protagonist of the first Laundry files novels, Bob Howard, is a background character who gets no screen time at all - which is only a little disappointing, because the newer characters are really quite compelling too. Still, on the whole I recommend reading from the start with The Atrocity Archives; you should  definitely  especially be reading The Rhesus Chart before this book, as that book\\'s finish forms a lot of the setup to this book, and this book extremely thoroughly spoils that one. \\n In a lot of ways, this book felt like a return to form for me. In most entries in the Laundry Files, Stross mixes in a different genre - The Jennifer Morgue mixed in James Bond spy thriller stuff, for example. Stross\\' most recent previous work in the Laundry Files, The Annihilation Score, was an effort to mix in the Superhero genre into his fiction, and I felt that on the whole it was not nearly as successful or as well done as his other works (indeed, The Annihilation Score was my least favourite of his Laundry novels). It\\'s a pleasure, therefore, to find that The Nightmare Stacks is a definite improvement and may just be my favourite book in the whole series (hard to tell - I\\'ve read every other book in the series at least twice, and I sort of tore through this one very fast, which makes it harder to judge. I am starting a reread of the entire series). I really enjoyed Stross\\' story this time round. If you tried The Laundry Files before and hated it, this is unlikely to change your opinion any (it\\'s not a huge departure from what the other books have been, or anything). However, it\\'s a very well executed version of his formula. \\n In some ways that The Nightmare Stacks is an extended tribute to the late Terry Pratchett - Stross begins with a dedication that reads \"IN MEMORY OF TERRY PRATCHETT, WHO SHOWED US ALL HOW IT\u2019S DONE\", and his style is a little different than normal and specifically includes many, many footnotes. Finally, his book\\'s plot resembles a little a couple of Pratchett novels:  Titles of Pratchett Books that Nightmare Stacks shares plot elements with - spoils plot a fair bit . The footnotes tend to be quite funny and very much in the Pratchett style. I think that the humour of the Laundry Files shows through very well in this particular novel, and it\\'s the second funniest Laundry Files novel (The Rhesus Chart beats it thoroughly, but that book is actually sidesplitting).', \"I have read most of Gaiman's work. \\n Firstly, if you have any interest in comics at all, you owe it to yourself to check out his Sandman comics series sometime (he wrote, others illustrated/etc). It is great and wonderful.  That said, those are rather outside the bounds of the this subreddit. \\n His work with Pratchett, Good Omens, is a great starting point. It's unique, funny, interesting, and relatively short. That said, the book borrows more from Pratchett stylistically than Gaiman. Of Gaiman's solo works, I'd recommend starting with American Gods. American Gods is one of Gaiman's best works - it has a lot of his best writing in it. Then I'd continue with Gaiman's short stories and poetry in Smoke and Mirrors or Fragile Things. Finally, I would check out his other stuff - he has a couple books that got made into films (Coraline and Stardust) where the book version was superior IMO. He has a TV miniseries called Neverwhere that got turned into a book - the miniseries has better pacing and a sense of urgency and tension that the book lacks (to it's detriment), but the book has a number of elements that didn't make it it into the TV series, so I'd recommend checking out both of them. His Graveyard Book is a modern day homage/adaptation of the Jungle Book, and it's pretty great even for adult readers, so you should go check that out. Finally, Anansi Boys is a sort of followup to American Gods in a way but isn't as good IMO. \\n The most favorable qualities of Gaiman's writing: \\n 1) Uses language well - stylistically very competent and interesting writing. \\n 2) Maintains pacing and structure to all works (short and long) very well. \\n 3) Very interesting side characters and non-narrator characters. \\n 4) Interesting and unique plot/setting elements, settings, etc. \\n 5) Uses a wide variety of different styles of exposition and narration from different viewpoint characters to great effect. \\n Bad bits: \\n 1) Narrator often (but not always - see e.g. Good Omens) has a narrator who is less interesting than those around him. Typically allows reader to immerse/project themselves onto the narrator more, but may irritate some readers. \\n 2) Sometimes has really horrifying/disturbing stuff in his stories.\", \"On huskar, he doesn't have a real slow until he gets his ult - and when he has that, he typically uses it to initiate and then the enemy typically won't be able to break contact before one or both heros are dead, so more slow is pointless. I wouldn't get it on him. \\n The way it works is that slow  gets much better  with more slows until you hit the 100 ms minimum, and when you have more movespeed bonuses. Heros like Ogre benefit from it because it stacks with Ignite and bringing someone from -26% to -38% movespeed can be the difference between being able to hit every attack CD and the enemy actually being able to break contact and escape alive. Similarly, slark has a huge movespeed buff when his ult is active and has a good method for closing (pounce) but after that if he doesn't have at least some minor slow many heros will be able to break contact and kite him. On Veno, he has a -11-14 % slow, and increasing that 4% will often be enough to make the enemies movespeed slow enough that they can't get away from Veno - it's a tiny difference but it's enough to stack with poison sting, and also helps decrease movespeed a lot when Galed. When hit by gale and lvl 4 sting, normally you are at -64% movespeed, so you only have 36% left. Adding an orb of venom on there will take another 4%, bringing them down to 32%, which is to say it takes 11% of the remainder of their speed.\", \"Also, check out /r/learndota2 if you have any major questions - it's fairly active and gives out pretty accurate answers fairly fast. The 'welcome to dota, you suck' guide for players new to dota is very helpful, i agree. \\n There are some key differences - probably the most major one to adjust to is 'turn rates'; since people don't turn instantly but take a varying amount of time to turn around, you can't keep firing spells off while retreating and kite opponents as easily as in League. This is huge because \\n \\n it levels the playing field between melee and ranged a bit \\n it makes chasing and diving a lot more successful and rewarding, encouraging aggressive play. \\n it means that ranged heros are forced to stand and fight in teamfights more. \\n initially it may make the game feel 'laggy' a little (if you click right behind your hero it turns around before moving, instead of instantly retreating as in League). This perception goes away after a few games. \\n \\n There's a lot of other differences, of course \\n \\n stuns and disables tend to be longer/harder, but spells in general cost more of a smaller mana pool so you have to be very choosy about when to use them early on. \\n items tend to have strong activatable abilities  \\n there is no ap scaling so many very-strong-early heros fall off in effectiveness eventually \\n you can deny allied creeps and <10% hp towers and allied heros under certain DoT spells (changes lane management a lot).  \\n there's a consumable that allows a channeling teleport to any allied building, allowing response to early pushes/dives/etc. \\n all heros are free, you start on a level playing field from the beginning, there is no way to exchange money for in-game power (you can only buy hats/huds/announcers/couriers/wards/etc that change how things look a little, you can't get any actual gameplay-changing benefit from spending $) \\n \\n It's a really fun game, and I recommend checking it out! \\n [this]( alleges to be a guide to Dota 2 for LoL players, but I found it a bit trash-talky and\"]": "Based on the postings, the user is interested in literature, specifically the Discworld series by Terry Pratchett and the Laundry Files series by Charles Stross.

We didn\\'t see a ton of what happened here. We saw the bit with the stairs and the beginnings of Rollins\\' torturing of Ali. (Now that we know that Rollins was so into Charlotte, the stairs thing makes more sense-- it\\'s a sort of perverted revenge for what Cece said Ali did to the girl at the frat house that got Cece kicked out of UPenn.) Anyway, we don\\'t see the rest of their trip. Then, recently, Hanna and Aria went to the same village and encountered Eliza. \\n Because they were tracking Rollins and Eliza had creepy Charlotte dolls of the Liars, we agree with Hanna and Aria\\'s interpretation of what\\'s going on here and that\\'s that Rollins brought Charlotte here and, for whatever reason, Charlotte has been playing with this little girl and giving her the dolls. I\\'m not so sure that Charlotte was the one who had been visiting the community with Rollins over the last five years. I think Ali was. Why would Ali spend time in Amish country with some kid and give her Charlotte\\'s dolls, you ask? Because Eliza is Ali\\'s daughter. \\n Remember when Ali had what she told Cece was a pregnancy scare the summer before she disappeared? What if she actually was pregnant and that was part of her desperation? Ali was afraid of the baby\\'s father and the implication was always that Board Shorts was the father-- only the Liars decided that Board Shorts was Ezra, whom we know didn\\'t sleep with Ali. They stopped looking for Board Shorts when they uncovered that Ezra had a relationship with Ali but, in the process, they never figured out who could have been the father of her baby. It might be Ian, Wilden, or possibly Wren (I love that clue someone uncovered about Wren wearing board shorts in the series pilot) but whoever it is, Ali was afraid of him and she ran. \\n This is why Ali in the early flashbacks is worried about things like money and her family\\'s will. She\\'s pregnant and she\\'s trying to find a way to escape. She makes a plan to fake her death to get away from A and the baby\\'s father, who terrify her. We never see much of what happened to Ali when she was on the run, just the bits with Cyrus and that she had Mrs. Grunwald who could help her. At some point after she fakes her death, Ali has a daughter and names her Eliza because she\\'s obsessed with Audrey Hepburn movies, apparently. Without the ability to take care of her child and worried that she could be in danger, Ali gives her baby to the people in Amish country and continues on the run. \\n This is also why Ali stays in Rosewood before the time jump when, really, you\\'d have to think why the hell would anyone want to stick around after what she\\'s been through? She stuck around to be closer to her daughter. It\\'s why she tries to be a better person and get a job with some meaning by teaching the kids at school. During this time, she visits her daughter and, on one of the visits, gave Eliza Charlotte\\'s dolls, trying to make a bad situation have some kind of non-creepiness. \\n When Ali married Rollins or sometime before then, she took him to Amish country to meet her daughter. That\\'s why they were there on their honeymoon because poor Eliza\\'s stepdad was Rollins. This also might explain why Rollins decided to drive Ali crazy instead of marrying her and killing her for her money. If you consider that Ali got her hands on 51% of The Carissimi Group, then if she married Rollins, then died first, that Ali not being a mother would have meant that Rollins would have inherited the money and controlling interest in the company. So, you have to ask: why didn\\'t Rollins just save himself some time and wait a few months, then have Ali meet with a suspicious \"accident\" or something, if at least part of his motivations were to get at her money for Mary Drake? He didn\\'t because that\\'s not what would have happened if Ali is a mother. Since Ali had a daughter, the money maybe goes to Eliza, at which point Rollins would have really gotten little. When he discovered this, he decided a plan to have control over the money while Ali was alive made more sense for his purposes. The timeline of Eliza\\'s age versus the amount of time that has passed since the summer before Ali disappeared also seems to work, as do hints at other, paralleling plots, like Emily\\'s eggs being taken from her and Spencer having been pregnant with Toby\\'s baby at one point, etc..', \"So, the best way to end a story is usually to circle back to its beginning in some way, right? At first glance, this would seem pretty impossible to do with Lady Mary's story next season. If you believe that Lady Mary accomplished all her early goals by marrying Matthew and giving birth to George, then it is likely that you view her plot since Matthew's death as being largely about personal fulfillment rather than fulfilling an obligation-- that she's been looking for a new man for her own happiness and to be a good father to her son, rather than trying to marry and produce heirs to Downton to keep up her family responsibility. This is true to some extent but not really to all of it. \\n George is only a toddler and the show is going to end in Christmas 1925. That means that it is going to be well into the late 1940s before George is capable of running Downton on his own-- and that's if he survives the Second World War, in which he will inevitably fight. Downton has already seen its share of trouble in changing times-- a main plot throughout all of the seasons. It will be up to Lady Mary to keep Downton running long enough for her son to have something to inherit. Matthew's will empowered Mary to have a say in the running of the estate that she wouldn't have otherwise but I think the show is going to go one step further. I think it's going to circle back to the entail plot from the first series, as it's my understanding that England abolished entail laws in 1925. I think Lord Grantham is going to decide that his health scare from last season means he has to make some decisions about power when it comes to the estate for the next couple of decades, in the event that he should die sooner rather than later. Either the law makes this decision for him or (hopefully) he becomes active in changing it but the end result is that Lady Mary will inherit Downton in her own right by the end of the series. \\n The irony of this is that it then makes most of Lady Mary's plot in the first few series somewhat irrelevant-- all that drama and strife over having to make an heir happen and she winds up with it herself-- but that's part of her story and part of the point of her story. Now that she inherits Downton outright and it will pass along to George, Lady Mary is truly free-- she can marry anybody she damn pleases, for any reason she desires, and she doesn't have to worry that her new husband will attempt to undercut her ability to control Downton because it is outrightly hers under the law. \\n As a result, I don't think Lady Mary actually marries any of these guys. She's for sure not marrying Lord Gillingham, whom she rightly threw over last season (and who is actually a fairly solid bet for the one who killed Mr. Green, which might be why he's still sticking around in the story). She's not marrying that snooze Evelyn Napier. She's not marrying Tom, who is likely going to move back from Boston to help Mary run Downton after something happens like Lord Grantham is really sick this time (prompting this whole plot, possibly.) And she's not going to marry Henry Talbot, as dishy as he is, because please. Lady Mary's not going to marry a race car driver after what happened to Matthew but she for sure will relish the challenge a bit. That leaves Charles Blake as a potential surprise return and he's the only one with real staying power-- the guy she is one day really going to regret passing over. \\n Ultimately, though, the fact that there are a handful of guys with a semi-equal shot at wedding Lady Mary is something of an indicator that the plot isn't going to ultimately be about who she marries-- it's going to be about the freedom and control she's wished for since the first season finally really coming to pass for her. She doesn't really need a father-figure for George if Tom stays at Downton (which he probably will, ultimately) and she won't really need a husband for any social reason. As a result, Lady Mary marries her true love, Downton, and continues on her journey to wind up a sharp-tongued, badass, old dame like her grandmother with more than a few saucy tales under her belt.\", \"Yes, I know they've all said there won't be a crossover between TWD and Fear. It's even possible that they're not just B.S.-ing that. If it were any other show, that'd be ridiculous but since we're talking two shows set almost across the country from one another in a world where going three feet can be deadly, it does make a lot of sense that there won't be stories and/or characters from Fear and TWD that cross over into one another. That means that Fear  technically  isn't a spinoff-- it's more of a companion story. Generally? Companion stories have more than just mechanics or setting in common. There is usually some kind of link between the characters and their stories. On both series, family is the ultimate theme-- it's what the main characters live and die for. So, it wouldn't be improbable then to think that some of the Fear characters are family of characters in TWD, separated from them in the world of the zombie apocalypse. \\n The strongest theory, I think, is the idea that Madison is Rick's sister. Getting the obvious out of the way right away: there's virtually nothing to back this up. This is really more of a musing than a real theory here but oh well. Clues include the following: a) we know exactly nothing about Rick's family life prior to Lori and Carl, so they could do anything they wanted with it; b) Madison and Rick have very similar facial features to the point that they could pass for siblings; c) Madison speaks with a slight Southern accent at times, implying that she's not originally from Los Angeles; d) what little we know of Madison's backstory so far would allow for this to be possible because we haven't gone back far enough with her for there to be anything contradictory. \\n If you view both shows from this perspective, you quickly begin to see that Madison and Rick have a lot in common and even react in similar ways to different situations. More interestingly? There are already things happening in Fear that parallel events in TWD or are blatant visual callbacks to TWD moments. If you look at both shows as one, big story about one family, then instead of just seeing the same stories repeating, you see family members paralleling one another. In the pilot of Fear, Nick has a reverse of Rick's experiences-- Nick sees a zombie for the first time, winds up in the hospital, whereas his uncle Rick woke up in a hospital in the pilot of TWD, left, and then saw a zombie for the first time. That sort of thing... Both shows also feature male-female siblings making their way through childhood (on TWD) and young adulthood (on Fear) together-- Carl & Judith, Nick & Alicia as parallels to Rick & Madison? I might even go so far as to suggest that the way that Rick treats Maggie suggests he's used to having a strong, sibling-like relationship with a woman and that maybe Maggie reminds him of his sister, Maddie. \\n Finally, there's the fact that TWD periodically does flashbacks. We haven't seen this on Fear yet but Fear's only had a few episodes so far and probably will get there at some point. If the writers ever wanted to do something like this or have characters from one show on the other to spice up ratings or viewer interest or whatever in one or both shows, then the easiest way to do that isn't to bring the groups together in the present, it's to connect the characters in the past. A flashback of Maddie going back to Georgia to see her brother or something might add some nice layers to all the characters involved and hook together the stories of both shows into something a little more unified.\", 'In interviews for the final season, Fellowes is quoted a bunch saying that he told Rob James-Collier to be ready for Thomas to be the \"tragic hero\". We\\'ve seen a lot of the tragic but I\\'m not quite sure we\\'ve seen enough of the heroic and, in the final episode, that might mean something big for Thomas. It would be very classic storytelling to have Thomas be the one who basically saves Downton Abbey from some terrible fate. He looks totally happy with himself and wherever he\\'s headed in the CS trailer and that\\'s a huge change since the last couple of episodes. They only have one episode to get him there and I think they\\'ve been building towards Thomas taking some kind of action that allows him to let go of any guilt he has towards past actions and gives the other characters a completely infallible reason to trust him. Pretty much nothing shy of saving the Abbey is going to do this. \\n You could then ask: but why does the Abbey need saving and how could Thomas save it, even if he wants to? Considering that it\\'s the final episode, we know the big theme is going to be that the world has changed in such a way that a lot of the main characters are exiting Downton Abbey. Anna buying a hair dryer for Lady Mary seems to suggest that she & Bates are planning on leaving. Edith is going to marry Bertie and move to Brancaster. The only one who appears to be staying put is Lady Mary. But consider that this is a terrible ending ahead of a potential movie in the future-- there has to be at least one source of conflict you can still mine from the Crawley family and Lady Mary\\'s romantic life is as much the backbone of Downton Abbey as the abbey itself is. This is why Lady Mary just married a guy really wrong for her but what if it\\'s he more than just really wrong for her? What if, really, he\\'s a total hustler trying to swindle Mary and George out of their money? \\n Look at some potential suggestions for this in the story... The first is that the plot doesn\\'t ask for us to care about Henry much at all. The show sells us hard on Bertie Pelham but doesn\\'t actually do much of anything to get us to like Henry. It seems almost purposefully set up to make us feel like Mary was pressured by everyone around her into marrying this guy because everyone else\\'s issues caused them to arrive at a point where they thought it was a great idea. We see more of Mary\\'s independent spirit when in how she subtly approves of and is jealous over Edith\\'s London life during the season than when she chooses again to be married, which seems to then squash that side of her, leading us to feel like this marriage was not a very good idea. Most importantly, though, is that Henry comes pre-packaged with everything he\\'d need as a character to be a swindler. He has no money but he\\'s vain, chilly and ambitious. He has a risk-taking personality (the car racing) which, for all we know, could go hand-in-hand with a gambling problem and a massive heap of debts that no one looked into much because of the whirlwind romance. He has a connection to the Crawleys in Lady Shackleton but he himself is said over and over again to have little in the way of money or prospects. He\\'s  obsessed  with Mary-- not hearing her say no, showing up on her doorstep with a marriage license and convincing her to get married that weekend. Poor Tom has no idea, obviously-- he just sees a dashing, working class, and slightly uppity guy and says \\'perfect for Mary!\\' (and for Tom, who also misses Matthew and having a BFF brother-in-law.) Let\\'s say that Henry Talbot has his eyes on the Crawley family fortune and is working a long con to get it. This would have been foreshadowed by plots in previous seasons-- Lady Rosamund\\'s beau working with the maid to get at her late husband\\'s money and \"Patrick Gordon\" showing up to try to get at the fortune. In both cases, Crawley women were grieving the loss of a man they loved and were succeptible to manipulation. It could be that now it\\'s Mary\\'s turn. Here\\'s where Thomas comes in. \\n Thomas is ever-loyal to Lady Mary and George and Mary knows that. He\\'s also the most oddly objective member of the household, so if he were to overhear something that indicated that Henry weren\\'t on the up-and-up, Mary would be inclined to at least listen to him. Thomas is also good with a great scheme and it\\'s not Downton without one last Thomas scheme. This time, he saves the Abbey but this, as we\\'ve noticed, doesn\\'t change the fact that Lady Mary is married to a criminal. This could result in Mary continuing a pattern of modernity and becoming the first person in her family to get a divorce. She\\'s no stranger to scandal and it would call back to the first episode of the final season, when she\\'s threatened with exposure of her private life and instead of fearing it, she tells that woman to go ahead and do her worst.', \"Yes, I know they've all said there won't be a crossover between TWD and Fear.

Deanna is a woman who off the bat favors Glenn over her own kid, hands authority over to almost all the members of the group, and doesn't even blink when Gabriel-- one of Rick's own people-- suggests that the newbies in her town aren't to be trusted. The only time she seems remotely peeved about anything is over that watchtower. \\n At first I thought she might be closetly racist but her subsequent scenes with Sasha and the way her husband was really kind to Noah suggest that that wasn't the motivation. Her other scenes with Sasha also show that she's empathetic to everything Sasha has going on but she's also trying to find her a role in the community and worries that she can't help her come back around. Which is why it is so weird that the one thing Sasha stands up for and volunteers to do-- something that protects the entire Alexandria community-- is something which pissed Deanna off. \\n I think there could be other communities besides Alexandria that are thriving and Deanna doesn't want anyone in the tower because she doesn't want Rick's group to know that there are other successful survivors out there. Rick's group provides Alexandria with an edge and she's worried that they might decide to leave for a different community if they knew the truth. This would mean that when she was talking to Rick about having banished people from Alexandria and it being akin to certain death, it really wasn't necessarily an act of murder (unless the communities all have some kind of pact where they don't take in any exiles from each other's groups.)\", \"Maggie. \\n Popular character for whom the audience cares? Check. Major death that would cause huge repercussions for all the characters and would have an enormous impact on the plot? Check. A future plot in the comics that could easily be given to a different character going forward? Check. (Sasha and Carol split up Maggie's future storylines.) Heavy foreshadowing of impending death? Check times a million. (Maggie burned Glenn's picture of her. She's the only still-living character to appear in the opening montage of Tyreese's death episode.) \\n Plus, the way Maggie smiled at Judith and the on-going thing between Glenn and Maggie since the prison about whether or not to have a child in this world is something the show would want to explore again before they kill off one of them. Maggie's smile at Judith might be an indicator that Maggie thinks she could be pregnant. Consider that Maggie was extremely against having a child back when the group was relatively safe at the prison but now that they're in some of the darkest times she's ever had and her sister and father are gone, she might be finding some solace in the idea that she and Glenn could have a baby. But the show has kept Judith alive as the symbol of reasons to survive. That means Maggie and Glenn are more at risk-- we don't expressly need their romance to feel a sense of hope in the characters and destroying it would maybe ultimately be more impactful than letting it survive.

Our first knee-jerk reaction was \"No freaking way\" but we did our best to react calmly and think about what is really best for the kids and everyone involved.  It\\'s not like we love the public school system but we were unsure if this would be good for them. \\n It\\'s been a busy couple of weeks full of strategizing carefully written emails back and forth and lots of research.  Finally we had her and her partner come over so we could all talk about it together (including the kids).  I tried my best to put aside my visceral \"she\\'s his ex so I don\\'t like her\" reaction and just see her as another human being who loves these kids and wants to do best for them, even if we don\\'t all always agree on what that means.  The discussion actually went really well and we were all quite civil! \\n In the end I think we are likely doing a one-year trial of homeschooling, although there are still logistics to work out (we want to keep 50/50 balance, so if they are with her during school days we may need to take some extra weekends for balance, also financial considerations).

I know sleep training before 6-months is controversial, I\\'m not here to discuss that. It was a last resort but absolutely the right decision for our family. It worked really quickly and smoothly and we are all happier for it. \\n However, my sleep consultant insists I don\\'t feed him at night. No feeds between bedtime and 6 am. While he has done a few nights where he didn\\'t wake up, or woke with minimal fuss and fell back asleep on his own, most nights he has one long, crying wake period.

The parts you refer to that are referenced in the New Testament are the commands, but not the purity laws. \\n Consider: \\n Matthew 5:17\\n \u201cDo not think that I came to destroy the Law or the Prophets.  I did not come to destroy but to fulfill. \" \\n Romans 10:4\\nFor  Christ is the end of the law for righteousness  to everyone who believes. \\n Hebrews 10:10\\nBy that will we have been  sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ  once for all. \\n Galatians 2:16\\nknowing that  a man is not justified by the works of the law but by faith in Jesus Christ , even we have believed in Christ Jesus, that we might be justified by faith in Christ and not by the works of the law; for by the works of the law no flesh shall be justified. \\n 1 John 1:7\\nBut if we walk in the light as He is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and  the blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanses us from all sin .', \"The author of that article is very confused. I didn't take this passage out of context, because it served more than one purpose. \\n There is a lot to unpack with this, but the starting point is about grace vs law. \\n One of the main reasons for all of the laws is that they were designed to keep the children of Israel clean before God. If God said that certain animals were unclean, eating them would make a eprson unclean. A sacrifice would need to be made to atone for someone's sin, and make them clean again. \\n Then Jesus came. He was sacrificed on the cross to make everyone clean that trusted in Him for their salvation. His sacrifice was made once and for all time. The person who believes in Him is made clean for ever and eternity. Therefore, eating pork (and any other foods) CANNOT make them unclean. In fact, no sin can make them unclean. \\n From this position the only restriction on eating certain things should be about whether they have a negative effect while we still live in this world. For example, you would be unwise to drink the venom of a snake, because it might kill you, but you wouldn't become unclean in doing so, because you have been made eternally clean. Paul tells us that  all things are lawful for us, yet not all things are helpful  is one such issue that would certainly not be helpful. \\n Let's look at a Biblical example of a similar issue: Paul rebuked Peter because he was trying to make  Gentiles live like Jews . Jews certainly would not have eaten meats offered to idols, having considered them unclean.\", 'At what point did they become human? \\n Here are a few interesting articles on the topic: \\n [John MacArthur: Genesis 1: Fact or Framework?]( - an interesting quote: \\n > \"The framework hypothesis is the direct result of making modern scientific theory a hermeneutical guideline by which to interpret Scripture.

Those who embrace such a view have in effect made science an authority over Scripture .\" \\n [Is the Language of Genesis 1 Merely Metaphorical?]( \\n > (1) Chapter one is the foundation for the rest of the book \u2014 which clearly reflects literal history. \\n(2) The recognizable traits of Hebrew poetry are conspicuously absent.

Christ grounds the legitimacy of the marriage covenant upon the creation record. He further argued that the creation of Adam and Eve was at \u201cthe beginning of the creation\u201d \u2014 not billions of years later (  Matthew 19:3-9 . \\n [Is Genesis Poetry or Historic Narrative?]( \\n > As the foundation for all their law, Genesis is not considered by the Hebrews to be poetic, but factual. \\n Something else to ask is this: [Why is it harder to believe that Genesis is a record of actual events than other miracles]( For example, Jesus rising from the dead is not exactly a normal event, a virgin giving birth is against the norm, neither is someone calling fire from the sky or another parting a sea. \\n How about the future? Do you also doubt that judgement day is going to come? To me an event of this magnitude is no less miraculous than creation.', 'If you look at the two verses together: \\n \"Death is the wages of sin. Sin separates us from God\" \\n > So I guess what I\\'m asking here is how would someone like me know when the word \"death\" means actual death as we know it, or a spiritual separation, as you describe in your post? \\n If you think of death in the physical context, there is a separation. Christians (and many others) believe that we have a soul, and that when the human body stops functioning, the soul leaves the body. They become separated. \\n Here is an example in the Bible showing this: \\n Ecclesiastes 12:7\\nThen the dust will return to the earth as it was, And the spirit will return to God who gave it. \\n A good example to show death as separating God from man is in Genesis, at the beginning. Some time after creation, before the fall, God warned man: \\n Genesis 2:17\\n \"but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat of it you shall surely die.\u201d \\n When Adam ate it, he didn\\'t physically die that day, but he did eventually die: \\n Genesis 5:5\\n So all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty years; and he died. \\n On that day in Eden, after Adam sinned, he became separated from God, whereas previously he was in relationship with Him: \\n Genesis 3:8-10\\n 8 And they heard the sound of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God among the trees of the garden. \\n 9 Then the Lord God called to Adam and said to him, \u201cWhere are you?\u201d \\n 10 So he said, \u201cI heard Your voice in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked; and I hid myself.\u201d \\n To further reinforce this, Adam was sent out of the garden of Eden: \\n Genesis 3:23\\n therefore the Lord God sent him out of the garden of Eden to till the ground from which he was taken. \\n Other instances require reading in context. For example, in these passages, I am sure you realise that it is spiritual death being referred to, not physical: \\n Luke 15:24\\n for this my son was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.\u2019 And they began to be merry. \\n Luke 15:32\\n It was right that we should make merry and be glad, for your brother was dead and is alive again, and was lost and is found.\u2019\u201d \\n John 5:24\\n \u201cMost assuredly, I say to you, he who hears My word and believes in Him who sent Me has everlasting life, and shall not come into judgement, but has passed from death into life. \\n Ephesians 2:1\\n And you He made alive, who were dead in trespasses and sins \\n Another context in which death is used, but again, separation is the key. The Bible talks about a second death - that which happens to those who do not believe in Christ at the judgement: \\n Revelation 20:14-15\\n 14 Then Death and Hades were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death. \\n 15 And anyone not found written in the Book of Life was cast into the lake of fire. \\n 2 Thessalonians 1:8-9\\n 8 in flaming fire taking vengeance on those who do not know God, and on those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ. \\n 9 These shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of His power', \"I can look at doing that later, but you realise each of the bullet proints needs properly discussing, and there are lots of them. \\n As a side note, while the Article is titled  'What Does the Bible Actually Say About LGBT Equality?' , many of bullet points do not even discuss this, and where it does, it talks in terms of uncertainty, and uses a lot of presuppositions to reinforce itsself. \\n I'll outline a couple of things, and the later do a full breakdown if I have time. \\n > It is clear that male homosexual activity is condemned in Leviticus, but equally clear that followers of Jesus do not take most of the levitical laws literally. \\n The point being made here isn't 'what the Bible says', but 'followers ignore it too'. Additionally, the author hasn't bothered to try to work out why some parts of the OT are followed and not others. There is a reason for it, we don't just take this position because we feel like it. \\n > It is hard to see how faithful, loving homosexual relationships violate the teachings of Jesus or biblical principles. \\n This isn't talking about what the Bible says. \\n > It is a good idea to be suspicious when culturally powerful interpreters use scripture against the less powerful. The Bible has been misused to resist scientific discoveries, democracy, separation of church and state, the anti-slavery movement, women\u2019s rights and ministry, labor laws, the civil rights movement, and the peace movement. \\n In an article talking about  what the Bible says  to say that  actually the Bible has been misused in the past . So along with NOT saying what the Bible says, they are saying that the Bible shouldn't be listened to (when disproving them). \\n > Celibacy is a calling for some Christians, both homosexual and heterosexual, but should not be demanded of all homosexuals. \\n Where does the bible say this? It doesn't \\n > We have experienced authentic Christian worship with homosexual brothers and sisters, and know that God uses gays and lesbians in Christian ministry \\n This isn't about 'What the bible says' \\n > The Holy Spirit is not limited by sexual orientation. Heterosexual Christian churches are being called by God to move beyond condemnation of homosexuality and uneasy toleration of homosexual Christians. \\n Where does the bible say this? \\n > Homosexual orientation is no more chosen than a heterosexual orientation is chosen. We have found little evidence that people who are exclusively homosexual can change or should try to change. \\n Where does the bible say this? \\n > There is no \u201chomosexual lifestyle\u201d any more than there is a \u201cheterosexual lifestyle.\u201d \\n Where does the bible say this? \\n > Heterosexism is in many ways like racism. \\n Where does the bible say this? \\n > Faithful, monogamous love is spiritually, physically, and socially healthy for homosexuals and heterosexuals. Mutual love, respect, and equality are the marks of non-exploitive relationships. \\n Where does the bible say this? \\n > Lifelong covenanting is good for both heterosexuals and homosexuals and should be blessed by the church. \\n Where does the bible say this?\", \"5) Morality \\n Now let's consider what is probably the crux of your original question. I have covered the other topics to try to give some greater depth to this section. \\n You are probably asking why Christians should or should not behave in certain ways. \\n Why should a Christian not get drunk? Why should a Christian not have sex outside of marriage? Why should a Christian not be involved with homosexual relationships? Why shouldn't we lie, steal, kill? Why shouldn't we have the freedom to do what we want to do regardless? etc. \\n Firstly, let me preface the reason that follow with a quote from Paul: \\n Romans 6:14-15: For sin shall not have dominion over you, for you are not under law but under grace . \\n In Christ we are free from the law. We are no longer held for the consequences of our actions, because Jesus has taken our punishment on the cross. There is now no requirement, or [condmenation]( regarding our keeping of the law, because it has already been kept for us, and paid for us by Christ. \\n So in terms of God's law, we can do as we please and not be condemned. \\n Paul does go on though to say this: \\n 1 Corinthians 10:23  All things are lawful for me, but not all things are helpful; all things are lawful for me, but not all things edify. \\n and \\n 1 Corinthians 6:12 All things are lawful for me, but all things are not helpful. All things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any. \\n Essentially Paul says here that while he is allowed to do anything he pleases, that some courses of action will not have good results in terms of them not being helpful or positive or letting a sinful thing have power over him. \\n Let's examine this a bit further in the context of what we covered previously: \\n 1) Funtional stuff, Laws & society. \\n It is unwise to behave in ways that are bad for you. Why doesn't God want you to go out and get drunk? Because bad things happen to people when they are drunk. \\nWhy doesn't God want you to have sex outside of marriage? You might get an unwanted pregnancy or an STD, but you'll also suffer the emotional consequences of engaging in being bonded to another person and then possibly ripping yourself away again. \\nWhy shouldn't we murder people? Because ending a life is massively destructive on so many levels. \\n Look at all of the commands and you should be able to work out why they were written. There is a cause and effect for all of these things that end up with negative consequences because of the way the world functionally is. \\n You have the freedom to sacrifice you baby with fire to another God, but only bad things will come of it. \\n These functional boundaries are for your good anf the good of everyone else in the world. \\n If you are wondering about why we should keep some laws and not others, that is another issue, but essentially, Jesus says that if we love Him, we will  keeping His Commandments . \\n 2) Decisions & Spiritual Freedom \\n Essentially our decisions are massively influenced by our spiritual position. \\n The difference between a Christian and a non-Christian is that a person who has truly come to know Christ has received into their body the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit has an effect of influencing every aspect of that believer's life. \\n Over time the believer is influenced to do things that are for God's glory and purposes. \\n The non-Christian is in a position that is spiritually influenced by Satan. I am not saying that they are off worshipping Satan in the same way Christians worship God, but as I eluded to earlier, his influence is to get people serving themselves, andto keep them away from Christ as much as possible. This influence can take numerous forms from really obviously evil activities like murder and gang rape to really subtle ones like white lies and not doing good where you had opportunity. \\n One of the other factors here is that sin keeps us separate from God. Before a person has their sin forgiven and removed from them, they cannot have a relationship with God. Sin acts as a barrier between them. This sin prevents them from actually coming to know Him. This sin is part of why some people are blind to God and others see Him clearly. \\n When we become Christians, and there is a situation that we are tempted to sin in, we are 'free' to do so, but if we do it will cause some bad consequences. One of these is placing that barrier back between us and Him. While the barrier of sin here can be removed by true repentance, it does cloud our relationship with Him and affect our further 'decisions'. \\n In terms of refining it down to it's essence. When Christians do good, they can do it for God or for Satan. The Non-Christian does not have the freedom to truly do something for God, because they cannot personally know Him, therefore it cannot be counted as an act of worship. \\n So in summary , I think you probably have the word freedom confused and probably do not understand what it means in as full a sense as you need to in order to answer your question properly, which is why I have written all of this out.\"]": "Based on the postings, it appears that the user is interested in the following areas:\n\n1.

About the only thing kept was the idea of the team and the title, morphed into a thematic question - what is the \\'best\" way to deal with trauma you\\'ve gone through in your past? From there I built out the character\\'s backstory, built a magic system, found along the way that I wanted to write a series, and that the series would in part be an examination of the ways corporations impact life in current society... that led to an antagonist, whose goals led me to more worldbuilding and magic-system building... at some point I took a position on my thematic question, and that gave me the ending. \\n So now I had characters and an ending. Which meant, in a way, that I had a beginning - I had a character who was going to learn that repressing one\\'s guilt over trauma doesn\\'t actually help things. So that meant that he had to start out repressing things, right? So from there I did the notecard thing, just throwing random scene ideas  down as quickly as I could. Some were related to one another, some not. I tried to keep them related to the theme, however loosely, either in support or opposition to the position I\\'m taking. Outside of that, it was just whatever I could think of that would be cool given the magic system and other setup stuff. \\n And then I started arranging those scenes, throwing out the ones that didn\\'t fit... \\n When I was done, I had a pretty tight outline. That, after I started writing, I realized wasn\\'t going to work at all. \\n So I kept the key scenes in the outline - the one where the MC gets involved, the one where the antagonist shows up, a few where the antagonist plies his antagonism, the ending, a few more... and tossed the rest. And from there, from maybe a dozen points, I\\'m winging it. \\n Along the way, I built a good understanding of a lot of stuff in the story, so it wasn\\'t wasted effort.

Joe always tells the truth... but he\\'s put in a scene that gives him no opportunity to lie OR tell the truth. How does his steely will to truth-tell affect what he does when he sees a car careening toward a nine-year-old girl? It does, but in oblique ways. If he believes that telling the truth is demanded by honor, then he\\'s a strongly honorable person, and he saves the girl or dies trying. If he believes that telling the truth is practical because you can\\'t be caught lying, then he\\'s a pragmatist and he\\'s going to evaluate the situation. If he believes that telling the truth is valuable mostly for the reactions, then he\\'s kind of an ass and he might not save the girl. \\n \\n Which leads to another thing - if a character is an avatar of something, it came from somewhere else.

So they\\'d better be damned sure that they\\'re the chosen one if they\\'re going to go on this quest. \\n In the game, if you don\\'t want to go that angle, then maybe just give the characters reasons why it  isn\\'  them -- they weren\\'t born under a summer moon, after all.

I\\'m sure you can make some up. \\n So if you get the characters going down this road -- investigating why they\\'re cursed, and how to lift it -- you can certainly do some good stuff in revealing things with double meanings later on.

And then stop defining, and start writing. \\n Unless you're a Tolkien (and you may be) or are aiming for that level of verisimilitude, you really only need to know what you need to know to tell the story. \\n So if the story takes place across, to make it easy to talk about, western Europe, that's something. But at the same time, it doesn't take place ACROSS western Europe -- it takes place in Paris, and London, and Venice, and a little village between the Rhine and the Rhone. More, it takes place in a particular building in Paris, and in particular alleyways and apartments in London, and in the third stall from the left in the bathroom of a Venice hooker hangout. \\n So define in great detail the specific places you're going to use in a scene. \\n Define in lesser detail the areas surrounding those places. \\n Define in lesser detail still the areas surrounding those areas. \\n Define very vaguely the areas outside of those. \\n Don't define at all except by allusion the areas outside of those. \\n So in our story, we know the stall in the bathroom of the hookery very well. We know the bathroom as necessary to pass through and hear sounds. We know the bar it's in by the noises we hear and the clientele who come in. We might know a little bit about the neighborhood, no more than a word or two. And the canals don't matter at all, because the story isn't using them. And Italy? Other than the general character we want to impart to Italians, who cares? \\n Now, if the client is a gondolier, then we might need to know more about those canals.

He does them favors - but prefers not to let on that he\\'s getting something out of it. \\n In Doug\\'s case, he and Frank may have met earlier in their careers, when Frank was just getting his feet wet in the House - or possibly on the campaign trail. They were as friendly as Frank allows himself to be at that point, and he notices that Doug drinks a bit much. He makes a note of it, doesn\\'t say anything. He knows Doug is good at taking care of things that need to be done; but that the drinking is interfering with his work. He also knows that Doug would be more valuable if Doug were both sober AND indebted to Frank. \\n Now, in order for Doug to not totally reject Frank later when he suggests they sabotage Peter\\'s sobriety, this had to have been genuine - in that it can\\'t be a grand-scale manipulation like they pulled with Peter. Doug would recognize that in a heartbeat. It had to be smaller. \\n Maybe Frank accidentally gives him the wrong information about something (ex. be here at 10 to meet this crucial councilman when he should be there at 7), and Doug screws it up and gets drunk. Doug walks in the next morning, and lies about meeting the councilman. Frank catches him off guard, says he talked to the guy, and the guy never met Doug last night. Doug panics, and startspleading with him. \\n Frank tells him a sob story about his uncle, who, like Doug, was a drinker. (he wouldn\\'t use the same story for Peter, because Peter respected Doug - and Peter grew up in a rough neighborhood with, no doubt, a bunch of functional alcoholics. It works better if Peter sees a model of functional recovery who\\'s accessible.) \\n Doug is ready to be fired, but Frank plays him a bit, and lets him know that yes, he IS disappointed, but he knows that it\\'s not entirely Doug\\'s fault. That Doug is a good, loyal, effective person, and that the drinking is standing in his way. And that Frank could use that loyal, effective Doug - not the other Doug. He offers Doug a choice, and a second chance. \\n Doug knows what Frank is capable of. And he knows that drinking is screwing up his life. He may not take it at first, but then, he comes around - maybe after talking to Claire. He enrolls in AA. Frank supports him, congratulates him, stands up for him and makes his choice feel accepted. Frank\\'ll be the one who makes sure there\\'s sparkling apple cider at the victory parties, just for Doug. And Doug is always grateful to Frank for giving him a second chance, and helping him turn his life around. \\n As a result, Doug confides in, and trusts him completely. Remember, Doug is not a leader; Doug takes orders and executes them. Frank offers to teach him how to play chess, and he refuses because he doesn\\'t know how - and doesn\\'t want to. He wants to be told what to do. \\n In the meantime, Frank has a perfect lieutenant.

The hours hunched over a keyboard or pad of paper, the papercuts, the mental struggles, the loose clumps of hair torn out over problem chapters - that\\'s the currency that gives an idea value, and makes it into something brilliant.

There's less episodes to talk about, less in jokes to find and talk about (than AD, for example), and a pretty wide audience to appeal to (in terms of you subscribes here). Look at subs of shows that have been off the air for a while, like Seinfeld or even King of the Hill.

Different women have very different reactions to this, I can tell you that much. \\n With my current girlfriend, it was the worst because it kept happening literally every time we had sex.  Why she stuck with me I'll never know, but the key thing to remember is there are plenty of things you can do that don't involve all this pressure.

To deny his work ethic, charisma and connection to the fans (just rewatch the night  he cashed in his Money in the Bank contract  just irks those even further, especially against someone like Reigns who doesn\\'t garner anything like that yet, emphasis on yet.  Reigns is already polarizing in a Cena-like way, so he does have that going for him though. \\n \\n I don\\'t even have to go into a full explanation on Bryan and Wyatt as those should be self explanatory in terms of what they\\'re capable of doing.  Bryan just isn\\'t trusted and Wyatt is still on the slow track, but has plenty of potential and has the allure (and mic work) around him to craft any storyline. \\n \\n I purposely listed Rusev last as I\\'d honestly say that he\\'s the closest in terms of someone on the roster where I think Reigns is/should be.  When working with another vet (Rusev/Cena and Reigns/Bryan respectively at Fast Lane), they can hold their own, but that\\'s just it:  to be  the  guy, you should be doing more than just holding up.

Furthermore, they\\'re still developing their abilities on the mic, but I\\'d personally say that Rusev is better even when throwing in random Russian.

Their respective promos on Raw were prime examples of both. \\n \\n \\n >They either go with a Bryan who has been back from Neck Surgery which the future is unclear how his body will handle being on the road again, they go with Reigns who they believe is a future top guy but might be a little early, they go back with Cena who people are just tired of, or they go with someone else like Ambrose or Ziggler who might not be ready either. \\n This ultimately describes the problem and criticism that some are implying when they say that the WWE is headed in a bad, and potentially damaging, direction \u2014 they\\'re not appropriately developing that next wave of stars.  Rollins and Bryan are the only ones that could be maneuvered in that direction without it feeling pushed; Ziggler has been dangled in so many directions that it\\'s never known if it will be maintained, especially after winning a title and then dropping it in such short time spans.  Wyatt is currently in limbo in terms of a direction, but depending on what happens at Wrestlemania with Undertaker, he could be placed on that next tier.  And Rusev is still carrying the US Title around nowhere near that level yet. \\n The only stars on the roster in the next wave that I believe that could \"float\" into the scene without question would be Orton or Sheamus (honorable mention to Miz and Swagger simply because they have been previous champions).  Everyone else is either a tier, or further, away and wouldn\\'t be an expected transition; they all need progression and work. \\n I think a majority of detractors that Reigns has aren\\'t saying that he shouldn\\'t be there, it\\'s just that he shouldn\\'t be there  yet .  He certainly has a look, he\\'s developing the moveset and he has a way to go on the mic, but those aren\\'t qualities of someone that should be  the guy .  If you\\'re still struggling with promos and have to be carried in the ring (we can dispute to what level, but he is still being led), those aren\\'t qualities of someone that should be  the guy .  Of course Reigns isn\\'t going to dismiss the opportunity because if someone hands you the keys, you take them \u2014 it\\'s just that his current resume doesn\\'t embody what it truly takes to be  the guy ... yet.', \"I definitely think you're right about the latter part in terms of being guarded by a 4, but when you really look at his game, it's ultimately his strength that allows him to do a lot of the things that he does.  He blows by the bigger guys that he can pull away from the basket, but he uses angles and his body to get by people that are more athletic than he is, which he'd still be able to do towards the end of his career (assume we don't start churning out more LeBron-like players). \\n And all of that is just to facilitate and hit the open shooters like you mentioned because he makes everyone else around him more dangerous with open shots, but can also finish if necessary once he beats his man.  The only thing LeBron has to do over any offseason besides getting his body in shape for another long season is working on his jumper as that's really the only thing I'd say that separates he and Jordan \u2014 Jordan from 10+ feet out was just as dangerous as LeBron at the bucket.  LeBron shoots ~40% from 10+ feet when he started going jumper-heavy in his shot selection (his average shot distance went up from 12 to 13 feet from '08 to '09), but while the numbers aren't physically available for Jordan (shooting stats to that degree weren't recording until 2000), it's pretty much widely accepted that Jordan's jumper was deadly from mid-range when open.  LeBron is getting there, but still has a little ways to go although it is worth noting that LeBron is better from three than Jordan was but Jordan rarely shot them as much.\", 'That can be the case in some systems, dependent upon who the anchor is of that defense.  Any defense that had that someone of the caliber of Wallace, Olajuwon, Mutumbo, Howard or Chandler (just some quick examples) were generally higher rated defensively simply because the system was to be more aggressive on the perimeter and filter players towards the anchor. \\n Generally speaking, all the guys that you mentioned have respectively worked on their defense (especially Harden since he knew that was an aspect that was preventing him from ascending to another level) and are all on pace statistically for their best year in terms of steals and blocks.', 'Honestly, your argument loses all traction after the statement when you say that Morey \"got rid of Yao\".  Morey didn\\'t get rid of Yao, Yao\\'s foot egregiously cut into his career\\'s lifespan and his forced retirement destroyed the team\\'s plans going forward without our centerpiece.  We have tread water since then and that is to be expected.  How would the Celtics have been before their moves if Pierce had only played 5 games out of the season?  The Mavericks without Dirk?  Look at the Bulls without Rose? \\n Our last \"real\" team was the 08-09 season when we pushed the Lakers to a 7th game in the Conference Semi-Finals and even then, McGrady was hurt.  The lineup at that point became: \\n \\n Brooks / Battier / Artest / Scola / Ming \\n \\n Then as previously mentioned, Yao got injured in the playoffs going into Game 4 against the Lakers.  We threw Chuck Hayes in for Yao and it\\'s been like that ever since.  Neither McGrady or Yao fully recovered from their injuries and we\\'ve had to play catchup with our moves.  They played well to force the Lakers into a 7th game considering what we were able to put on the court, but I still describe the situation as the Lakers not taking the Rockets seriously once we lost the two major pieces of the team. \\n So of course we had no All Stars to draw interest from any other players to come here... they were injured and unable to show anything.  You have to remember that there were legitimate discussions a decade ago on if Kobe or Tracy were the better player, they were both that good then.  Boston realized they had nothing going forward and took a gamble in the same fashion that the Rockets did this offseason; the obvious difference is that theirs paid off mainly due to our coach and then GM of the Timberwolves (McHale) who agreed to the trade for Garnett to the Celtics.  This was just shortly after Allen agreed to go as well and they formed the first \"Big 3\" via acquisition.  Their situation is far removed from ours because we had the pieces for the future, but they literally disappeared (yet they were still on the books further preventing moves) and Boston was in desperation mode. \\n If you want a real analogous situation, look at the Trailblazers.  They had drafted one of the most promising big men in several years into an already up and coming team to have a projected lineup of: \\n \\n Blake / Roy / Batum / Aldridge / Oden \\n \\n Instead, Brandon Roy\\'s knees gave out on him and he disappeared and Oden tragically had an early injury and has obviously never recovered.  That team has been set back significantly as well.  Would you blame their GM for that?  The Rockets have remained buoyant through these last few years either making or narrowly missing the playoffs, but I deem that to be detrimental to the team because we aren\\'t strong enough to win a championship so we need to suffer our terrible season and start rebuilding.  I think Morey finally realized this and took the biggest gamble he could to bring in Howard.  It failed, but now the team has pretty much bottomed out so now we have a lot of young talent and will have to rebuild.  The only move I haven\\'t liked from Morey was making McHale our coach; other than that, don\\'t blame him, blame the injuries.']": "Basketball, sports, wrestling and WWE", "['Not that I\\'m taking the side of the TSA, but think about all of this from a different perspective. \\n Had the government chosen to go with the profiling angle instead of the invasive procedures (keeping in mind that in this instance, the RapiScans wouldn\\'t even be on our mind), how would American citizens react?

My Mother is likewise extremely religious and (for lack of a better word) homophobic.  My father, though also considerably religious, is not as devout, quite intelligent, and realistic.  I come from a large family, and my oldest sister initially came out as being an atheist and a lesbian.  She also would later follow a profession related to my father's, rather than my mother's.  Besides my mother's problems of dealing with my sister's atheism and homosexuality, she ultimately, like your mother, it seems, came to feel that she had failed as a mother because of her children's seeming rejection of everything that she personally held to be important.  (more annoyingly for the rest of the siblings, my mother then decided she wouldn't make the same mistakes with her remaining children and redoubled her efforts to devout-ize us). \\n Later on I eventually also admitted to my mother that I was an atheist (and coincidentally it was confirmation that made me realize I couldn't put up with the church's bullshit anymore), and started a long series of email-based debates with her.  Not a single of these debate sessions has not resulted with her eventually having an emotional breakdown, despite my best efforts to be nonconfrontational and diplomatic.  However, she eventually made peace with the idea, though I'm sure she still tells herself that I'm just going through a phase or something, and that I'll find god sometime in my life. \\n Anyway, I was getting off topic, sorry.  My sister's relationship with my mother went downhill very quickly after she came out of the closets, and my dad, though a swell guy, was completely unable to handle two upset, emotional, simultaneously PMSing women (I'm not going to explain how I know that, but they tend to be in sync).  That was my job.  I was the middle child, and I had always been the family diplomat.  So whenever my mom and sister fought, they would both later come to me to vent and ask for advice. \\n So...  yea, that's how I can relate, but the point I originally set out to explain didn't really have much to do with that.  Lemme try this succinctly. \\n In the feud between my sister and my mother, the single most powerful conflict was that it wasn't just about religion, and wasn't just about being gay, (although it took my mother a very long time to come to terms with those).  What really continually upset my mother was her her belief that she had given her all for decades to raise her daughter in the best way she new how.  She had spared no expense, no elbow grease, and no blood.  And she was devastated that her beloved daughter had then turned around and flatly rejected every value that was important to her (my mother). \\n > and how stupid it is that such minor, meaningless things can cause so much drama \\n True, ultimately, they are minor, meaningless things, for you.  And they might not be as important to your mother as you think, either.  But what means everything to your mother is rejection. \\n Here's what happened, partially by luck, partially through my hunch, and it really went a long way to get my mother and sister back on speaking terms.  My sister did two things. (Hey, I couldn't manipulate my mom into taking the initiative, but it could serendipitously help you as well.) \\n 1) My sister had to write a paper on ethics.  We she decided to write about the rich ethical legacy she had inherited from her parents, complete with tales and anecdotes from her childhood, which, given how much my father worked, mainly involved my mother.  Later on, I helped her develop this into a letter to my mother, explaining all the things that my mother had taught my sister, that she not only accepts, but uses, and is thankful for.  Small things, unrelated to religion and sexuality.  Things like knowing the quickest way to change diapers, tricks to get the most bang for your buck when grocery shopping, teaching her to cook, teaching her to not judge a book by its cover, to look both ways before crossing the street, being responsible for her own health and safety, and learning what makes someone a good significant other and possible future mother.  From my dad I later found out that my mother took two days off life and alternately cried and moped around the house, but afterwards she was much better. \\n This got my sister and my mother back on civil speaking terms.  A bit later, they agreed to sit down to a pow-wow, moderated by both my father and me, and we outlined what my mother and sister were allowed to do to, and expect of each other. \\n The second thing that really helped was the when my sister had to ask my mother for help.  You see, my mother is a really good swimmer.  She was also a swim teacher for years.  My sister had virtually been a cat.  She had a bad aversion to the water.  It so came to pass that for my sister's job, she ended up in the position of having to get a swimming competency certification.  She was also going to be spending a few weeks in town this summer visiting, and she managed to summon the courage (with my help, and I suspect some liquid courage as well) to ask my mother to teach her how to swim. \\n My mother was thrilled, and put down everything to devise a two-week swimming boot-camp.  Since then, they haven't had any major fights.  I'm keeping my fingers crossed. \\n But back to reiterate.  (I'm terrible at being pithy, sorry)  From the way you describe it, it seems your mother feels like she's been rejected by her daughter.  My advice would be to take the initiate, and try to let your mother know, in a nonconfrontational way, that though you don't agree on a couple things, there are many, many things you still share in common, many, many things that your mother did while raising you that you accept and are thankful for, and (maybe) still some things you could still need her help for. \\n I wish you luck.  Powerful though it be, religion is still a sucky reason to cut off family. \\n Ah yes, and congratulations on your wedding!\", \"Those who have been saying Hinoeuma, \u4e19\u5348\u3001\u706b\u306e\u3048\u99ac, or Fire Horse are correct.\\nThe Japanese Follow the old Chinese zodiac calender with a few slight changes.  Now you all might know about the 12 animals of the Zodiac (Rat, Ox, Tiger, Rabbit, Dragon, Snake, Horse, Sheep, Monkey, Rooster, Dog, and Boar)  , and they rotate once a year so each cycle takes 12 years.  What you probably don't know is that there is a second concurrent cycle of 5 elements: Water, Wood, Earth, Fire, and Metal.  These five elements rotate once every two years, so the cycle repeats every 10 years.  Thus, years ending with 2 and 3 are Water, 4 and 5 are Wood, 6 and 7 are Fire, 8 and 9 are Earth, and 0 and 1 are Metal. \\n Given that I was born in 1988, I am an Earth Dragon, which is baddass.  Now, since there are 5 elements, and the animal zodiac refreshes every 12 years, there are 60 years between two years with the same animal/element combination.  since 1988 was an Earth Dragon year, to find other badasses like myself, I should either look for people born in 1928, or wait until 2048 for the lovely new badasses to be born. \\n The years 1906, 1966, and (next) 2026 are the years of the Fire Horse. \\n Now, there are tons of superstitions about all sorts of animal/element combinations, like the fact that,  in my humble opinion, Earth Dragons are baddass.  But Fire Horses get the short end of the stick.  They get stuck with a really crappy superstition. \\n There are many legends and stories about the Fire Horse, but in essence, they were thought to be free-spirited to the point of rebelliousness (remember these are highly Confucian societies), rash, and irresponsible with money.  The men are bad, but have the social authority to be able to take care of themselves.  The Fire Horse women, being relegated to wives and caretakers, would chafe under their yoke and bring ruin to their families and the early death of their husbands. \\n Depending on who you ask (as there are many version of the myth around) sometimes the fire horse would simply be cursed with bad luck, and her family would suffer for it.  Sometimes the fire horse would be an out of control, impulsive, and irresponsible wife, neglecting the children, draining the family's coffers, and causing her husband to die early from stress.  In yet other versions, the Fire Horse would be unable to deal with the restriction of being a proper wife, and murder (or in some versions eat) her family, particularly her husband.  None of this is very pleasant, and so no one would want to marry themselves or one of their sons to a Fire Horse.  The Fire Horse would be a pariah, outcast from normal marriageable life and viewed with suspicion by others. For example, there is a story of a Fire Horse burning down Edo (Modern-day Tokyo) in the 17th century.  Of course, with most buildings made from wood (especially pine, with ceder being preferred) and paper, these cities were quite liable to conflagration.  After the fact, it was blamed on a Fire Horse, because hey, it must've been her fault, right? \\n Anyway, so this myth in particular has been around on for a while in Japan, and every time the year of the Fire Horse comes around, people were extra careful to not get pregnant so as not to be cursed with a Fire Horse Daughter.  Given the structure of the life cycle in Japanese Buddhism (where dead babies get to skip the afterlife and get born again straightaway) and the shichigosan (7-5-3) ceremonies (during which a child is progressively recognized as a member of society and unlikely to randomly die, i.e. SIDS) in Japan, infant mortality (and in some case infanticide) were not considered as tragic as it is in the European/Christian religious version of reality. \\n Now, given that the last Hinoeuma year was 1966, and right after WWII, when Japan was supposedly modernized and recovering, when that superstition was still strictly observed, it became a source of international embarrassment to the Japanese.  There is also a batch of current Fire Horses, in their late 40s (46 or 47), who are very politically active, and have even formed a sort of a watchdog group to protest perpetuation of the myth in popular culture.  The creator of Pokemon was actually lauded for using the image of a fire horse (Ponyta \u30dd\u30cb\u30fc\u30bf#77, and Rapidash \u30ae\u30e3\u30e9\u30c3\u30d7#78) in a positive, friendly, caring light.  The Pokemon franchise maintains that those two Pokemon were based off the fire horses of European myth, particularly the Greek God Helios.  It is quite unlikely, however, that the creator, Satoshi Tajiri ( born in 1965 ) was ignorant of the Japanese myth. \\n I apologize that on the Internets there is a dearth of information about Hinoeuma in English, but here's a few places you can look: \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n And if you are adventurous, here's a Japanese site on the subject: \\n \\n Also, the work of Futoshi Kinoshita, Professor of Japanese Demographics, Culture, and History, Tsukuba University, a National Japanese University.\"]": "Based on the reddit postings summarized, the user is interested in multiple areas including hypnosis, music composition, relationship advice, family dynamics, and Japanese culture/history.", "[\"If an outfield player makes a mistake, like losing posession on his own or making an inaccurate pass, it isn't really the end of the world and tends to happen quite often.

Basically, Formula 1 and other big motor racing series are relatively safe these days, but you don't need to go further back than the 70's to find a time when death was a natural part of it. This book is about Sid Watkins' crusade to improve the safety at the circuits (swapping flammable hay bales for more suitable solutions, disallowing fuel tanks to surround the cockpit, restricting spectator areas e.t.c.) and in developing rapid response medical rescue (a medical car, hospitals and helicopters on standby the whole race weekend, medical centres at the circuits, teaching  Ayrton Senna . \\n Includes detailed, and very interesting accounts of brokering deals to get all this safety into sport, where the culture was pretty much where you accepted the risk of death.

Towards the end of winter, she'd recovered sufficiently so that she could walk without crutches, and wanted to join us for a surfing session. \\n To put this into perspective, she'd effectively missed out on half a years' worth of practise, and all of the other girls had pretty much given up on surfing at this point.

Despite all this, all the guys (8 of us) took her out one day, found a spot with no other surfers around and pretty much dedicated the entire session to her. We caught waves of our own, of course, but she was inundated with help and encouragement, which in turn lead to her catching and standing up on her first wave. Several times!

If the latter is true, however, you're shooting yourself in the foot sticking around somewhere that you aren't being properly valued. \\n The biggest mistake most employers make is undervaluing their key employees.  If your employer is making this mistake, that's their problem.  Sadly, the most common way to get your compensation anywhere near your worth is to hop jobs.  Most employers (particularly larger companies) are often far more interested in paying premiums to bring talent in, but opt to stagnate existing high-value employees.\", 'I\\'m not saying you\\'re wrong and I do agree that it\\'s rarely a good idea to code  everything  from scratch.  Having said that, I can think of plenty of reasons to leave the bloat of a pre-existing do-it-all framework behind and code what you need from scratch, depending on the project of course. \\n Additionally, hand rolling your own framework is an excellent way to learn the benefits of using existing well structured frameworks.  This is a learning experience, but I\\'ve found it to be a valuable one. \\n I think the advice that \"there is already a great solution for that and it should be used\" is probably best in many cases, but I think it\\'s also exactly that sort of thinking that curbs innovation.', \"To be clear: This is the kind of thing a person is not likely going to be doing until they've moved up the food chain at least a little bit; you're not going to see junior level techs having their employment terms reviewed by a lawyer, for example (although one might argue at any level it benefits the employee to understand what he or she is actually signing their name to).  It is something that more senior level people might want to consider (and again, return to my statement that the employment process is a negotiation, and businesses are used to this kind of thing, even if you aren't as an employee). \\n An employment lawyer levels the playing field for you.  They typically serve two different functions: Reviewing employment contracts and documents (and helping you to negotiate or helping to negotiate on your behalf, if applicable) and, in the event that things don't go as well as you planned, they serve the function of litigating on your behalf against your employer or former employer. \\n To the former part of that, as it pertains to the hiring process, you would pay someone like this to review all of your employment contracts/agreements and documentation and identify language in those documents that are unusual, favorable, or unfavorable to you.  They would then work with you and the potential employer to negotiate on those points. \\n How much leverage you would have to effect a change in any of this documentation is going to depend a lot on the position in question and how valuable of a prospect you are to that company.  The negotiations for a CTO position are obviously going to be a bit different than the negotiations for a general system administrator, for example. \\n To that end, though, even if changes to your proposed contract aren't an option because of the type of position you're seeking (and the level of available resources to fill that position), it may very well be worth a few dollars to have an employment lawyer review the agreements you are about to sign and highlight any red flags for you.  Yes, lawyers are expensive, but a few dollars spent up front might mean the difference between getting absolutely screwed by your agreements or not.\", \"Absolutely these.

My fix worked as expected, but because I was trying to take shortcuts and pull down my development branch directly in stage, nothing ever actually happened (because I was in the wrong stage release directory, and rather than relying on my well-tested deployment scripts for stage releases, because I was trying to save a few keystrokes in quick testing).', \"he wanted to completely block websites like facebook and other things like that \\n Your boss doesn't understand how knowledge workers function productively and, at a glance, appears unqualified to optimally manage such people. \\n > I understand his point about doing something because when I walk around I see a lot of web browsers getting minimized. \\n No, clearly you do not understand either.  Knowledge workers taking time to allow their brains to reboot from time to time is not a problem for your company unless they are not performing to the level of productivity you expect from them.

It was not fun being a kid in my household for a few years there, until her GP decided to randomly check her TSH levels and realized her thyroid had completely died. She had NO thyroid function and was immediately started on synthroid. It was like night and day, almost instantly. My sweet, laid back, fun loving mom returned and the monster that replaced her faded away. To this day, however, if she misses a dose, the monster creeps back in, so she has to be very diligent about taking her meds. \\n For me, it's been far more complicated.

Mostly because I could just sit in my living room, telling my roommates \"holy crap, I think I\\'ve found the creepiest most socially awkward person of all time!\" To clarify, I\\'m of the opinion that \"missed connections\" sites are a waste of time. If you\\'re into someone, tell them, ask them out, do something. Don\\'t just post about it. That\\'s creepy as hell. \\n Anyway, I visited the site on a weekly basis for a little while, laughing at the awkwardness of the people at my college. Until, one day, I started seeing posts about me (many of them were very obvious). And my asshole friends started commenting on these posts telling people who I was. \\n At first, I thought that the posts were probably just things my friends did to annoy me. And then the day of reckoning came... Someone had posted about me at a Valentine\\'s party near campus. As with all the previous posts, I ignored this one. My roommate did not. He told the person my name and that I was single and they started messaging each other back and forth about me. \\n Unbeknownst to me, my roommate told her that I thought the site was creepy and that she should just come out and say hi. Seeing as I had no idea this was going on, I was rather shocked when a petite girl named Amy came up to me one day before class and blurted out \"your roommate told me you prefer personal interactions.\" To which I responded \"that\\'s...cool... I guess... I have to go to class now.\" \\n She and my roommate continued messaging each other back and forth about me until she found out that I was a smoker. That was a deal breaker for her.

I bring you the new easy to use strategy, Execute Jhin. \\n By building increased critical strike damage marks and quints, Jhin's ultimate combined with IE's fourth shot does approximately 283% damage. Because it is just IE and runes, this isn't something that needs build up. \\n In addition, this means your fourth shot will be doing 133% damage due to the critical strike. Combine this with Duskblade, and if you don't already one hit a squishy, they will most assuredly die to that. \\n You can build increased critical strike damage seals and glyphs, but they offer little bonus. Together, they only make up 14% increased damage, which is a nonfactor considering the quints make up about 17%. \\n The cons of this build are that you lose out on early damage on every other shot than your fourth one due to the lack of AD in your page, meaning your early game will be rather lack luster, but it is a small price to pay once you get your first items, because the increased damage is worth way more than the AD will be. \\n As you might imagine, the only reason why these runes work is due to the natural crit in Jhin's kit, but this may be applied to Miss Fortune's (R) Bullet Time (not guarenteed crits, so not recommended) and Shaco (Q) Decieve. Other champions that make use of crit such as Gangplank can also abuse these as he also has high enough damage to one shot. Master Yi also can build these, though most Master Yi players do not go 100% critical strike and prefer AD or Attack Speed for early pressure. \\n Lastly, I do not recommend using this if you are lower ELO/not good at csing, as it might be rather difficult to last hit without AD. \\n Match History of Game: \\n ^^^PS: ^^^For ^^^the ^^^record, ^^^I ^^^got ^^^no ^^^peel ^^^most ^^^of ^^^that ^^^game ^^^and ^^^had ^^^to ^^^resort ^^^to ^^^not ^^^getting ^^^in ^^^auto ^^^range ^^^until ^^^I ^^^could ^^^have ^^^items. ^^^Most ^^^fights, ^^^4 ^^^people ^^^would ^^^attempt ^^^to ^^^ult ^^^me, ^^^losing ^^^them ^^^the ^^^fights ^^^as ^^^I ^^^wasn't ^^^the ^^^biggest ^^^threat ^^^till ^^^the ^^^end.\", \"I have been playing around with the masteries and runes and I think I have some good points about what to go. I have determined a build that will yield high results under their given situations. \\n \\n This build does not account for high health but low armor targets. \\n This style works due to BC's health boost giving you more damage on Titanic Hydra than you would get naturally with Ravenous Hydra. It also gives Talon decent bulk. \\n In addition, Talon is also able to get a large amount of CDR, and if you get 10% in runes, you max it out. \\n This build is vulnerable to carries that build Lord Dominick's Regards, but who cares? You will kill them anyway. Speaking of LDR, it does function well as a tank killer, but you need to be able to break the armor they carry with something besides the built in Last Whisper. Also, it doesn't stop healing tanks either.\", 'Ok, allow me to clear up some things. \\n In Kalista\\'s voiceover when she soulbinds to an ally, we can her talk about her betrayer briefly, warning her soulbound not to betray her. She says, \"...like  he  did.\" Therefore, Reina did not betray Kalista. In addition, Kalista was a renowned warrior, as said in her reveal. The story of the demon does not fit her. \\n Also, Senna is not Kalista. That doesn\\'t even make sense. Though some of you can argue that the name changed, Thresh doesn\\'t release the souls he catches and Kalista died from betrayal and being pierced by spears. Senna died from having Thresh rip her soul out with a chain. Not the same. Also, Senna wasn\\'t in any military as well as she wielded a light pistol or something. \\n In addition, JoJ is no longer true to the lore. \\n Good theory though', 'Question.

I like the concept but some of the abilities are kind of out there. \\n She has no damage but high utility. So support maybe? But, she also has a a damage ultimate. So maybe change that. \\n In addition, her passive is well thought out considering how quickly she may earn stacks but, die once and you instantly become Portals McUseless. \\n Thematically, epic abilities, but seems kind of restrained for an insane character.

You could place bounties and bets on people, kinda like in TwitchPlaysPokemon and SaltyBet with MUGEN. People could also be given currency from making fan art and stuff. \\n It wouldn't really take much effort either. It isn't like you need to do it in css either. People could keep track in their flairs if you allow flair text. \\n **\", \"I have been seeing far too many comments and threads (why doesn't Talon get X) about people saying that Riot hates Talon. Now I know that it has been stated by a Riot that they aren't fans of the gameplay design behind dashing (or in Talon's case, blinking) into single target in the way that Talon, Diana, and Akali share. This does not mean that these champions are condemned. \\n If they were, you wouldn't be able to play Talon AT ALL. Like he would essentially be iceboxed from nerfs. Riot really had to put a stop to Akali, so they did something like that to her, just not in such an extreme way as they did to Olaf (which was before my time, I joined at the beginning of S3.) Talon isn't terrible after his nerfs. He even was functional when he had his bug which Riot fixed in about a week or two from when I posted the video after a user (who unfortunately deleted his account so I may not credit him) made a post about it. That's actually pretty fast compared to some champions who have had long standing bugs that aren't fixed yet, granted some are easier than others to fix. \\n In addition, Talon has gotten a skin recently: SSW Talon. Now I know some of you probably disagree with that, as it was for a World Champion skin, which to some degree is a valid point. It is still a skin, and a pretty nice one at that. And if World Champion skins were not skins, Faker would've gotten Ahri like he wanted (Popstar Ahri was released, and they did not want to divide the sales.) People also say Talon has no fancy, expensive skin, which is true for many other champs. Some champs even barely see skins, even if their playrate justifies good sales. \\n All in all, I think some of us over react to this and are too quick to blame Riot. Like every organization, Riot is made up of people too. They have an immense amount of pressure on them as they have a large community to satisfy and no amount of monetary resources will make that burden lighter, just easier to carry. It costs a large amount of money to keep all these testers and software engineers staffed, and thus they may not be as many people devoted to fixing small issues like these as you think. Riot is trying to maintain a model of balance which separates it from other games like DotA 2 where the game design revolves around 'everyone is broken.' \\n So I guess what I am trying to say is... lighten up, its not as bad as you think it is.\"]": "Based on the postings, it appears that the user is interested in:\n1.

Here's my opinion as a relative old timer in the world of Ice and Fire fandom, having picked up the books in '02. \\n The books are, I feel, better, but books usually are when compared to TV or movie versions. That being said, the show is an INCREDIBLY faithful adaptation, and extremely well done. \\n What do I get out of watching the show, when I've read the books? Several things. First, new insights. As an example, remember the scene in season 1 when Littlefinger and Varys keep trying to top the other with the secrets that they know? Didn't happen in the book, for the simple reason that neither of those two is a POV character. But that scene was awesome, and absolutely in character for those two. Secondly, knowing what is coming makes many scenes in the show more powerful. The actors are great, which makes things very powerful. Watching Theon's struggles when he reached the Iron Islands were more powerful knowing what was coming; Littlefinger telling Ned he shouldn't trust him is the same. When a certain character you haven't met yet was mentioned offhandedly in a recent episode (readers can probably guess who I mean), I shuddered, and the scene was, I am sure, much darker for me than it was for you. \\n Finally, a practical consideration: It's no longer going to be the case that one season = one book. Book 3 is a monster, and is going to be covered in seasons 3 and 4. Books 4 and 5 cover the same time period, but deal with different characters; they're going to be mixed together for seasons 5 and 6, assuming (please) that the show continues that long. So after this season you won't be able to pace along in the same way.\", \"When I was young, my parents/grandparents used to take me to the local mall every few weeks. We'd see movies, they'd take me with them while they shopped, all completely mundane. In going to the mall, we never went past the mall turn-in, simply because no one ever had occasion to go that direction with me in the car. Again, completely mundane. \\n Right past the mall was the headquarters of a construction company called Fox Construction or something like that. They had a big sign with a picture of, unsurprisingly, a fox. \\n Now, having gone TO this point often but never PAST it, I concluded that this was because we weren't allowed to go past this sign. Why? Because this sign marked the boundary of the Land of the Foxes. I would see cars driving that way, and conclude that they were very brave or very stupid, and cars driving back the other way were very lucky to escape with their lives. \\n I never felt the need to mention my conclusion to any grown-ups; I assumed they knew, since they knew enough to never drive past the sign. This came up when my mom needed to get her drivers license renewed one day. So she buckled me into the car to go to the DMV with her, which was located (you guessed it) past the mall. \\n So I'm in the car, and all is well. We're driving towards the mall, and though I know we're going someplace that's not the mall, I'm not worried. I know where we are. \\n But then we come to the mall entrance, and rather than turning into the parking lot, Mom kept driving. Into the Land of the Foxes. \\n I couldn't have been more than four, but I clearly remember the rising feeling of horror as we passed the sign. I started panicking. I looked for a way out. Why would Mom do this? Doesn't she know the foxes are going to get us? There was only one conclusion: Mom was going to offer me as a sacrifice. \\n So I started screaming and thrashing, and begging Mom not to let the foxes eat me. Up until this point I had been sitting quietly, so Mom was more than a little startled and confused by my sudden terror.

The fact that the park could be running on auxiliary power with no indication of this until the auxiliary fuel tanks ran out is just really, really bad design. Especially when the system automatically shut off the electric fences to save power. The fences going down should have set off all sorts of alarms. It really broke the fourth wall for me. The park shouldn\u2019t need power to control the dinosaurs anyway. You know what happens to dangerous animals in zoos when the power goes out?  Absolutely nothing . Because their enclosures keep them contained via moats and walls. I know they had moats on the island, but they can\u2019t exactly do a great job of containing the dinosaurs if they can just smash down a fence to get out. \\n And then there\u2019s Ian Malcolm. That guy really just pissed me off. No one ever seems to realize that he\u2019s simultaneously asserting that A) the park is inherently unpredictable, while B) he\u2019s making predictions about it with absolute certainty. But ok, I\u2019ve dealt with enough academics that I can accept the arrogance as being not too remarkable in those circles, and I know enough about chaos theory to know that I really do not understand it. So maybe those assertions are not as oxymoronic as they look at first glance. \\n But that\u2019s not what really bothered me about Malcolm. It was when Crichton made him into his mouthpiece, and the utter garbage that spewed forth when that happened. Science has failed. The age of science is over. Science is inherently dangerous. Scientific knowledge is unearned. Science has done absolutely no good. Seriously, he goes on about how life was so much better when we were hunter-gatherers. I know that Crichton made his living writing books about the dangers of new technologies, but it\u2019s one thing to make us think about the consequences of scientific advances. It\u2019s another thing to be such a Luddite.', \"When I was little, I was taken to the mall regularly. Nothing unusual, but my mother would take me when she needed to do some shopping, my grandmother would take me to see movies, my dad would take me when he needed to go to Sears, etc. When driving to the mall, I never had the experience of going past the turn-in, simply because my parents never had reason to go that way when I was in the car. \\n Right past the mall was a construction company owned by a guy named Foxworth, including a sign with a big picture of a fox. So the four year old me, not being able to read, concluded that we never went past this point because, past that sign, was the Land of the Foxes. Humans weren't allowed there - I thought that the people I saw driving down there were really brave, and the ones coming back were very lucky. \\n I never told anyone about this, so no one ever told me I was silly. And then, one day, my mother had to get her drivers license renewed at the DMV, which was ... past the mall. \\n I get in the car quite content. We're heading towards the mall, it's all familiar, no worries. And then we get to the mall, and we keep driving. I distinctly remember the growing knot in my stomach as I realized that my mother was going into the Land of the Foxes. My mind raced. Why was Mom doing this? Was she going to kill me???? That must be it! She's going to give me to the foxes!!! What did I do?!?!?! WHY WOULD SHE DO THIS?!?!?!?!?!?! \\n At this point I began shrieking and thrashing. Mom is startled and confused, because I had been sitting quietly, and suddenly I'm crying and begging her not to let them eat me, what did I do wrong, I can be a good boy, I'm sorry mommy, please, please, I love you, don't feed me to them! \\n She pulled over, and it took her a good half hour (she said) to calm me down, and then another hour or so of talking to me to figure out what on earth I was scared of.

However, there was enough applicants that we're forming two groups. A second group needs just one more player, will meet at the same time as below, but on just Mondays or Wednesdays.[/edit] \\n I am getting a group together now for a game between the hours of 12:00-16:00 GMT+0, any day of the week every 1-2 weeks. (I'm actually on Pacific time, GMT-8, those early hours are just when I can game.) \\n So below you'll find a link to the calendar scheduling so you can let me know what days you can play. Once we have a group consensus on a day we will begin. \\n And if you are interested in joining, before we all sit down and begin play, lets get some basic stuff out of the way offline. I've created a basic survey that will help us to all narrow down the scope of what we will be doing. We definitely won't be starting off in a space tavern getting to know each other and hoping everything works out. Think about what kind of game you want to play. What does the group normally do, or what is the group supposed to be? Are you all thugs working for a local crime boss? Scientists on an exploratory expedition? Are you pirates hijacking whatever goods you can? Diplomats desperately holding together the empire? Imperial soldiers on the front lines of a faction war? The group\u2019s concept can help to set stage for adventure and intrigue. It can also inform other questions like: How did the characters first meet? What major events have the characters shared in the past? \\n Anyways, we'll figure all that out when we all sit down. For now I just want to get you thinking about it and to get some feed back so I can start preparing material. (Do I need to read up on naval battle rules? Do I need to be solid on galactic trade? etc.) \\n Also, please PM me your email address so I can add you to my contacts.\", 'Previously on \"Serpent\\'s Skull\"...\\nThe party is trapped inside a ziggurat, home of a rakasha that has the last one of 7 magical spheres we are collecting. Outside, we have gathered an army of Charau-ka and are preparing to wage war on the rest of the Mwangi Expanse. That army is protecting the 6 spheres we have recovered thus far. \\n The party is level 10 and consists of Kull - a gorilla alchemist that is appointed leader by our god Agnhazan. Myself, a charau-ka hexcrafter assassin. Boom, a goblin ninja gun slinger. Zaius, Charau-ka inquisitor that is also the king of the Charau-ka tribe/army we control. Rummy, high level human cleric NPC appointed by Agnhazan to protect Zaius (but he worships some other god and has some hidden agenda). And last, but not least, Rhowl the nature oracle. \\n Bharautum watched the group laugh and giggle as they shoved the shadow into the portable hole. Tired of all these noisy lemurs getting in his way, he decided to head off down the hall and see what there was and hopefully to get the jump on something and kill it before the group comes in and alerts everything. \\n Coming up to the first room, a pair of beheaded bull statues flanked the doorway. Probably some sort of warning to not be bullheaded or something stupid like that. He glanced over his shoulder and saw the group peering down the hallway at him. Better hurry up and have some fun before they get here. Stepping into the room, it was just a wreck - looked like some primitive library filled with clay tablets thrown about the room into heaps and piles. He poked around for just a moment before some of the others arrived and started sifting through the rubble with him. \\n Rhowlis blundering about the room when he finds something squishy - Pudding! That stupid ape walked right into it as he was kicking the tablets around. The goblin fires off several rounds at the thing, having some effect. Bharautum hasn\\'t ever seen a pudding before and all he remembers hearing about them is that these things hate fire, so he blasts at the thing with a scorching ray - OH YEAH IT BURNS! The thing catches fire and begins smoking. Everyone else in the room starts coughing and hacking. Idiots don\\'t know to hold their breaths! They all try backing out of the room as they hack and cough. Pussies. Bharatum rushes up to the thing, charging his fists with freezing cold energy - maybe the liquidy pudding will hurt from being frozen just as much as it hates burning. Smashing it felt good, but the thing was still alive and smoldering. Rhowlkicks hard at it and splatters it - chunks of the thing splash everywhere. \\n Searching through the room a bit more, I found several metallic plates, each with a relief image of a bull-like creature, much like the statues outside the doorway. I walked back into the hallway and turned to go into the next room with flanking, headless statues about the doorway. The big ape, Kull, had already searched through the place and was holding some potion trying to figure out what it was. \\n I thought Kull was a decent alchemist, but obviously that was a mistake. \"Give me that!\" I said, with an implied \"you idiot\" only slightly masked in my tone of voice. \\n \"What? Ask the right way!\" \\n Are you kidding me? This guy doesn\\'t know a thing, and he wants some sort of please-thank you? \"Give it to me!\" I replied. He refused again and we went back and forth a couple times before he realized who his better was. After a quick taste I realized it wasn\\'t anything important and gave it back. \\n They had also found some more metallic plates much like the ones I had found. We examined them and the statues but could not figure out what to do with them just yet. Giving up, I began walking down the hall to the next door when there was a sudden flare of light and the image of the rakasha appeared back down the hallway a bit. I immediately knew this was another waste of time for us, another programmed illusion that will just taunt us for getting trapped in his ziggaurat. I continued on my way to the next door, but everyone else couldn\\'t use their heads and were suddenly all up in arms about this illusion. While they spent their time trying to attack it, I reached the next door and tried opening it, but it was locked. \\n It was about then that the illusion started attacking back, dispelling some of the protections we had prepared earlier. Clearly this was a more powerful illusion than I had encountered before. Something like this would require the caster to be near by, perhaps in one of these locked rooms? \\n Kull got his wits about him and realized the same thing and bashed open a nearby door. Half of the party, including myself, went into the room and began searching it. There was a statue on the wall that was asking us some sort of riddle about \"Tell me about the North Wind\". It seemed reasonable that solving this puzzle would either get us closer to the rakasha or at least give us a clue about what was happening. The rakasha illusion took the time to dispell a few more of our protections while we did so. Then, to my surprise, it acted much more offensively and cast a fireball on the party searching through the room! \\n I avoided any real damage, but now I was sure that the rakasha had to be somewhere very close where he could see us. Our king realized this as well, and ran back down the hallway to the stairs we came down, searching for the real rakasha. After a short period he came back, having found nothing. \\n I remained in the room, determined to solve the puzzle - especially since the illusionary rakasha seemed highly interested in my search and even seemed to mock me as I mulled over the puzzle. The illusion eventually disappeared, leaving us to search the room. \\n The room was full of piles of broken tablets. Most were indecipherable from damage, but those that were still intact had various Aklo passages on them. I quickly was able to recognize the logic hidden behind their prose and came up with the answer to what was the North Wind. But when I gave it, the statue replied \"No.\"!!! Going back over what I had found, it became clear to me that the ancient peoples that created these tablets were hardly literate and were not educated into proper Aklo grammar. \\n I discussed the logic of the puzzle with the group and our great king was able to see through the puzzle and gave the right answer. \\n Another plate appeared. After deciding that there was nothing more of value in this room, we went back into the hallway. A couple others had taken time to explore two other rooms and found a plate as well, giving us 5 in total now. There was only one last door to explore. \\n We went into that last door, which had a short corridor and then opened up into another room that housed a portal similar to the one we had nearly been trapped by before. However, this portal had 5 small portals around it. We could see that they had small images of animals, different ones on each little portal. The animals matched the images on the plates we had found. I took one of my plates, climbed up onto the arch of the portal and put the plate into the portal with the matching animal. The portal dissipated, leaving just the stone wall behind it. We quickly did this with the remaining 4 portals, and the main portal flared to life. \\n I was more than just a little confused. Carefully, I questioned him and tried not to give anything away about who I really was - as long as he thought I was whoever he thought I was he seemed more than willing to be helpful. In fact, he claimed to be able to manufacture any magical item I desired. \\n Our discussion lasted for a good fifteen minutes, when finally the rest of the party came through the portal. They were supposed to follow me after just two minutes, so I realized that time flowed much quicker here in the magical laboratory. \\n The wizard offered to manufacture magical items for my friends too. After gathering up a list, he performed some calculations which took HOURS. His gnome helpers asked us for magic items to use as raw materials to begin the manufacturing process. We handed over lots of the various weapons and armor we had stored away. They started boiling and sawing away at them, drawing the magic out to be used on the new equipment. \\n And then the wizard told us it would take over 700 days to produce what we wanted. Clearly this was too long - our god has set us on a mission and we can\\'t spare that much time. We would have to leave now. We asked the wizard how to leave, and he said he couldn\\'t. After more questioning, we learned that he was a prisoner here and was bound in some way, but he would not tell us how to escape this place - but he knew how. He had been here for thousands of years and served the rakasha as well as many other masters in the past. He believed I was the rakasha and was just pretending to be someone else to fool him. \\n I began to tell the wizard that I really was not the rakasha, when Kull and Boom stepped up to either side of me and muttered under their breaths that they would not have me reveal who we really were - that if the wizard decided not to make our magic items that they would kill me! \\n What idiots! They would pay for that later... \\n We talked with the wizard more and got him to answer the question of how one gets out of this prison. \"Death is the only way\" he replied. \\n I wasn\\'t sure who\\'s death would be required - anyone? The wizard? A gnome? Our king pulled out a dagger and smashed it through the head of one of the gnomes. \"Is that good enough?\" he said. The wizard shook his head. \\n So, someone else would have to die then? Why not Kull or Boom for threatening me?! \\n I immediately jumped at Kull, intent on taking the advantage of surprise to kill him outright. As I turned, a stray paper slipped under my foot. I began to stumble, attracting the attention of Kull. He casually turned to look at me, and I fell against him like a fool. Luckily no one recognized my intent and thought I just had a moment of clumsiness. \\n We dismissed the wizard and let him return to his work making our items. I quietly told my king that I would be happy to slay the wizard when he was distracted. The king agreed that this was a good plan and said he would support me should the wizard have a chance to retaliate. \\n I casually approached the wizard. I watched him as if I were an apprentice watching a master at work. Then I struck out at him, fully prepared to kill him in that moment. Just as I lurched forward to attack, the wizard had brought up some flask of liquid to examine it in the light. That gave him just enough peripheral vision to realize I was bearing down on him and he reacted, avoiding my blow. \\n (Attack against Kull: Natural 1. Attack against wizard: Natural 2. This whole assassin thing isn\\'t working out so well for me.)', 'The ease of Dungeon World character creation inspired me to create a similar process for creating D&D 5e characters. [This]( is my first class - The Fighter. Very soon I will be making similar sheets for the other classes. \\n I will be running a game with several players that have never played D&D, so my goal with this character sheet was to limit the number of options and guide them through the character creation process. This character sheet is intended only for level 1 fighters. Once the player reaches level 2, time would be taken to fill out a new character sheet with all the details of the full game. \\n House rules were heavily applied when making this character sheet, so it won\\'t work for everyone. Some of these rules are: \\n Ammo: On the sheet you\\'ll notice that ammo is listed as \"2 ammo\" or \"3 ammo\". We ignore counting individual arrows and instead, when the player attacks and hits, but just barely within 3 points or less of the target\\'s AC, then the player has to choose between doing 1d6 less damage or reduce ammo by 1. \\n Adventuring Gear: When a player finds themselves in need of rope, pitons, torches, a 10 foot pole, or any other random thing, then instead of tracking what they have exactly, we simply say that they happened to have planned for that hand have that equipment on hand. When we do this, we reduce the Adventuring Gear by 1 use.', 'Sorry, things in life aren\\'t as black and white as you want them to be. Dogs have an extremely wide range of possible behaviors from attacking anything that moves to lazily never flinching when poked and prodded endlessly by annoying children. Being an animal doesn\\'t mean they will inevitably resort to instinct. \\n Dogs don\\'t just act on instinct, which is exactly why they are \"man\\'s best friend\". Dogs have a long behavioral juvenile period that allows them to learn many behaviors and adapt to life with humans. This period is part of what makes them different from wolves and other canine species and enables them to act in ways that would not agree with what would otherwise be instinctual. Dogs learn a great many behaviors and concentrate the majority of those in socializing with humans. None of these are instinct, they are learned. \\n And I disagree that what wouldn\\'t be bad for an adult would kill a toddler. Sure, you\\'d be a dumb parent for letting your toddler keep playing with the dog after it started to get annoyed, but you kid isn\\'t going to die or be maimed - if you know your dog to never be aggressive. If you know your dog to be \"iffy\" or never tested, then caution like your warrant is the right way to go. \\n I myself would keep let my dog sniff and be touched by the toddler while I keep a hand on the dog while observing how the two interact. As they play I\\'d let the dog have more freedom of movement and would correct and teach the dog what is appropriate. Through such exercises you\\'ll learn what the typical play of the two is like and how to manage it  and what you can safely allow. I\\'m sure the play of the toddler and dog in the video evolved through a similar process since the kid was so eager about playing with the dog. I\\'m sure the parents cautiously allowed the two to play like in the video, but more supervised. As they grew comfortable with the play the were able to sit back, watch, and enjoy.', \"My experience with DW and what I find listening to actual play podcasts is that DW isn't so much a game about mighty and heroic characters, but more about a bunch of fuck ups that just barely manage to swing a sword or cast a spell without hurting themselves or getting themselves into an even worse situation. \\n I think that this can easily be changed by simply adding +1 or +2 whenever you roll. This would greatly change the odds and make it possible to complete a scene without fearing every single roll. \\n Normally there is an 85% chance of something bad happening when you roll - that is a 40% chance of outright failure and a 45% chance that what you wanted to do would be successful, just with some complications. At +1 the overall risk drops to 75%. At +2 the risk drops to 60%. Add in the normal +1 or +2 you'd get during play and you suddenly are practically unstoppable.\"]": "1.

Only a young chef or a shitty chef will mix their salt and pepper together. There is no control this way and it ensures all dishes will get pepper. Some chefs will have the sense to have the pepper and salt in separate dishes, but add the same amount of salt and pepper to each dish; this denotes a chef who hasn't learned to properly season things yet and does not have a good palate. Yet other chefs understand that you must season things different, but still add pepper to all things; these are the most puzzling of chefs and are destined to never be at the top of their game.

His wife stopped him from coming over and they angrily stormed off. I don't know if any one saw this besides me. As soon as I could no longer see them again I began to breath again and immediately started crying. I tried between sobs to explain why I was so upset.

Meaning going to Turkey/Syria while roaming about with surveillance equipment. That activity is generally frowned upon if the government doesn't know you're there. Him and his colleagues got stopped by I think the Syrian (since I believe Turkey was aware he was around) army due to suspicion of espionage. \\n The dude seems to be one of the most absent minded professors. But apparently he got himself out of being detained by Syrians, so, yeah, hamsters.\", 'That\\'s like a lot of the cases they gave us in middle school/high school. It gets problematic because of the locker part. The locker is part of school property and, in some places (I have no idea what has changed in the past decade), that means the school can search it without your permission. If it were on your person, usually the school couldn\\'t search you without some bullshit like \"possible suspicion\" (as opposed to probable cause). \\n In any case, I would highly recommend never leaving anything illegal in your locker. In college, I lived in an awesome dorm, but that didn\\'t mean other people couldn\\'t enter it without my permission... like fire inspectors and building maintenance. And I always made sure any suspect paraphernalia was completely hidden. Even though I was 21 and legally an adult for everything except, like, rental companies, I had to hide my shit. Man, even when I rented my apartment the following year, I hid any suspect shit because my landlord could be showing the property whenever. Don\\'t take chances.', \"I am one of those people... sorta. This is a long read, and I'm writing it partially for myself because I've been thinking about it recently. \\n I have always been pretty sensitive to greasy/oily food. In high school, I would have a slice of pizza for lunch every day and feel kinda off. Eat a small bag of fries and get a bit of a stomachache. Now, none of this was so bad that I couldn't eat them, and I loved me some fries with a chocolate milk shake after school when I was younger. But I got tired of feeling a bit off so I fiddled with my diet. \\n I cut out soda my senior year of high school and replaced it with water (actually that was mostly a doctor's order due to slight kidney issues, but it took a while to really cut the Mountain Dew habit). This, with exercise, did more for my physical and mental health than I can explain. I don't care if it was psychosomatic or what, it made me so much happier. \\n For the past couple months, I've been eating yogurt with m\u00fcsli/granola, along with a bit of salami and some tea. I eat salads a lot, no dressing (my parents never put dressing on my salad when I was a kid and I just got used to it, I suppose). I eat a lot of tofu... but when I do at home, I fry it in bacon grease because  holy shit . And yeah, I sometimes have a kale/pineapple/other fruit smoothie, and you know what? It's fucking delicious, as long as you make sure the kale is in tiny pieces. \\n Look. I grew up with two obese parents. During college, I lived in a town that has a lot of local food available in stores and restaurants. I was a baker for a bit. Food was already near the front of my mind. And I saw what people ate, and I heard them tell me how they felt, and I paid attention to my own diet and how I felt. And I discovered that however much I like bacon, eggs, and toast for breakfast, I feel better throughout the morning if I have yogurt and granola. However motherfuckingdelicious the beer battered catfish is, I will be in a world of tummy ache and general ugh for the evening and won't be able to see my friends, so I should get the very delicious beet and goat cheese salad. \\n The way I see it, I'm maximizing my pleasure by cutting out the stuff that makes me feel gross for a long time, even if it makes me happy for a short time, and replacing it with stuff that makes me feel happy in the long run, and as a bonus makes me pretty happy at the moment too. People have been telling me I look better and seem healthier. I haven't been getting more exercise, I've been eating better. \\n When I want chocolate, I eat a square of really good chocolate. This, to me, is more satisfying than eating a lot of any kind of chocolate. When I want a hamburger, I make myself a hamburger with good meat. The time I spend cooking and tasting and discovering makes each meal that much more satisfying. I don't care what you eat. I sometimes am a bit jealous of people who can eat a greasy sub and feel fine. But just because I like healthy food doesn't mean I'm denying myself food I like, or tasty food, or any of that. I really, truly, deeply prefer food that happens to healthy. \\n And I see nothing wrong with having a big breakfast burrito on the weekend, when I can spend the day in a semi food-coma. I'm too restless to be bogged down by big, heavy meals most of the time. \\n Anyway, I haven't had breakfast yet, so this might not be the most coherent piece I've ever written.\", 'Sorry for the length. I\\'m not great at being concise. Just go to /r/hpmor and check it out.) \\n So, I was never a huge fan of \"sci-fi\" until I realized how large of a genre it is. I never read Dune, and honestly, I think it\\'s one of those books that is really for young adults but can be read by adults. You need a book that is written for an adult. (Dune fans: everyone I know read it as a kid. They still love it, but if it is usually read the first time as a kid, it\\'s for young adults). \\n \\n His Dark Materials trilogy by Philip Pullman. It\\'s written for young adults, so maybe it isn\\'t for you, but the story revolves around the idea of parallel universes, the concept of free will, what religion is, and what God is. Note that they made the first into a movie and the Catholic Church pretty much had an aneurysm because it is very, very anti-corruption in religion. I mean, they wage a war against god (without being like r/atheism) and the main antagonist is the Church. It isn\\'t about \"this is so cool!\" It\\'s a very emotional coming of age story for two children who essentially don\\'t have parents, or rather their parents are very complicated and mostly absent. The first book, Northern Lights, is a bit easy and definitely a kid\\'s book, the Subtle Knife gets a bit more tense, and the last, the Amber Spyglass, delves into the concept of consciousness and the soul. \\n \\n TV shows like Doctor Who, Torchwood (which is a doctor who spinoff aimed at adults instead of all ages), Star Trek (I\\'m partial to Next Generation). Original Star Trek? Let\\'s shoot some aliens and sleep with the hot ones! Next Generation? What does it mean to be human, can machines feel emotion, what power does language have, how can extremely different cultures live together, how do you interact with cultures that are not as advanced. And they have families, they\\'re not just running around a space playground. However much I love Firefly, I can totally see your point on that. \\n \\n This wouldn\\'t be complete without a plug for Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality. You don\\'t need to have read the series to read this. It\\'s what Harry Potter might have done had he been raised by scientific intellectuals and thus applied science to learning magic. It is amazing, the people at /r/hpmor are fantastic and probably could give you other fantasy/scifi recommendations. The science in it is all real, and some of it honestly goes over my head at times. The best fantasy story for people who don\\'t like the hand-waving-woo aspect of magic.', 'Talk to your boyfriend. \\n \\n Are you sure that the sexy time chore thing isn\\'t, well, a problem between the two of you? Sometimes sex with a lady feels like a chore because I\\'m just not that compatible with her. Sex with guys usually felt like chore even when we were compatible (minus the fact that they were a guy, that is). (This doesn\\'t mean you might not be bi or a lesbian, but it\\'s an important point to think about.) \\n \\n Don\\'t worry about labeling yourself right now. I used the Kinsey scale during college, saying I was about a 1 on experience and probably a 4 in feeling. I didn\\'t really like calling myself bi because I had so much more experience with guys than ladies. Now I don\\'t really use the Kinsey scale because it doesn\\'t take gender spectrum into account, but I liked that I didn\\'t have to \"figure out\" which label was most appropriate. You know what\\'s way more fun than ruminating about whether you\\'re a lesbian or bi or queer? Having sex with a hot lady. \\n \\n I don\\'t get the last bit, about telling a straight girl you like her. Is there someone in particular you\\'re interested in? Or are you asking generally how you start hitting on ladies? \\n \\n Girl crushes are completely normal for a lot of women who identify as straight. I look at guys and sometimes think they\\'re attractive, but I have no interest in sleeping with them.', 'Alright, I\\'ll go for it. It\\'s a touchy subject for many people (as you can see) but people getting into linguistics seem to quite often ask pretty strong questions. It\\'s language, people have opinions about it, and I figure it\\'s only a real problem if you\\'re taking it seriously after linguistic studies. \\n Annnnnnnnnyway. \\n I always used to think Hebrew sounded so harsh. I went to Hebrew school when I was a kid, and even though one of the Israeli teachers was so nice and soft and gentle, her Hebrew still sounded harsh to me. Still does for me to a small degree, but I think all the ling stuff I\\'ve done has mostly removed that kind of opinion/judgement/ what have you. \\n I never, however, found German to be harsh. It always bugged me when people were/are like \"lol german is so harsh rght guyz?!\" Because yeah, if you listen to German while as spoken by Hitler at rallies, it\\'s gunna sound harsh. If you talk to someone your own age over a beer, not so much. \\n Also: French. I took French, my dad speaks French, I\\'ve been to France, and I still hate the sound of French.

Not spoken, not women, not European or South American as far as I can tell, I don\\'t know, something gets me. Yet I love the music.  shrug \\n Whew. Okay. So. This is the kind of question I\\'d hear (and probably did hear) at a linguistics party in the first year or so. It\\'s one of those \"huh, language is really cool and so vast and nearly every single person who ever lived has had at least some experience with this\" questions. Which are great, but can and have and do devolve into terrible judgements by people about other people. Because if you\\'re looking to alienate a group of people, it\\'s really handy if they speak a different language or dialect than you that you can designate as \"inferior\" ( cough  African American Vernacular Language).

Can't get one?  A small sponge in a plastic bag with holes poked in it will suffice in a pinch.  As your guitar's wood gains and loses moisture in the changing seasons/humidity, it will expand and contract, and eventually can split along the grain like your guitar. \\n There are different ways of repairing this, but this is what I do and have found good success with this method. I use CA (cyanoacrylate, super glue. NOTE: DO NOT USE CA GLUE ON GUITARS FINISHED WITH NITRO CELLULOSE) to fix the crack.  If you want to make the crack visually disappear, I've found that filling the crack with Basswood dust before gluing helps to make the glue line look like the rest of the spruce. \\n It looks like one side of the crack is lower than the other; when doing the repair you will want to push up the low side from within the guitar.  Glue along the crack until it won't suck the glue down into the crack anymore.  CA glue sets quickly, but I still use a glue accelerator to cure it even faster.  Keep holding the low side from inside the guitar while the glue sets. \\n Once the glue has set, you may want to put a cleat or two beneath the crack inside the guitar.  You can just use a small piece of popsicle stick about an inch long, glue it across the crack.  Normally I will not use cleats if the crack is behind the bridge, as adding extra bracing can affect sound, but in this spot it shouldn't affect anything. \\n After everything is glued up you'll have a nice big line of glue on the top.  I use a broken section of a bastard file about two inches long, with tape around both ends so I don't scratch the top in places I don't want to.  Use the file to bring the glue line down as close to flush with the top as possible.  From here you'll want to start with 400 or 600 grit sandpaper, wetsanding with water (I like to add a drop of dish-soap to my spray bottle).  Once you've got it nice and smooth and there aren't any more lumps, sand up in gradually finer grits.  You can hand buff to a nice glossy finish, but if you have access to a hand-held buffer that will make things easier.\", \"Oh, brother man, are you in for a treat. \\n Start with In A Silent Way, then work chronologically through releases from there to see/hear how it all evolved over the course of six years ('69-'75). My personal favorites are the Complete In A Silent Way Sessions (excellent choice for LSD sessions), Sides 3 and 4 from Bitches Brew (also good for psychedelic exploration), Jack Johnson (great music for tripping to), Sides 3 and 4 or Pangaea (Gondwana, music to melt away to), Get Up With It (FREAK THE FUCK OUT to this one), and the Isle of Wight 1970 set (will make you high just from listening).\", \"It's aimed at audiophile vinyl collectors, like myself, who may already have a 40 year old copy that is a little worse for the wear, so the prospect of a brand new copy is enticing. The thing about these 180 gram remasters that are all the rage right now, is that some are good, and some are just lousy. The latest vinyl remasters of Roxy, Uncle Meat, Overnite Sensation, and Freak Out have been PHENOMENAL. \\n The lacquers for these new vinyl releases are being made directly from the master tapes that Frank OK'd, and being cut by Chris Bellman, who is one of the very finest vinyl mastering engineers in the business.

Nice quality card-stock outer jackets with very high quality album art and original inserts, a la the Freak Map.

Philip busted a pipe open that came directly from the toilet. This pipe had apparently been obstructed by a large piece of foam or something, stopping up lots of toilet paper and shit.  Shit .

Sheikh Yerbouti is definitely a great album, mostly taken from live concerts in '77 (especially Hammersmith Odeon in London, which has been released in full on cd), but with lots of studio overdubs.  Adrien Belew plays really well on this album, and his singing in City of Tiny Lites and his Bob Dylan shpiel during Flakes is classic.  He went on to play with the Talking Heads, David Bowie, and King Crimson.  Oh and listen closely to Patrick O'Hearn's bass playing. \\n Just be aware, that since you're just getting into Zappa, you may be turned off by some of the juvenile humor as this is one of his more immature joke (still funny though) albums.

The most important part is the http vs  (it defines how the data is sent), but the rest defines where it is sent. \\n So you have something called a Top Level Domain (TLD) which is the .com, .org, .net, .ca, .us, etc.  This tells the browser who the site\\'s name is registered with.

This has a very nice side effect -- it makes your IP harder to track, thus allowing you for more anonymity on the web when you want it. You could call this an extension of Google\\'s \"Incognito mode\". We call this service the \"Hola VPN\". This is a VPN service similar to many such services that exist on the Internet, but is very easy to set up (one click) and is free and ad-free. It is useful for seeing how a web site looks like from a certain geography, for more secure browsing, for overcoming government censorship (e.g. seeing Facebook from a country that blocks it), for overcoming your corporation\\'s Internet site blocking, for seeing a site in its native language (e.g. seeing the Spanish news site as it appears to Spanish users), and more. \\n Note: I am a software developer and am going to explain some of the things I see in a semi-technical manner. \\n They don\\'t explicitly say  exactly  how their service works, outside of using nodes.  What are these nodes?  If I use their service, does my computer become a node?  These questions are not answered, anywhere on their site (and I just spent an hour scouring it). \\n It\\'s pretty rare to purposely post false information as a business (which is what Hola is).  It\\'s very common to obscure  how that service works , but it is very concerning to me.  I take it to mean that I wouldn\\'t like how their service operates, so they aren\\'t going to tell me. \\n Side note (and completely unrelated): I don\\'t really see obscuring an IP address as an extension of privacy modes found in browser (like Google Chrome\\'s \"Incognito mode\" mentioned).  They are fundamentally doing different things.  Privacy modes delete cookies, browsing history, and other stored information when the browser window is closed.  This means that after the fact, there is no way to use the browser to prove what sites have been visited while browsing in privacy mode.  Hola makes it look like the machine is browsing from a completely different machine altogether.  This is useful in obscuring locations and/or getting around censorship.  They are just attaching buzz-words to things consumers might already be familiar with (which isn\\'t a crime, just misleading), for completely different tasks.', \"I'm gonna start this off by saying that I am currently in a really bad mood.

However, I\\'ve read a lot of comments here suggesting uses for stones, so here we go. I had been reading elsewhere that Moldavite is an awesome rock known for its profound ability to accelerate one\\'s personal and spiritual evolution. Today, I bought a tiny piece, about the size of a dime (it\\'s expensive, yo!) at the local place with stones. When I first held it, I got a strong vibe from it, but nothing too amazing. (I\\'ve been kind of off today & am still kinda new to all this stuff.) However, I had brought my boyfriend, who\\'s a lot more sensitive to stones with me. I handed it to him without telling him what it was & it made him uncomfortable & he was like, \"Man this is weird, what is that (feeling/vibe)??? Is that algae?\" Then, I told him it was a Tektite & he started talking about \"space eels\" coming from it & he didn\\'t want to be around it at all. He doesn\\'t trust it because it\\'s not from Earth. :/  Has anybody else experienced/ worked with this stone? How did it affect you? Any suggestions for how to use it?', 'Yes, a literal \"fairy\" (in his mind). In my opinion, \"she\\'s\" either a demon of some kind or something he created from too much past shroom usage. He\\'s an occultist. \\n I\\'m depressed as hell. It\\'s been over 2 weeks & I\\'m still completely useless. I\\'ve got so many things I should be doing to restart my life, but I\\'m just so fucking depressed. \\n It\\'s completely irrational. He was insane & problematic, & not because of the \"fairy\". He would \"curse\" random strangers that pissed him off somehow. He was socially awkward. He couldn\\'t have a serious discussion without losing it & literally screaming & snarling. He doesn\\'t own a car or have a license by choice, which is abnormal for the city he lives in. He rarely washed his clothes & the last time he did, I had to bribe him with Taco Bell to get him to come to my apartment to wash them for free. He had no friends left & bad relationships with his family. My therapist told me he sounded like he had the emotional intelligence of a 13 year old boy. (My ex & I are both 31, btw.) \\n He also treated me like shit. He would cook for himself while I was over & suggest I make peanut butter toast if I was hungry. He spent all his time I was around on his computer or doing magic-related stuff while I waited for the occasional 1-minute \"cuddle break.\" \\n Then, about 3 months ago, he bragged about his fairy-fucking online (how I found out about it) & when I asked him about it, he told me it had been going on for several months & he was more in love with the fairy than he was with me. He had sex with her at least every other day. He said I should be okay with it. I was crushed. He said if I had a problem with it, I should \"FUCK OFF AND DIE.\" I was confused because he said fidelity was something that was supposed to be limited to earth/ this realm. (He completely came up with that himself.) So, I went to reddit, on here & asked what other \"occultists\" thought about what he was doing. I submitted lots of interesting threads starting with [this]( The only people who thought it was okay were self-described polyamorists. That\\'s it. And even they said he\\'d cheated by hiding it from me. I was really confused. When I tried talking with him about my findings & that I was hurt, he just lost it every time. This went on for somewhere between 2 or 3 months. \\n About 2 weeks ago, I had put up a thread on /r/shamanism because he had recently decided to enlighten me that \"she\\'s\" his supposed spirit-guide. So, I wanted to ask if it was normal to fuck your spirit guide when your in a relationship. Well, he saw my post, & even though he had previously told me it was okay to post stuff about it online, he said he wasn\\'t okay with it anymore. He \"no longer liked me as a person\" & didn\\'t want to be around me anymore. Iow, he broke up with me so he could fuck his fairy in peace. \\n Why am I upset?? He behaved like a crazy person & treated me like crap. But he could be sweet. He was extremely loving when we would cuddle & be intimate. There was chemistry there that I\\'d never had with anyone before & don\\'t know if I ever will again. It was just as painful as it was pleasant in the end though. When he said, \"I love you,\" all I heard was, \"I love you, but I love her more.\" And that shit hurt. When I was away from him, I\\'d think about him, the way people do when they\\'re in love. But, when he was away from me, he was fucking his fairy. That shit hurt. \\n So, why am I still broken now?? Shouldn\\'t I be relieved?? Shouldn\\'t I be glad I don\\'t have to deal with his insanity every day??\\nThis is irrational!

He has a few Gods and several \"familiars\". One of them is a woman with green skin, a tree fairy, whom he\\'s recently informed me is his spirit-guide. \\n A couple of months ago, I found out he\\'s been having sex with his green \"sexy, sexy tree fairy\" spirit almost the whole time we\\'ve been dating (about 6 months). I only found out about it bc of something I ran into that he posted on reddit. (I know his name & we frequent the same subs. He didn\\'t think I\\'d notice it.) \\n He said he didn\\'t tell me about his sexual astral relations because he wouldn\\'t ever admit it to anyone unless it was anonymously. He says he did a spell for her that made her free so no one could bind her. But she will be around forever, as his spirit-guide. She also heals him, among other things, but according to him, since she will be around, he will have to be screwing her because he\\'s in love with her.  He admits to being more in love with her than me.  They used to have sex about every other day before I found out about it. He claims they do it less frequently now because my finding out about it has made it a little awkward. \\n I\\'ve read online about how nothing between two humans compares to what happens when one is intimate with a spirit. What I\\'ve read stated that sex between spirits is often a form of tantric sex that creates a soul-bond that enhances & permeates the connection between the two spirits. I\\'ve also read that shamans have been known to have sex with their spirit guides in the past, along with witches with their familiars. \\n Now I\\'m frustrated because I don\\'t know how to feel. This is unlike any situation I\\'ve ever been in.  Is it rational to be jealous of someone\\'s relationship with a being from another dimension?  He left his wife for being unfaithful to him, but that was with a human person. He says infidelity only counts between those in the flesh, on the same plane. \\n I\\'ve tried talking with him about it (him & the fairy) & how it relates to/affects our relationship several times. However, 4 out of 5 times it ends with him throwing a tantrum, screaming about how he\\'s a free-spirit, how I don\\'t own him & that what he does with his spirit, mind, or imagination is his business alone. \\n When I\\'ve asked him to tell me how it\\'s not cheating, he\\'s said: \"1) It\\'s a dream 2) Because the only way to properly understand is to experience this yourself.\" Then he said, \"Well, Mud Girl [that\\'s what he calls me when he\\'s extra angry] i\\'m not entirely sure where these places are but that\\'s the common answer that we give to ignorant shits. but if it will finally shut you up, sure. that\\'s about as close to an explanation as I have been able to get.\"  Yes, I\\'m aware that the way that he speaks to me sometimes is incredibly degrading. That\\'s not what I\\'d like to focus on though, if y\\'all wouldn\\'t mind. \\n I was wondering if, from anyone\\'s experience here, they might have any insight or suggestions as to what I might do, or suggest a different perspective to look at this situation from. \\n If at all possible, I want to find a way to be okay with it.

We had had the usual brief sex earlier that evening, but I was getting the longing/ache again. We had also talked about his spirit \"companion\", so it was very intense. I tried asking for sex & he said no. I was upset because I knew I was going to have to deal with it the entire weekend away from him. Jo could tell I was upset & he got very, very angry, because he was already very stressed about something else. He called me a monster who wanted to use him as a human dildo. I just wanted to talk about what was happening, but he said it stressed him out too much. Then, I left & he broke up with me VIA TEXT MESSAGE. Jo said he wanted me to  stay away from him. He\\'s a fairly accomplished witch, & not at all a sympathetic/empathetic person. He was only ever interested in what was going on in my life if there was magic he could practice to  try fixing it. Jo\\'s only likely concern towards me now is to keep me away, regardless of his claims to have loved me before.  He has a tendency to push people away like that. It\\'s possible he\\'s going to do spells to \"block\" me to encourage my staying away from him, which he does to people he doesn\\'t like.

Jo could tell I was upset & he got very, very angry, because he was already very stressed about something else. He called me a monster who wanted to use him as a human dildo.

He\\'s a fairly accomplished witch, & not at all a sympathetic/empathetic person. He was only ever interested in what was going on in my life if there was magic he could practice to  try fixing it. Jo\\'s only likely concern towards me now is to keep me away, regardless of his claims to have loved me before.  He has a tendency to push people away like that. It\\'s possible he\\'s going to do spells to \"block\" me to encourage my staying away from him, which he does to people he doesn\\'t like. So, I don\\'t expect him to be any help towards my situation/undoing the spell. The situation is further complicated by the fact that I know zero magic. I was sort of his apprentice, & was only supposed to be practicing meditation & studying/reading.\\nHow do I get rid of my feelings for him when I\\'ve been under a spell? Will it just fade with time like after a usual breakup? How do I get rid of the recurring deep longing/aching feeling in  my lower stomach, where my second/sacral chakra would be?', 'I was dating a witch for about 7 months. (We\\'ll call him Jo.) He told me shortly after we started seeing each other that he had \"summoned\" me with a love spell. It wasn\\'t specifically aimed at me by him, but the kind that mentions certain qualities, etc., & lets the fates/whatever pick the person. After Jo told me, I looked-up ways to tell if one was under one/the symptoms, & I recognized some of the signs in my experience. \\nIt was a very intense relationship at the beginning. Jo was delighted by how our bodies fit together perfectly. My sexuality was awakened in a way that I\\'d never felt before. I also went off pharmaceutical anti-depressants around the same time, which had been curbing my libido, switching to natural meds. Something notable is that, a bit later, Jo showed me the spell, & it said for her to \"long for his bed each night.\" He said he hadn\\'t meant it in a sexual context, but rather to just mean that she was to want to be around him, at his place in the evenings.\\nHowever, I\\'ve had an issue with a deep longing/aching feeling in  my lower stomach, where my second/sacral chakra would be, when I think about him/am around him. It\\'s unlike anything I\\'ve felt before. At first, it didn\\'t happen all the time, but often enough to be a little bothersome. The only thing that made it go away was to have sex with him. This wasn\\'t too much of an issue at first because there was enough passion in the relationship to satisfy me.  However, a few months in, he started getting less interested in sex than I was. Jo rarely initiated it, he would only last a few minutes & he wasn\\'t as \"present\" or enthusiastic as before. He would say, \"You know we don\\'t have to have sex all the time.\" & \"I\\'m not a  dildo.\" However, I still had the same longing/ache. This was causing friction in the relationship. Then, about a month ago, I found out that he had started having regular, about ever-other-day astral sexual relations with, & had fallen in love with, a being from another realm, several months previous, around the same time he had started behaving differently towards me. I wrote about that here:  He said that it did not affect the relationship between him & me & that \"\\'she\\' really, really liked\" me. I tried to accept/deal with this new information. I even brought it up with my therapist, who said Jo sounded self-absorbed & emotionally immature. However, the longing/aching ended up getting more frequent/intense & unpleasant, especially when I would think about him with \"her.\" It was almost unbearable at times. I tried to convince myself we wouldn\\'t work out, but I was just so in love with him. \\nThe relationship between Jo & I ended last night. We had had the usual brief sex earlier that evening, but I was getting the longing/ache again. We had also talked about his spirit \"companion\", so it was very intense.

How do I get rid of the recurring deep longing/aching feeling in  my lower stomach, where my second/sacral chakra would be?', 'When I didn\\'t find a post out here on this subject right away, I thought: \" WTF, dudes/ladies? How has astral sex not been brought up here yet???\" Then, after doing some research, I found out why. It\\'s because it\\'s complicated as hell. :P You\\'re combining 3 subjects alone that are complicated enough by themselves: 1) Astral Projection  2) Sex/Relationships & 3)Personal Morals/Values. ~No wonder it\\'s hard to find anything on this. \\n So, I\\'ve been trying to figure out my opinion on this topic for quite a while. It\\'s hard for me because I\\'ve never experienced astral sex. I\\'ve never even astrally traveled.  However, my SO has astral sex with one particular spirit (from another realm-further complicating things) on a regular basis. He says he\\'s in love with her.  It\\'s been on my mind since I\\'ve found out about it & trying to talk with him about it hasn\\'t exactly gone over well. (Except, maybe once.) Hence, here I am. \\n Searching the internet, I\\'ve come across a couple of different opinions, but there\\'s really not that much out there on the topic. :/ Here\\'s what I did find: \\n First, there\\'s the \"What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas! :D It\\'s actually great for everyone! ;-)\" sort of philosophy. The following quotes kinda sum-up what appeared to be one blogger\\'s educated opinion: \\n>\"Since this person is in spirit and you are in the physical, there should be no guilt even though you may be presently in a relationship. In fact, your astral lover will encourage you to form physical relationships and may even guide you to the right person. The astral lover will do all in her/his power to help you have a happy, fulfilling life in all ways.\" \"Loving on the astral is not a betrayal of your physical mate or\\ncompanion. If anything, it will enhance your physical love-making.\" \\n Found that here: \\n Then, on the other hand, there\\'s kind of the opposite opinion, that the astral\\\\spirit sex has the potential to down-play or hurt relationships on the physical plane. I ran into this kind of idea a couple of times on reddit. One person said, \\n> \"Its [spirit sex is] beyond awesome but I think I made too good of friends with this spirit because anytime I get a real girlfriend I don\\'t find them interesting sexually compared to the spirits. Once I break-up with the woman the spirits have seem to come back full-force... the feeling from the divine is hard to get from another human.\" \\n Then, another said,\\n> \"The spirit spoils you, with that perfect sensed reflection of untrammeled, sweet deep fiery love, the love of the divine that penetrates deeper than doubting, hesitant material love seems able to. It redefines the concept in a way that makes it incongruent with how \\'real\\' physical love develops. I\\'ve lost the two lovers I even tried to take to childish dissatisfaction and disappointment, and now I just think it\\'s kinder to be the waiting widow or widower than to make someone earnest feel like s/he\\'s not good enough in the face of such a rival. In the end at best they only think you\\'re off your head, and maybe that\\'s best. It\\'s a confusing way to go.\" \\n You can go to the sub-reddit these came from here: \\n And that\\'s all I got. :/  To say that I\\'m left confused at this point is a bit of an understatement.  Questions that have been bothering me are: \\n \\n Is astral/spirit sex with another being while in a monogamous relationship on this plane morally correct? Or is it cheating? \\n \\n Is astral/spirit sex with others bad for one\\'s relationship with their SO? Or, could it actually be beneficial, as suggested by one person\\'s opinion above? \\n \\n Does/should monogamy only apply to the realm one\\'s SO resides in? \\n \\n \\n I\\'m very torn & confused on this topic. It\\'s been eating at me, badly. My boyfriend thinks I\\'ve become a bit obsessed with it, & perhaps that\\'s true. To me, fidelity, honesty, & loyalty are integral to relationships. Not knowing if these things are being honored in mine is going to continue bothering me until I can figure this out.  I just want to be able to let it go , but in order to do that, I have to know what it is that I\\'m coming to terms with... if that makes since. :/ \\n Any opinions/ comments/ answers to the questions above are greatly appreciated! :)']": "Based on the user's reddit posting history, it can be inferred that the user is primarily interested in topics related to spirituality, crystals, rocks, and stones.

Here's my take on it. \\n You are right to say Gaston is the protagonist. The story isn't about Belle falling in love with the beast, it's about Belle driving Gaston, the greatest man in the town, into despair, madness, and death. Gaston's plight is comparable to that of Okonkwo in Chinua Achebe's  Things Fall Apart : a man of tremendous worth who has raised himself from nothing to become a pillar of his community, torn down by circumstances beyond his control. \\n I interpret the 60-eggs-a-day line with nearly as much significance as you. It proves that Gaston must be extremely wealthy. Paired with his prowess in hunting, he is beyond a doubt an unparalleled provider. \\n Gaston sees that Belle, though presently happy, is in need of a great deal of help in the long run. She doesn't seem to have any profession, and her only source of support is crazy old Maurice, whose work cannot be counted on as a consistent source of money, and who is getting old as it is and clearly can't be providing for her forever. Gaston only means to extend an offer to her that he knows will be extremely beneficial to her. Also, I think it is pretty well implied that his love for her is real, because he has completely at his disposal every other girl in the town. However, he is, as you say, not adequately able to express his emotions, and the fact that the whole town (except Belle) worships him hasn't helped him to develop social skills. \\n When Belle turns him down, he is confused and distressed not only because no-one says no to Gaston, but also because he sees that by turning him down Belle is essentially throwing her life away. When Maurice dies, what's to keep her from starving on the streets? Belle thinks she's doing what's best for herself, but Gaston knows he has to show her that she is mistaken. This is part of the value of having Maurice taken to the asylum--if Belle were to not give in to Gaston's demands, sooner or later she'd realize that she's hopeless on her own. \\n Then, on top of all of this, she falls in love with an actual monster? The beast is violent and inhospitable and childish--it's Gaston but worse! Belle won't accept the best breadwinner in her village but she will accept a literal animal. With an offense like that, how could we expect Gaston to remain stable? How would Gaston be expected to believe that the beast is kind and gentle as Belle claims? Seeing as he's an almost legendary hunter and since the beast had essentially wronged him, what could Gaston do but try to remove this threat, even knowing that his life could be on the line?\", \"I can't believe you didn't mention the part where they went to the sewers.

You consider if your opponent has a counterspell, if he doesn't have another threat in his hand you need mana open for, etc. But once Aetherling is on the field, most of the time the die has been cast already. You'll win if you timed it right, and you'll loose if you played him too soon. His abilities generally allow him to ignore every permenant on the field, so long as you have mana open. \\n PLA is the opposite. He has flash and can't be countered, so you don't have to decide in advance whether the time is right, you'll just play him whenever you can. Even if they have the doom blade you can just bounce him and loose a bit of tempo. The biggest decisions related to PLA come when he's in play. You have to interact with your opponent's creatures. You can choose whether or not to bluff an instant for prowess.\", 'This info took me way,  way  too long to find an answer to, so for the benefit of the community I thought I\\'d post what I found here. I researched all of this while building a multiclass Paladin/Warlock character for the Adventure League; I wanted to make sure that no matter how pedantic my DM was, my character was legal. Also, RAW=Rules as Written, RAI=Rules and intended. Enjoy. \\n ---Part 1: Spell Components--- \\n >\"A spell\u2019s components are the physical requirements you must meet in order to cast it. Each spell\u2019s description indicates whether it requires verbal (V), somatic (S), or material (M) components. If you can\u2019t provide one or more of a spell\u2019s components, you are unable to cast the spell.\" \\n Verbal  spells require you to speak magic words aloud. \"A character who is gagged or in an area of silence, such as one created by the silence spell, can\u2019t cast a spell with a verbal component.\" This is the easy requirement that pretty much everybody intuitively understands, and it has no special exceptions that I know of. So V components will be ignored from here on. \\n Somatic  spells require you to perform various magic hand gestures. These spells require one free hand,  with some exceptions . The War Caster feat is one; it grants characters three abilities, one of which is to \"perform the somatic components of spells even when you have weapons or a shield in one or both hands.\" (phb pg170). There are other exceptions to this rule too, detailed below. \\n Material  spells require you to have specific objects in your hand to cast them,  once again with exceptions . These objects can be reused repeatedly for any spell that requires it (ex, the mirror used to cast Sanctuary), unless the spell explicitly states that it consumes the object (ex, the 1000g diamond used to cast Resurrection). \\n>\"A spellcaster must have a hand free to access these components, but it can be the same hand that he or she uses to perform somatic components.\"(phb. 203) - This is an important rule, which I will call  the Material Exception . \\n ---Part 2: Foci and Component Pouches--- \\n Foci and Component Pouches are  identical  mechanically: they both replace the material component requirements of your spells, as long as that material doesn\\'t have a gp cost indicated.  This is their only funciton . So, to continue the earlier example, you can use your spellcasting focus/component pouch as a replacement for the tiny mirror required to cast Sanctuary, but you could  not  use either as a replacement for the 1000g diamond required to cast Resurrection. \\n Any class can use a Component Pouch, however many classes nonetheless specify different Foci specific to their class. \\n \\n Bard - a musical instrument \\n Cleric - a holy symbol \\n Druid - a druidic focus \\n Eldritch Knight Fighter - None, must use Component Pouch \\n 4 Elements Monk - Specifically exempt from the Material Requirements of its spells \\n Shadow Monk - Also specially exempt,  except  for the Minor Illusion Cantrip which requires \"a bit of fleece\"  \\n Paladin - a holy symbol \\n Ranger - None, must use Component Pouch \\n Arcane Trickster Rogue - None, must use Component Pouch \\n Sorcerer - Arcane Focus \\n Warlock - Arcane Focus \\n Wizard - Arcane Focus \\n \\n ---The Holy Symbol Exception--- \\n Mechanically speaking,  a Component Pouch is strictly better than  (almost)  any focus , since any class can use a CP. This is why they cost so much more gp than spellcasting foci. The one exception to this is  the holy symbol . Unlike other foci, which are all objects, your holy symbol can just literally be a symbol, an Emblem visibly engraved or inlaid onto your clothing, armor, or shield (phb 151). This, in combination with the material exception, means that  Divine casters, while holding a shield engraved with the symbol of their god, can cast Cleric/Paladin spells with both Somatic and Material Requirements.  Your other hand is free to hold a weapon or anything else. If you\\'re multiclassing, keep in mind that this exception  only  works with casting cleric/paladin spells. You\\'ll need to keep another focus/component pouch on hand to meet the Material requirements of Warlock spells, for example. Likewise, non-Divine spells with Somatic requirements are still going to require one free hand. \\n To get even more pedantic,  the holy symbol exception  only  works on divine spells with M components and M+S components, it  does not  allow you to cast cleric/paladin spells that only have a Somatic component.  The reason for this is that the material exception no longer applies, so you can no longer use your shield hand on the magic gestures. So while a Paladin can cast Aid (V,S,M) with a sword and shield in hand, he must free one hand to cast Cure Wounds (V,S).  Here\\'s a link to Jeremy Crawford, the 5th Edition Rules manager, explaining this on the official Wizards website. \\n ---Part 3: Weapon Switching--- \\n From phb, pg190:\\n>\"Your turn can include a variety of flourishes that require neither your action nor your move...  You can also interact with one object or feature of the environment for free, during either your move or your action . For example, you could open a door during your move as you stride toward a foe, or you could draw your weapon as part of the same action you use to attack.  If you want to interact with a second object, you need to use your action .\" \\n There\\'s also a long list of examples of these interactions, including \"drawing  OR  sheathing a sword\". Not both. Between these rules and the text of the War Caster Feat (\"You can perform the somatic components of spells even when you have weapons or a shield in one or both hands\"), it\\'s pretty clear that RAI you\\'re not supposed to be able to sheathe your sword, cast a spell, and then draw your weapon again. \\n That being said, it\\'s still possible to do RAW. Crawford has stated that [dropping your weapon is not part of any type of action.]( Meaning that it\\'s perfectly legal to drop whatever you\\'re holding in one hand, cast a spell with a Somatic requirement, and then pick it back up again. Keep in mind that this is not enough for non-Cleric/Paladin Material spells, since you\\'d need to pull out your focus/component pouch as well. \\n \\n Conclusion: \\n Though I was never able to find a source, I\\'ve been told that Crawford and Mearls have both said that 5e was designed in the hope of avoiding this kind of pedantic nonsense. Given that, I\\'d say  DMs should probably ignore most of the bullshit above and just let players cast their goddamned spells.  I don\\'t see what having all these rules for the Somatic and (non-GP costing) Material requirements add to the game, particularly when so many weird overlapping exceptions exist for both. The most exploitive thing players can gain from  the above information is the ability make attacks of opportunity with weapons after casting their spells. But if your DM really, really wants to play RAW, I hope you find the above info helpful.', 'An important detail to remember is that the introduction of firearms does not \"trump\" benders or override all the utilities of bending. Benders are just as capable of wielding firearms, and their abilities provide a tangible advantage over non-bender firearm wielders. Firearms merely raise the average offensive threat level of all persons, bender or no, considerably. This has happened once before in the avatar world though, with the introduction of the shock gloves/ tanks in S1 of the Legend of Korra. That whole season is essentially a mini version of the discussion we\\'re having now. \\n So, what are the relevant differences between guns and shock weaponry/ steam powered mechs? The most relevant difference appears to be  effective ranged combat  and  faster than human reaction time projectiles . A glove, baton, or metal rope is only useful at close range and are much, much slower than bullets. All of the above can reasonably be dodged by a trained human, and benders could attack effectively from a greater distance than any of those weapons. Bullets cannot be dodged and out range even benders. These qualities, in my mind, make guns better offensive weapons on average than bending. This was NOT the case is LoK S1. \\n It follows then that the differences between the nations will be determined by the distinct advantages each type of bending grant that are  not  overriden by firearms. Earth/metal benders gain mobile cover in virtually all terrain, which is HUGE. This seems to make them the new military power. Water benders seem like generally inferior earth benders outside of the artic, with the exception of blood benders that are of course crazy OP. Fire benders loose almost all offensive utility, but retain value as human power sources. Without air benders to oppose them, firebending powered planes, bombs, and blimps rule the skies. The fire nation becomes (remains?) the Mecca of industrial progress. The maneuverability of air benders make them much harder to target, but too few of them exist to make a difference on a national scale.', 'My thread was removed, so per Mod request I\\'m reposting this here. \\n Before moving into my own thoughts, I\\'m going to start off by assuming general familiarity with the controversy and summarizing current pro and con arguments for the tuck rule. I\\'m only including a small subset of the arguments I see as legitimate, and this admittedly excludes some of the justifications given by the rules committee itself. If you wish to debate the validity of the arguments presented or omitted in this summary we can debate them in the half-dozen other active threads on this topic. Feel free to skip this if you\\'ve been reading every comment thread. \\n \\n --PRO-- \\n \\n EDH is a format designed around having consistent access to your commander. Playing a format built on that premise and then having consistent access denied to you is unfun and antithetical to the goals of the format. \\n \\n The tuck mechanic was a loophole that became accepted as common practice when Wizards began printing cards designed with the loophole in mind (Spell Crumple, Chaos Warp, Derevi). It created undesirable rules complications. \\n \\n \\n --CON-- \\n \\n Tuck was the only semi-permanent answer to many powerful and/or difficult to interact with generals. Those generals become format warping without the presence of tuck effects. Banning those generals means banning them from the game entirely since the \"Banned as a Commander\" list no longer exists. It is undesirable and/or unnecessary to add numerous new cards to the banned list just to remove the tuck mechanic, and If the rules committee does not ban problem generals, the format will become untenable. \\n \\n Tucking promoted interaction with the commander mechanic, and in its absence games will become repetitive/boring/undesirable since no removal spell can be considered more than a tempo loss. \\n \\n \\n \\n Given these arguments, I think an underlying problem is at work here. And I think it\\'s rooted in the very core of our format. \\n Everyone agrees that EDH is defined in part by having special access to the commander, which PRO both arguments are leaning on. Further, I take it for granted that nobody would be in favor of a rule that removed the commander tax for the sake of promoting general access. This would undeniably lead to the kind of boring repetition CON players seem to be worried about. The debate is not over either of these tenents, the debate is over the proper balance between them. However, in order for CON #1 to be valid, an implicit assumption must be present and I believe that it has yet to be broadly voiced. Namely: \\n The Commander Tax is not effective enough at deterring access to one\\'s commander \\n This is argument I\\'m here to defend. \\n Part of the appeal of EDH is the format\\'s ability to make countless cards uniquely viable. This viability to due to the format\\'s ability to support very mana inefficient cards, which in turn is due to two things: its multiplayer nature (because players can team up to take down the player who is ahead AND because the games last much longer) and possessing 40 starting life w/ the commander damage rule (which neuters aggro strategies not based exclusively on the commander). When every player is playing mana inefficient cards and never has to worry about being aggro\\'d out of the game, this makes strategies centered around high mana costs and card draw powerful. The power/mana cost ratio of cards is not linear. There\\'s a big jump from 1cmc to 2cmc for example, and the jumps get farther and farther forward in power once you pass 6-7 mana. This is why here and only here you get to play Clone Legion and Insurrection. The fact that we have plenty of time, mana, and life to spend on card draw is what allows strategies based on synergy and engines to thrive despite this being a singleton format. \\n When players recognize this nonlinearity in power/mana ratios, this makes ramp extremely powerful. Players start devoting resources in the early game to the late game, since the big cards become the only things strong enough to take on 3 other players. This, too, is seen as a positive feature of the format to many. Sol Ring is legal in this format. The justification for the existence of fast, big mana of this type is (as i understand it) that getting a mana advantage is not as big of deal when getting in 1st place paints a big target on your head. But, of course, this doesn\\'t keep players from running Sol ring. Nobody here would deny the power of EDH ramp. \\n So, now that I\\'ve established that big mana strategies are not just popular but are actively incentivized by the rules of the game, I\\'d like to return to the Commander Tax. The goal of the tax is to reduce access to the commander on a non-permanent basis; a compromise between deck consistency and player interaction that we\\'re currently debating in light of the removal of tucking. Nobody wants the extremes on either end, where generals are either unstoppable or never given the opportunity to shine. \\n So, given the goals of the Commander Tax, I think it\\'s nonsensical to claim that adding +2cmc to the cost of a card significantly reduces its power or access in an EDH environment. Every deck is incentivized to have ramp which nullifies the increased mana cost, and card draw which allows players to access that ramp. It\\'s a hurdle that doesn\\'t require careful deckbuilding to cross; every competent deck already possesses the means to quickly overcome it turn after turn. Part of what makes EDH unique is the format\\'s ability to mitigate mana inefficiency, so trying to punish players by making their key strategy mana inefficient will necessarily produce only a mitigated punishment. \\n \\n If tucking remains banned, the punishment for having your general removed needs to be greater. If the goal of the commander tax is to delay, but not prevent, access to the commander, then why not make that delay an explicit part of the rules? I suggest, and am fully open to discussion about, a new house rule in light of the tuck ban that replaces the commander tax entirely. \\n The \"Recovery Counter\" Rule \\n \"Whenever you Commander is placed in the Command Zone, put a recovery counter on it for each time it has been cast this game. At the beginning of your end step during non-extra turns, remove a recovery counter. A Commander may only be cast from the Command Zone when it has no recovery counters on it.\" \\n This rule mandates the kind of delayed access the Command Tax was intended to provide. The End step was chosen over Upkeep for the same reason the non-extra turn clause exists: to keep blue from being able to circumnavigate the system (in this case, with Paradox Haze). There are other interesting implications of this rule (timing of removal matters, flash matters, etc), but this post is long enough so I\\'ll leave that for comment discussion.', 'I beat  Fire Emblem: Awakening . \\n As a longtime fan, I can confidently say that this is the most polished entry the franchise has ever produced, and is  the only FE game I\\'d recommend to everyone . The 3 difficulty levels and the ability to turn off perma-death give the game far more appeal to casual players who don\\'t want to restart the same level over and over again to keep all your units alive. For long time fans, you\\'ll be happy to know that Awakening synthesizes positive elements from every modern FE game and improves on all of them. It has: \\n \\n The overworld map from Sacred Stones, but without the infinite grinding that made SS easy on higher difficulties. \\n \\n The branching class options from SS, personalizing unit development. \\n \\n Weapon Forges from Path of Radiance/Radiant Dawn, but with total improvement caps that turn forging into a strategic decision (should this sword be stronger or have a higher hit chance?) instead of just a question of \"how much money can I put into this weapon?\" \\n \\n The Skill system from PoR/RD, but with over twice the number of options and a flexible, simplified equip method. Acquire skills as you level, pick five, switch them out before battle. No more points and pie charts. \\n \\n \\n On top of that, every new mechanic is spot on. \\n \\n A customizable, playable avatar unit is equally appealing to new and old FE players; it gently instills a sense of personal involvement in the former who may be turned off by what they interpret at first glance to be a \"standard fantasy plot\", and gives the latter a feature they\\'ve dreamed about for years. \\n \\n The ability to foster relationships between units to the point of marriage and (recruitable!) children adds tremendous replay value and even more narrative depth to a series that\\'s capitalized on its stellar localization and writing for years. \\n \\n Replacing the Rescue command (which allows one unit to save another at the cost of stat penalties) with \"Pairing Up\" (combining two units into one super unit) was a choice I\\'ll admit I was dubious of at first. The former existed to penalize moving units without thinking, the latter appears to promote the same activity by creating invulnerable hulks. However, by limiting the stat boosts gained and by only allowing units to pair \"behind\" one another, the lead unit is still placed in considerable danger. In essence, they\\'ve removed the ability to rescue things entirely, prompting even more thoughtful choices. (I could talk about this mechanic for hours, it\\'s implemented so well on so many levels and there\\'s so much more I haven\\'t touched.) \\n \\n A mix of weekly paid and free(!) DLC, on a handheld title. We all know why DLC is good and why DLC is bad, so I won\\'t reiterate that for you here. The paid packages will run you 6-7$ for 3 maps, 3 characters, and some new skills, weapons, and items. None of it is required to enjoy the game, though one of the packs can be faulted for being essentially \"infinite EXP, infinite money, and infinite super weapons\". You have to work of all 3 (you have to work  hard  for the third), but that\\'s still what that particular pack boils down to. Additionally, while it\\'s cool to be able to use characters from old FE games (the vast majority of these are free), the lack of support conversations and voice acting makes them lackluster in comparison to the main cast. However, because the main experience suffers in no way from the existence of this DLC, the game can\\'t be faulted for extra content. If you don\\'t want it, don\\'t buy it. \\n \\n \\n The only big fault in the game I could point to, in comparison to other localized FE titles, is a comparatively weak story. I\\'d place it as the second worst, above Shadow Dragon. The difficulties come from having to deal with so many variables. Your avatar and all of the dozen or so child characters could have completely different qualities and relationships based on player choices. This conflicts with what I\\'ve already mentioned as one of FE\\'s greatest strengths, character development. The only game I\\'ve ever played that\\'s managed to pull off a wide, branching array of character choices while simultaneously keeping an epic narrative is Mass Effect (accomplished via intricate world building). In particular, most of the \"big choices\" you run into during the story feel forced and unsubstantial. \\n Beyond that single flaw, Fire Emblem has never been this good. If you own a 3DS, buy this game immediately.', 'I\\'m glad I could be of help. In addition, I\\'d like to give you a word of advice that I\\'ve found most former Yu-Gi-Oh players need when transitioning to Magic. \\n By and large, synergies in MtG are nowhere near as obvious as they are in YGO. Though tribal cards like I mentioned above do exist, they\\'re the minority not the majority. When deckbuilding, it\\'s up to you to figure out for yourself how your deck is going to win; the decks usually won\\'t build themselves. \\n Take a look at [this.]( The left side of the page lists the most commonly seen cards in Arcanis EDH decks. As you can see, the #1 most used card is [Counterspell.]( The question you should take a second and ask yourself is  why ? It\\'s such a simple effect and it doesn\\'t do a great deal in the long run, so why is it so popular? \\n First, think about Arcanis. His purpose is to draw you tons and tons of cards. 3 per turn. When making an Arcanis deck, you\\'ve got to think about the best way to turn drawing a bunch of cards into winning the game. Second, think about counterspell. It\\'s essentially a 1 for 1; you loose one card and an opponent looses one card. It slows the game down by keeping the board locked up. The reason both are played together is because Arcanis gives you far, far more cards than your opponent. A 1 for 1 becomes great; your opponent will run out of cards long before you do. Additionally, countering your opponent\\'s removal spells will keep Arcanis alive to net you more cards in the future! The opponent will run out of steam and you\\'ll keep going.

The important thing to remember is that most advisors (nevermind individuals) don't beat the market and on average perform worse  especially after fees are considered . I don't really consider this to be an option that should be chosen in general except for those with very weak education  and  no interest in developing the basics. Since you're here asking questions I doubt you are one of these people. \\n Recommendation - C): I would recommend you self-manage your investments with market-index tracking Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). These are basically mutual funds that trade on a stock exchange with typically  really low  MERs. Spend time picking a few (say an international blue chip ETF, a S&P/TSX ETF, and a Global Bond ETF), rebalance, save more and you will do just fine. This is a simplied example but the point is you will have a diversified portfolio with very low management fees. Many brokers will let you trade at least a few ETFs for free too. \\n Me personally? I self-manage and actively invest in individual companies but this is what I am trained to do and like doing. I realize that based on the averages I will likely not beat a balanced diversified portfolio over the long-term but I enjoy it.\", \"Banks are fair weather friends, meaning they love lending money to you when things are going well for them and for you. \\n When things are not going well for whatever reason they are just willing to lend  relatively more  money to individuals/companies with good credit ratings/etc than those than don't.

If you're truly getting married any way there is  no reason  to put yourself in such a risky position of losing your money if things go sour. \\n2) Ignoring the $100K, you should be applying for the mortgage together regardless of whether your credit is worse or not. By applying together the bank will base the loan on her credit score AND her income + your income. This means potentially a better rate and/or more money. If you two intend to be together this is the best choice. \\n If you insist on buying a house before you are married you SHOULD NOT give her the money. Instead, you should jointly buy the home and document the fact that you are putting in $100K up front.

You also pay $2,500 a month all in for mortgage payment, condo fees, etc. Assuming the house increases by 3% a year  including inflation  in 25 years you will have a $1.05 million dollar 25-year old condo and no mortgage.  \\n Scenario 2 \u2013 You rent the condo for $1,500 and invest your down payment of $100,000 and that extra $1,000 a month for 25 years (300 months). Assuming a 7% annual return including inflation on your investment you would have a $1.4 million dollar portfolio but no 25 year old condo.  \\n \\n This is a simple example and I would have to write a long detailed multiple-scenario analysis to flesh out different scenarios and assumptions.  In my housing market is cheaper to rent than to buy right now.  As a side note I also value flexibility. I can sell my entire portfolio in 5 minutes for less than $50 in commissions. I cannot do that with a condo. \\n BUT, the\", 'One thing that is often ignored about the rent vs buy discussion is that  every market is different and continually changes . \\n For example, where I live I recently found several apartments available to rent in the $1,500/month range including utilities. If I bought a condo of similar size in the exact same area the mortgage payment would be $1,900/month at minimum ( assuming I put 20% down), nevermind maintenance, condo fees, utilities, etc, which adds up to a total monthly outlay in excess of $2,500. \\n Instead of buying I believe that,  in the current market environement specific to my community , it makes more sense to rent and then invest that extra $1,000/month. In other markets it might actually be better, stricly financially, to own than to rent depending on local supply and demand.  You have to check and run the numbers!

It's a nice piece of writing, and it's fluent and immersive, but I think there's certain elements of it which are very situational, and if it's OK to show me a little more - the beginning of the actual plot - it might help to give you a more concrete critique, because at the moment I'm just guessing as to the intentions of the story. \\n My first question is, basically, how long the story is going to be. In general, with a  short  short story, I'd go in both feet first, which means any exposition should be kept to a minimum. Writing a 2K word story recently which did have a lot of background to get across, I started the dialogue/action going and fed in most of the context when the characters were getting to the point where the reader needed that perspective. Without much context as to the later thrust of the story, I'm assuming however that you need to give me information about the city watch. I'd just watch the character's perspective getting too lavish in description of the world around her while not yet putting her directly into the situation that forms the backbone of the story. \\n >The new city watch\u2019s so-called justice was as brutal as it was corrupt. Loved ones would disappear at night, only to be found face first in the filth filled gutter, with bruised bodies and open throats. Those who went to the new government with tales of abuse and molestation were turned away, their pleas idly disregarded below flamboyant feasts and other hollow luxuries. Fear hung in the air like a stagnant mist, stifling and inescapable. \\n This basically sounds as if you're setting up a mystery.  However , in a short comic book story I wrote, I was told that exposition like this (the protag of the story was narrating it in the past tense, which is why I generally gave up on comics and went into prose) dampened the emotional impact of seeing such an incident (my cousin studied screenwriting at UCLA, so he was a good person to go for for critique on drama; comic books are basically frozen TV episodes :D). If this is a fundamental point of the story, show us it, don't tell us. \\n In fact, although it was a chilling, Soviet-style dictatorship style disappearance rather than brutalised bodies appearing on the street, this is almost idential a passage my cousin told me broke impact later on when we saw an example of such punishment. It would be more shocking to us if you showed something like this happening - but as it's a short story, what you tell us also has to revolve around what the vignette is about. So while this might set the scene nicely for a longer novel in which such action was peripheral, for a short story, it potentially punctures tensions I assume you're going to explore. If you're just using this as atmos and the story is about something totally different, then it might be relevant, but I'd go for something more directly relevant to what situation you are setting up and resolving. (China Mieville uses such an idea of a violent state leaving warnings to its citizens on the street in  Perdido Street Station  without it being a particular plot point, but his novel was huge and could comfortably go into world-building detail without detracting from the focus of the story.)\", \"Tricky one. I don't think it's either/or. I've done this a few times with various stories - not so much worldbuilding details, more with the way the story pans out. Since I'm a gardener rather than an architect, I usually start the story with a premise and a scene and not much else. While I was writing my last novella, I had a brainwave halfway through about the status of one of the protagonists that really shook things up. I actually didn't stop writing, because I still had the basics of the story down and the plot didn't change. I just went back and tweaked bits and pieces at the beginning of the book to give some hints to what was going to be revealed later on, some before I finished the book and some afterwards, when I'd worked on another story with a similar character in it and knew the general mechanics of how that variety of supernatural character worked. \\n So maybe see what you can salvage from the first part of the story. Does it change the fundamental premise of the scenes you've already written, or does it require you to scrap what you've got? I'm also part way through a book where I had a few doubts about what had happened to awaken the monster threatening a ship, plus I've worked out that there's an internal political issue surrounding the protagonist that needs some trailing. I've kept as much as possible of what I already had, and rewritten some parts of it to reflect the altered mechanics. When I rewrite, I find that the structure of the book doesn't change an awful lot - it's the content that does change. So therefore there's an incentive to keep the skeleton and change the flesh. \\n This can happen at any time, but usually with me it's how the story develops later on that changes things at the beginning, and I additionally find it helpful to revise what I've already got, quite often in order to regain momentum after taking a break (which I do regularly to keep myself from burning out on a particular work). During re-reads, I continually tweak and add and subtract; I've tried just loading the book onto Kindle to avoid that, but ended up making loads of notes in the text and thought I'd be better just to read it in Scrivener so I could make the tweaks I wanted to make at the time and have done with it. I wouldn't presume to tell you how you work best, because everyone finds their own way of working which suits them. \\n Does that help?\", \"I must admit I didn't enjoy the last time I tried to do a Camp NaNoWriMo challenge in July 2014, because I got to the 'so near, yet so far' point - within 10% of the total - and then couldn't look at what I'd written as a result of having personal issues take over in the final few days and letting things slide completely. So this year I'm doing something in the spirit of NaNoWriMo, but without the numbers game that was actually detrimental to my enjoyment of writing (and let's face it if it's not enjoyable, there's no point in doing it). \\n Basically, I'm trying to do a scene a day on a rewrite of the MS from last year. No pressure, no word count, it's a revision so I'm editing as well as pouring out words - I am working on structure and composition as well as sheer volume. I had a few issues earlier in the autumn which prevented me from finishing the project I've been working on for most of the year, but once my head was in a better place, I've bounced back. I know I don't do well with numbers, but because the issue with the first draft of this book was the structure and plotting, my goal at the end of November is to have a viable project, maybe not finished but with the back broken and a general idea of how all the plot points tie together. I've already figured out some of the elements that were plaguing the original draft. I did start on 23 October, and I'm 10K words in, but as I said, the point is not word count, the point is moulding the story into much better shape than it was in previously.\", \"I'm sorry that you have had bad experiences. I have had to put up with my mother being a cuddly, beautiful woman in her own moderately-sized body yet making a song and dance over my figure. She harps on about how I lost weight when I was studying in Poland because I ate proper food, when in reality she was out there with me for a week and got the wrong impression. I try to tell her that I don't think it was my diet but probably the amount of running around town I did to and from the English lessons I was giving out there, but she doesn't listen. She is constantly worried about her weight but she's an ideal size and works out. \\n To be honest, I think most of the stories on this excellent sub are not about fat people in general but the rudeness and the ridiculous logic that these people are throwing at other people who  are  trying to look after themselves and other people have been conned into thinking that being fat and eating crap is healthy for them and then proceed to be rude to others about it. \\n I should eat better. I'm a bit chunkier than I would like, and my hips have ballooned in the last couple of years (compared to all the skirts and trousers I bought a few years ago I've definitely grown outwards). I don't watch my actual weight (potential for some sort of obsessive-compulsive issue, as I have Asperger's and need to watch situations where I could become fixated on something), but I do watch my clothing. I need to cut back a bit and eat healthier - but it's not because of looks or what other people think of me, I just think I would look better a bit slimmer. \\n It was while I was back at uni and passing the Polish delicatessen that was the problem. All those pierogi and sour cream. Plus weight no longer  drops off me like it did five or six years ago - I'm at the beginning of middle-age spread and so I need to police my diet a bit better, particularly since as a student/office worker I'm not going to get the exercise I need working. For instance, my boyfriend and I have started replacing chips with stir-fry veg and I try to get skinny milk in coffee when possible.\", \"I think what people contribute to the sub reflects each individual and their own process better than trying to establish 'best practice'. There are a lot of people here who game, and a lot of people who write - reasons for world-building which, while not directly antagonistic, are different enough that there's no one-size-fits-all tutorial which could help. For instance, as a writer of fiction, I like bottom-up worldbuilding that can change to fit the story. I don't fix anything until I need to publish something. I like to take a premise and a character, and then grow their society around them, which helped me come up with a kind of Victorian Westeros, albeit with much more pronounced urban fantasy supernatural elements. Other people do conventional mediaeval fantasy, some people do high tech space opera, yet others do post-apocalyptic or alternate history versions of our world, and a lot of people here do write intricate story bibles or wikis to make sure they know their song before they start singing; I'm more of an open-mike, improv night person. \\n We all bring different things to the table. Tropes to me reflect what's in the world, rather than being guidelines to work to. ('Tropes are not bad', but they are cliches, and so if someone told me that the way to write a convincing religion was to adopt the tropes of established authors, I'd point out that a lot of modern SF&F is sceptical of faith, and tends to reduce it to a set of inquisitions, petty squabbling gods and corrupt established churches, which as a practising, liberal person of faith I'm keen on  challenging , rather than parroting.) They don't pigeonhole; they create a taxonomy for analysing media, but suggesting they are the be-all and end-all of human (or otherwise) society is probably a restriction too far. \\n If you have ideas for a set of tutorials for beginners, though, shoot. I've written up a tutorial for producing artistic city maps on another forum, and might copy it over here (because I can't link directly to a members-only section of another site). There's a bank holiday coming up in the UK :), and it might be wet.\", \"Oh yes (addressing the OP here). Register is really important. While you don't want people to speak like they come out of Chaucer or Shakespeare or any deep period piece depending on the historical period you're emulating in your work (for accessibility if nothing else), you also don't want them to speak like 21st century westerners. \\n I've experimented with more archaic dialogue in order to create character and atmosphere. I'm writing steampunk fantasy, so I can imitate the speech patterns of the Victorian world without writing totally in that 'dialect'. Like with most things, however, it's getting a balance. Think a little bit more about how to steer a course between total period immersion and just plonking down modern vocabulary in a historically-inspired setting. Period language can be silly to modern ears: I had to suppress a few giggles while reading the memoirs of Titanic survivors, because no-one uses the words they're using seriously any more, yet that was genuinely how people spoke and wrote a hundred years ago, and these were people who fought the sea and won, so they deserved a little bit more of my serious attention than your average Colonel Blimp. Likewise, Lord of the Rings is written in a very archaic style and, despite it being reasonably accessible for a reader, it's not something that I'd advise someone to  copy  nowadays, particularly when Tolkien still uses the word 'queer' for odd and some other words which we've changed the meanings of since then. I write with a modern tone, but use some more archaic words for flavour: 'youths' for 'teenagers', for instance, or 'to be in want of something' for 'needing something'...but only as flavour. \\n Maybe try a few good modern translations of older books to get the cadences right (for instance  The Three Musketeers ; a tip is that the free or cheap versions on Amazon are usually reprints of older editions, so you want to look for a recent translation, which may be as expensive as a newly-written book, unfortunately; try Penguin Classics or Oxford University Press editions - they tend to be the most up-to-date versions). I read Emile Zola when I was at school and there was an essay in one of my books explaining how the translator worked to conjure up atmosphere that would be more relatable to a modern audience than translating the archaic French ultra-faithfully without using too much modern slang. Zola's work dealt with working-class politics (and is full of sex and violence, no-holds-barred for its day; it's like Dickens but  better  IMO), so I'd recommend him to any writer of gritty fiction anyway. For your purposes, Zola deals quite explicitly with 'onscreen' death; one of his characters  dissolves  from disease.\"]": "Based on the user's postings, it is difficult to determine their specific area of interest.

Must be for not recommending vanguard. The reason why ETFs are cheaper than funds is that often funds have higher management fees along with front loading fees and withdrawal fees. Lots of fees can absolutely ruin your returns long term. In regards to your time horizon, it really matters in terms of the liquidity of products that you are buying in to. There are hedge funds (I'm not saying do this...) that have lock up periods of 5+ years and specific redemption dates where if you don't say you want your cash, tough shit. There is the option of purchasing individual bonds, but if there is thin liquidity, there is no way you will be able to sell, or if you can, the bid/ask spread is so high you would cry yourself to sleep at night. Same goes for some very small cap stocks. Also, I'm regards to stocks, if your time horizon is any decent amount of time, often times the index is a very good and safe choice. But if it's super short term (days/months/etc) and you're looking for a quick gain, the index isn't the place for you. Also it matters in terms of the mix of asset classes. Are you looking for something like capital preservation and minimal volatility? If that is the case, maybe you want to have a larger proportion of your portfolio in bonds and less in stocks (quick rule is 100-your age = percentage in stocks).

Every year, on average, money loses it's value by 3.35%. $0.97 in 2012 is equal to $1 in 2013. This is why you remember being able to buy a candy bar at the corner store for $0.50 when you were growing up. A little bit of inflation is a great thing because it encourages a lot of investment because you obviously want to retain the value of your money so you put it in a bank account that's pays a little interest or you invest it elsewhere instead of shoving it under your mattress. Too much inflation too fast, however, can cause problems as you can imagine. What if you woke up one day and a loaf of bread that cost $1 the day before and $1000 today (this actually happened in Zimbabwe. It's called hyperinflation)?! \\n Deflation is the opposite effect where money gains it's value. This happens when the government buys back currency or markets decide it's worth more. In this case, that $0.97 in 2012 would be equal to $0.95 in 2013! This can, like inflation, be good or bad. Too much too fast causes problems as well.

You can negotiate this to a lower standard deviation to get a better deal. \\n Your current position lacks diversification. There is no real way to avoid taxes, only minimisation strategies.

Asking someone for their credentials is asking at what institute they study, or what stage of education they are at. \\n 4) I am in the middle of preparing a presentation for a group of philosophers (It's about 'metametaphysics and why I think it is a waste of time).

That is, you are free if you are  free from  something, like obstructive and discriminatory laws, then you are free. Period. This is why they find notions such as positive discrimination so confusing and antithetical to the 'feminism as equality' idea, and thus take women to be pro-women, rather than pro-equality. \\n Feminists tend to base their notion of freedom on positive conceptions. That is, the better way to treat freedom is as 'freedom to' do something. They don't think questions of 'equality in lack of obstruction' are the interesting way to look at womens issues, but rather think a better approach is to study how effectively women can achieve certain ends when contrasted with males. They conclude that the playing field could hardly be said to be equal, and thus advocate for policies with aim towards making a real 'equality of oppurtunity' argument. \\n So, in saying they have no academic grounding, I am not sure if that is true. They have, either wittingly or unwittingly, adopted the negative conception of freedom (which is an academic idea). Also, in your second point, where MRA's dispute the fact whether women are more disadvantaged than men, it is important to see that their criteria of 'disadvantage' is different.\", 'If you\\'re point is that pragmatism is as ill-defined as truth, then you can\\'t make it\\'s ill-definition as a point for acceptance as preference for truth. I mean, from what you just said in that paragraph doesn\\'t stand. Until both of us elaborate on what we mean, then the discussion cannot continue. \\n Your second point elaborates on what a pragmatist could/should say (reading Rorty means we should preamble all coulds with shoulds =p). It depends on the explananundum and the explananda. You can put forth incredibly specific criteria\\'s of success, and people\\'s proposed explanations mightn\\'t meet those. So what? \\n People\\'s always think \\'pragmatism\\' is means-end orientated reasoning. I don\\'t think that\\'s what the pragmatists are saying. I think the pragmatists are saying is that if two theoretical explanations do not make a single predictive difference  (read: \"a difference in practice\"), then there is no real reason for choosing between them. Dennett\\'s  does  make a reason for choosing between his and dualist models: he makes a risky hypothesis. The dualists do not appear to be doing that. Dualists seem to just be ad hoc adjustments to satisfy their intuitions (my POV, not anyone elses.) \\n Nagel has to explicate upon that. Like, it\\'s okay to say empty possibilities. I want an observation. A labratory hypothesis that, if any non-pathological, informed person, looked, they would see the confirmation or disconfirmation, or at least evidence in its favour. I don\\'t think Nagel has proposed a risky conjecture, or what you stated is a risky conjecture.

It is simply the point that if we are going to posit something, it is either an explanatory object, or something be explained. The question we should ask is if qualia is something which fits either of those things. This depends on how you think explanatory work proceeds. \\n But none of your arguments raise any points in favour of dualism? Some points on how we might proceed: \\n \\n Do we want to do explanatory work in philosophy, or descriptive? \\n \\n Do we treat qualia as a phenomenon amenable to explanatory work, or not? \\n \\n Do we treat qualia as an explanatory conjecture in a theory, a posited entity/process used to explain other phenomena? How well does it do in its job? \\n \\n If former, The next question is what criteria of success do we stipulate on our method (Is it important for it to make testable predictions? Or is it enough to just have gut instincts?) \\n \\n These are the choices we make when proceeding. I take them to be pragmatic. You may take them to be truth-tropic or entirely misguided. But it is how I have approached the issue. \\n \\n \\n Judging from your comments though, I have got the impression that you have really misread pragmatism (in a very common way!). I would recommend Tartalagia\\'s book on Rorty in the Routledge Guidebook series, or The Cambridge companion to Pragmatism ed. Malachoswki for a more accurate view. (Though, ofc, it could be me that has horribly misread the pragmatist position)', \"First of all, the opening line, although being agreeable, simply isn't true. I agree with people contributing to making society prosper, but that isn't something a capitalism as an economic system selects for. Capitalism selects for the best profit-making activity, which may or may not be good or bad for society at large. \\n Secondly, the idea you proposed has been tried in history as a means of alleviating poverty. They were called work-houses and they were a complete disaster.  The schools idea could be fine, but what would the schools teach? How would the people be supported as they pursue education? \\n Thirdly, your argument is predicated on the idea that your right to life is determined by your ability to be an economically productive citizen. I disagree, though both Lenin and Capitalists love that idea. Be wary of your bed-fellows. \\n Fourthly, assuming you aren't advocating giving someone a means of profit making activity themselves, you are probably advocating that they work for someone else for wages. If you are assuming this, you are essentially saying that your right to life is dependent on your willingness to spend your time working for someone else. I don't think your life should be determined by how useful you are to private interests. Perhaps you disagree. \\n Fifthly, although you might advocate putting people into public work schemes, that can be ok, but we have to ask what a govt will do with a massive amount of unskilled labour. Thoreau made a comment on how debasing it is for humans to do useless work simply to earn their living. I think his example was of men tossing rocks over a wall, and having another group of men toss them back. \\n Sixthly, why don't we let people pursue their own interests, which they will do with greater fervour and more determination than in working for someone else's interests?

I am pretty sure in the biological sciences the support for evolution is a LOT higher than avg (but that's just speculation on my part) \\n *Obviously if people reject evolution, they're not going to find evolutionary psychology a fruitful endeavour. But that's about as interesting as saying that people who don't believe in children don't find developmental psychology a fruitful endeavour. \\n The reason the discipline struggles for credibility  amongst people who are in a real position to doubt it's credibility* is due to mainly two reasons. The first is that some believe that evolution is tautological and trivial. The second, which is the more powerful criticism, is that it is simply proferring pseudo-explanations and 'just so stories'. They argue that evolutionary psychology is essentially the occupation of creating plausible narratives. Whenever one combines these two criticisms, evolutionary psychology does appear to become a pseudo-science: \\n *However, as Steven Pinker points out (or as I take him to be pointing out) the creation of plausible narratives isn't a bad thing, they can suggest interesting avenues of further exploration.

If you approach someone aggressively, angrily, or without respect, you get just that in return.  Your conversation partner clams up, resorts to similar anger, or otherwise is lost to you.  Your points fall on deaf ears because you deafened them with the way you approached.  This is, similarly, my biggest critique on Dawkins; while interesting and sometimes visceral, what is his target audience?  Believers?  The tone of his books looses more of that audience then it endears.  Atheists?  Then it\\'s a reiteration, preaching to the choir, if you will. \\n If an atheist is to be heard and understood by one of a faith, the most important thing is to approach with kindness and respect.  You cannot for even one moment assume that being an atheist makes you \"better\" - superiority breeds contempt in the same way.  Approach them as equals, discuss fairly, reason logically, and above all be nice.  You will not win hearts or minds by being overly aggressive in the way you debate, but in being kind you make them stop and think.

Try to comprehend the complex symbioses of life.  Inward further, ponder the workings of our bodies, the complex biochemistry that runs every cell, and further the randomness and probability that they operate on in the micro scale. \\n Consider time as well; how much time has passed on [this planet alone]( or in the [universe as a whole](  Ponder the untold aeons that came before us, and that which will follow our demise. \\n And after you ponder all this, be humble.

This is especially true if said faith relies upon unsound or disprovable ideas.  For example, the geological data we have shows the idea of a world-wide flood false, and if you\\'re teaching your children that there really was one, that is likely to be challenged, as it is abjectly not true.  But in this case, it\\'s not the fault of anyone at the school; reality itself is the refuter, and reality is something we all must deal with. \\n I may be wrong, but I believe you\\'re actually a little misinformed, which is not a bad thing in and of itself.

However, it is quite likely that in the course of attending a school at which there are other people, and other people that do not hold to the precise faith in which the child is raised, they will learn of other beliefs, which can lead to questioning of their own.  In some cases, ones beliefs will be challenged by other students, or in certain courses by teachers as well; this can actually be seen as a good thing.  When ideas and beliefs are challenged, it can be an opportunity for use to learn more about ourselves.  Without it, no progress can be made, no bad ideas discarded or good ideas confirmed.  If every time one had an idea, we stuck with it forever without challenge, we would not survive. \\n I understand the fear you feel, that your children will be led astray by others\\' hands, but it is not necessary.  You\\'ve nothing to fear from education, save for greater learning.  One\\'s spiritual beliefs are just that; spiritual.

In the course of this analysis, either side may find something they don\\'t like or disagree with in their own beliefs; that\\'s only natural.  But this is a benefit, not a detriment; we can learn, grow, and change if something doesn\\'t work. \\n Of course, if you are teaching your children things that are indeed evidently false, and you know that, then your fear is valid.  After all, education is meant to teach what is correct, not falsehoods.  So as long as you actually know what you\\'re teaching your children, and you understand the basis and the reasons for what you\\'re teaching, you have nothing to fear at all.

And in that film of life: us.  Us, and every species that you've ever heard of, along with thousands that you haven't.  We exist, and we exist here.  We're not much, but we're here. \\n Try moving outward; [imagine the vastness of the solar system, of the galaxy, of the universe](  Try to grasp just [our galaxy]( with its billions of spinning stars and billions of planets orbiting them - hundreds of millions of which likely sit in the habitable zone, and may spawn life.  Imagine all the untold billions of other galaxies, each of which swirl with their own billions upon billions of stars, along with hundreds of millions of planets in the habitable zones of said stars - and billions that are not. \\n Try moving inward; grasp the [complexity]( of the [ecosystems]( of our planet, and the [weather]( and [geologic]( systems that interact with it.  Try to comprehend the complex symbioses of life.  Inward further, ponder the workings of our bodies, the complex biochemistry that runs every cell, and further the randomness and probability that they operate on in the micro scale. \\n Consider time as well; how much time has passed on [this planet alone]( or in the [universe as a whole](  Ponder the untold aeons that came before us, and that which will follow our demise. \\n And after you ponder all this, be humble.  Be humble in knowing that we are very, very young and very, very small.  We are insignificant and unimportant in the grand scheme of things.  The universe does not revolve around us, and our lives are less then the blink of an eye, quick sparks that surge and fade in an instant. \\n And yet, we are here. \\n We, you and I, are here, out of all the possible people, all the possible life, all the possible molecular arrangements - we are here.  Oh, we're not special; if we weren't here, something else would be, be it someone else, or a nebula waiting to form a star.  But we are unique.  We and what we experience are unique to us; it is temporary and fleeting, but it shall never occur again as we measure time.  We exist, and in existing, we can live and learn and experience. \\n And we prolong our existence; thanks to what we have learned, we can live quite a bit longer then our ancestors and distant relatives.  Our temporary lives get to go on a little longer, longer to savor and enjoy, longer to learn and to grow and - perhaps - to leave something.  How tragic it is that anyone would seek to end or harm the existence of another when there is so very much yet to do! \\n We have around us and within us an incredibly simple yet amazingly complex, patently unknown yet slowly discoverable universe, with more wonder and glory then any man-made myth.  There exists so much, so much to learn and to do - more then we could in hundreds of lifetimes.  And because it will end, because we  will  die, there can be change.  We can alter the world so that whomever comes after us will have something...different.  Better, if I may choose. \\n As far as we can tell, we have no purpose, no grand design.  And that means that we, and no one else, are free to choose our own paths, find our own goals, and do as we will. \\n I have my life.  My single, solitary, insignificant, short, challenging, interesting, engrossing, self-guided, wondrous life...\", \"I can't believe I didn't spot this earlier! \\n I'm sure you've all noticed by now that in the recent updates, our dear author has been taunting us with the rather creepy notion of...babies.  Yes, the tricksters seem rather enthused about this idea thanks to their massive lack of inhibitions and the sugar rush to end all rushes.  However, despite the fact that Jake makes a rather explicit reference to the way this typically occurs, there is another more likely option yet remaining: \\n Judging by Karkat's experience,  someone still has to do some ectobiology for the alpha kids' session .  Or does it? \\n Granted, I was expecting this would come closer to the reckoning (if such occurs), due to needing to send the kid-meteors back in time, but it could easily be part of the game handled by the trickster kids.  And hilarity will ensue. \\n Edit:  the consensus seems to be that this is inaccurate, owing to the shenanigans involved in how time travel is handled, and a statement by Doc Scratch about the trolls' session.  I admit that I had forgotten the latter detail; feel free to publicly apply shame.  And given the nature of time travel we've seen - such as the Dead Daves, Davesprite, and robo-Aradias - in which the paradox generated by an individual no longer deciding or being able to travel to fulfill that role- is handled by calling it a doomed timeline and killing the violator off (and to hell with the conservation of matter!), I will grant that it is indeed possible for the kids on both sides of the scratch to be explained by a single ectobiology session.  Or, in short, I admit that I am quite possibly wrong in my initial premise - and I must thank everyone who's been providing reasons why. \\n Mind you, that's got me thinking about the scratched session and the various other forms of split timelines that have been dealt with, and I have to wonder if a single ectobiology session would imply that one of the sets of kids is part of a doomed timeline by default, similar to Aradia's cloning ploy, without something else to turn it into a stable time loop or some further time shenanigans of some form.  While I am not entirely sold on the idea that Doc Scratch's statement on the glitch in the troll's session  precludes  the possibility that there was an ectobiolgoy session in the pre-scratch universe (he spoke of them originating from a different session yes, but if there were two sets of paradox clones formed - one in each session, they could have simply gotten criss-crossed; the group from pre landed in post, and post in pre), it occurs to me that aside from a set of paradox clones from the other respective sessions, this may be the point where Lord English gets his foot in the door - Doc Scratch also implies that the glitch in the troll's session is a sign of his presence, a sort of actualization which is waiting for something to come along and potentate it, if you will; a causal niche for him to fill - though by the same token, it's unclear if anything of the like is implied for the kids' sessions.  Or perhaps I'm just thinking about this too much.  I shall revise this as people continue to provide disproof of concepts; thanks for being good sports about my rambling, everyone!\", \"Well, you answered my question exactly: we shall go over the theories as they are currently established. \\n Oh, and for what it's worth, I didn't make an argument from authority, as I did not assume the authority was infallible.  Neither was it an argument by popularity.  I simply stated that the most learned men have been working on this theory since its inception, and it has fit beautifully to the evidence that arose with the advent of genetics.  I am not saying we have authority, and therefore are correct; I'm saying that's what the evidence points to, as supported by the scientific consensus.  Further, my wiki link is not mealy the ramblings of one individual, but a gathering of various evidences for evolution with a well-cited collection of scientific works.  You will note that each major point has a citation to a scientific paper or journal describing the results supporting the direct conclusion.  You cannot discount the article without also discounting those sources. \\n Now, before we launch into the evidence and formulation of the theory, we need to make a distinction.  The theory of evolution is separate from abiogenisis.  Abiogenisis is about the origins of life, while evolution is about what happens once there is life.  Abiogenisis is actually totally unnecessary to the theory of evolution; so long as there is life, evolution occurs and applies, no matter how that life arose.  The point is, simply, that the two exist separately; they may agree with one another, but they aren't reliant on each other\u2019s existence.  Hence, we will speak of them separately. \\n To start with, on evolution.  While we could discuss the theory since its beginning and all the verifications that have happened sense, it would likely be easier to discuss the current theory and its direct support; including genetics, for example, instead of starting with Darwin and moving to Crick later.  I must warn you, it will be difficult to attain a full understanding of evolution in a single sitting, due to the various fields that have contributed evidence.  At the bare minimum, I'm going to have to give you a primer on basic biology, zoology, genetics, and biochemistry (which I am well qualified for), and possibly chemistry, geology, physics, paleontology, immunology, and microbiology as well.  I rather doubt I will be able to do this in a single post, but I'll do what I can.  Feel free to ask questions as we go if something doesn't make sense. \\n First, it is important to recognize the earth is old.  Very, very, very old.  The geologic clock I provided earlier is a scale demonstration of how old the earth is.  It is my assumption that I don't need to go over the evidence for an old earth, but if you wish, I can demonstrate its age. \\n Now, onto life.  Life currently exists on this planet, and we can demonstrate that it has been around for a very, very long time as well.  Living creatures are composed of cells.  Within cells are various pieces of biological machinery that allows the cell to function.  What is known as the central dogma of biology relates to the function of genetic information, which is what we shall address here.  Each cell contains a copy of a creature's DNA. \\n DNA , and upon each ribose is bonded a nitrogenous base in the form of Adenine, Guanine, Thymine, and Cytosine, or A, G, T, and C for short.  DNA exists as a dimer; two complimentary DNA molecules are hydrogen bonded to each other and coiled in a double helix.  What is meant by complimentary is that, due to the size and hydrogen bonding involved, A bonds to T and C to G. \\n DNA is used as the template for the formation of  RNA  instead of Thymine (T).  It is chemically less stable then DNA, which is why DNA has come to be a storage molecule and RNA a transfer molecule.  RNA also shows much higher catalytic ability then DNA, and it comes in many, many types; cells use RNA for quite a few interesting functions.  For the moment, let us focus on a specific sort, messenger RNA (mRNA). \\n The point of mRNA is to carry a message from DNA to the ribosomes.  It is built by a complex of proteins (a group working together) as a complimentary strand to one strand of DNA, which means is it\u2019s As, Gs, Ts, and Cs are based upon the strand it\u2019s being build of; it uses one side of the DNA as a template, and it is essentially a copy of the other side.  This process is known as transcription.  Following, the mRNA is escorted to ribosomes, where the ribosome reads the \u201ccode\u201d.  We\u2019ve already mentioned that there are four letters, the four bases, in DNA & RNA; the genetic language, if you will, is written in three-letter words known as codons.  The ribosome, which is itself a ribozyme (protein/RNA complex used enzymatically), assembles around the strand of mRNA and then reads down it, three letters at a time.  Each three letters corresponds to a specific amino acid, one of the twenty types used by all living things, which are attached to each other in the order given by the mRNA to assemble a protein.  This process is known as Translation \\n Proteins, to be brief, are long chains of amino acids (polymers) which are used in life for structure, signaling, catalysis, and various other tasks.  They are the final product of each gene we have; at its most basic, DNA can be thought of as the blueprints for proteins, though there\u2019s a bit more to it then that.  Proteins themselves undergo changes as well; the shape, or conformation, of a protein is what determines what it does and how it does it.  In many cases, there are multiple stable conformations of protein, and to get the one desired they must be given the right folding environment by other proteins.  Further, their conformation can be actively changed by the surrounding environment, or what bonds to them.  Indeed, that is one way proteins are regulated by other proteins; attaching and altering their shape.  Further, as mentioned, proteins can form complexes, working together to fulfill a function.  It is very important to here note that protein folding is heavily dependant on what amino acids are in it, and in what order.  In some cases, a single change can prevent a protein from working at all. \\n Now, I\u2019m going to stop here for the moment; to help you understand the processes going on, here are a few videos; the first one especially is important: \\n I will also remind you that, as mentioned at the beginning, we\u2019re going to address evolution first; abiogenisis will be tackled after.\"]": "Based on the postings, the user is interested in atheism, evolution, philosophy, and humanism.", "['Depends. \\n No seriously, This is such a wide and complex question with so little context.

Modern Muggle USA is shaped significantly by immigration from Europe. If the US wizarding society is to be similar to US Muggle society then it\\'s fair to say that the same would have to be true. Now, most people migrated to the US for either economic reasons or idealistic/religious reasons. Would there have been a similar drive in wizarding society? I decided not, at least for my world. \\n There were a number of factors leading to no similar migration to the New World. \\n Firstly, it presented no significant increase in economic opportunities. Wizards have as much land as they could possibly desire, both due to their low population and ability to warp space. So if wizards wanted more land they could just have it in Europe. \\n Secondly, by the time the US was discovered by Europeans (I decided that the Muggles discovered the Americas before the wizards, as wizards have a significantly lower propensity to explore geographically. They\\'re much inward looking, feeling that they have everything they want already.) the Immortality magics were well developed, which meant that the European population was extremely old and therefore more entrenched. \\n Thirdly, while wizarding society is extremely classist, most people (other than Muggleborns) didn\\'t feel actively repressed. This can be attributed to a number of sources: firstly, the fact that the nobility had convinced the lower classes of the meritocratic ideal, even if it was a warped meritocratic ideal. The very existence of an entrenched nobility who guarded knowledge to preserve their power defies a meritocracy. Nevertheless, the population at large was convinced of it - not unlike the way many modern Americans remain convinced of the possibility of the \"American Dream\", despite all the barriers against it. Further, life in Europe was pretty good at this time for even those of the lower classes. Wealth and power were flowing into Europe, and especially Britain, following Merlin\\'s Conquest. \\n Fourthly, as was mentioned above, the nobility guarded knowledge. Above all, they guarded the Immortality magics. Migrating to the New World meant leaving this centre of expertise. Unless you could cast the spells yourself (in which case you likely were either from the nobility, or on your way to becoming part of that world), moving away was almost like accepting a death sentence. \\n So there wasn\\'t a massive migration to the New World. Certainly there was some migration by Muggleborns and people with a chip on their shoulder. But, importantly, this migration was not significant enough to overrun the already existing Native American magical culture. \\n So, given this, what does modern US magical culture look like? \\n The US population is split about 50/50 in terms of Native American and European ethnicity. Most of the European side isn\\'t from European immigrants but from Muggleborns from the US Muggle culture. \\n However, the magical culture is very much dominated by the Native Americans. The European side has drifted in so slowly over the years that they got absorbed into the Native American culture rather than overriding it. Further, the Immortality magics took a long time to reach North America, and when they did the magical people there rejected them as unnatural. On the other hand, the Europeans were not so scrupulous. They took from the Native American culture everything they thought could be of value. Foremost of these was the secret of how to make Totem Poles, extremely powerful protective objects that the British Legions use to this day. \\n US magical culture is very tied in with spirituality, unlike European magical culture. There is no central government, nor are there magical schools in the sense that there are in Europe. Muggleborns are routinely detected and told about magic, but they don\\'t go away to a magical school. Often, they don\\'t even leave home. They\\'ll simply spend time with whoever the local wizards are, learning their ways. They may choose to become fully part of that culture, or continue to live on in the Muggle culture, treating their magic like a religion or hobby. The Statute of Secrecy was not something that US magical culture particularly liked or wanted to enter into. They were essentially forced into it, after seeing the kind of punishment other magical nations had suffered at the hands of international forces for rejecting it. \\n US magical culture is therefore very small compared to European culture and uses a very different type of magic. They reject both wands and immortality magic. They are particularly gifted with a unique type of magic involving animals, and have powerful shape-shifting abilities that put the animagus transformation to shame. They also are good at healing magic, divination, and potions, though all of these are meant in a different sense to their European counterparts. US practitioners of magic, however, do not have powerful magic suited for combat. That\\'s not to say they have no magic that can be used to attack people with, it\\'s just that it\\'s a) quite subtle and b) weak compared to wand magic. \\n US magical culture is rather overshadowed by a magical superpower to their south, the Mayan civilisation. This is the only civilisation to discover how to make oneself immortal before Europe, though it is not nearly so easy as the European way: the general population is not immortal as is the case for Europe, and so there is a much smaller population (though still quite large compared to canon population). However, the greatest of the Mayans can extend their life indefinitely through ritual sacrifice. These sacrifices also increase these wizards\\' power. There are wizards in this culture who were alive in 1500BC, and so are far older than their European counterparts. A handful of these wizards are also frighteningly powerful. Only three things prevented a Mayan conquest of Europe: the versatility and power of wand magic, the very large European magical population, and the threat of Merlin. \\n The Mayans also rejected European immortality magic and wands, but unlike the Native American wizards, the Mayans have their own extremely powerful magic - powerful enough that they were the only magical nation that Merlin did not risk attempting to subjugate when he created the ICW and the Statute of Secrecy. Rather, an alliance was reached - an alliance which resulted in the complete disappearance of the Mayan civilisation as they were brought into the Statute of Secrecy. This disappearance remains a mystery to modern Muggle academics.', 'I didn\\'t mean for the Muggle idea of nutrition to be completely overturned, but rather modified.

We\\'ve never seen any HP spell overcome by a physical force, only magical forces, and JKR\\'s extra-book comments generally talk about how magic is completely separate from physical forces and able to completely override them.

Hume almost certainly did not have atoms in mind. \\n \"Substance\" in the rationalist tradition doesn\\'t really mean matter in any modern conception. It\\'s a somewhat more metaphysical/religious idea. Substance is the thing that constitutes the basis of reality. It\\'s the essence of stuff, of being. For example in Spinoza, substance = God, because he was pantheist. \\n So when Hume denied substance, he wasn\\'t really saying anything about what makes up matter as we understand it now. The fact that atoms are mostly empty space doesn\\'t affect it much - even that empty space has being (spacial dimension). \\n And note that even if Hume were talking about atoms, he\\'d be very wrong. While atoms are mostly \"empty space\", you do still have the nucleus and electrons (though I believe that is a significant simplification, as the subatomic particles that make up atoms aren\\'t really little balls flying around. Much of that so-called empty space will be part of the electron cloud). \\n This is all connected to the idea of dualism. Descartes\\' philosophy had two substances: mental substance and extended substance (physical stuff). Spinoza thought there was a problem with that - namely how the two interacted if they were of different substances, so conceived of the world as consisting of just one substance, which was god. And then Hume came along and was sceptical of the whole lot. He denied our ability to know the true basis of reality. All we could know was our sense perceptions - phenomena. It was a mistake to infer from these perceptions a lawful reality underlying it all, he thought - the problem of induction. \\n And then Kant came along and shewed him what was what.', \"My theory, which I've mentioned before: I don't think he's going to wrap up the frame story in this trilogy. \\n \\n There's not enough space in one book, even a very large one, to finish Kvothe's tale and also return to the present and sort out everything there.

I think we may get a resolution to Kote's identity crisis as a result of him telling his story, but I don't think we're going to see the resolution of this war Kvothe started, and I definitely don't think we're going to see him catch up with the Chandrian. Both of those would take whole books to do properly, at the current pace of narration. \\n \\n We know there's going to be more books in the Kingkiller world. \\n \\n The Kingkiller world is huge and Kvothe's tale is just one part of it. Kvothe's personal story may reach some kind of conclusion, but the world goes on. In that sense things won't be wrapped up, ever. \\n \\n \\n Now, Pat has said that there won't be more books about Kvothe. But consider: \\n \\n Names are important. No more books about Kvothe, maybe. But what about Kote? \\n \\n In one interview where he said there would be no more books about Kvothe, he also said that he had lied about one thing in the interview. \\n \\n Pat does not like giving information about the Kingkiller world outside of the books (the coin conversion app being the major exception). I think his writing philosophy is that everything should be revealed embedded in the narrative. I believe he goes out of his way to avoid talking about even the most mundane details of the Four Corners or Kingkiller plot in interviews for this reason. Revealing that there would be more books about Kvothe after the current trilogy would therefore be a massive spoiler for Pat, and something he would be completely against.\", \"I would remove the following lines from HBP: \\n >Charms: E \\n I always thought that Harry should have got an O in Charms. He can cast a Patronus, after all, which is a Charm, and his summing charm in GoF was very impressive, summoning an object from over a mile away. Plus his shield charm is extremely strong. I think Harry has quite a bit of talent in Charms. Though he often has to work hard to get the hang of a spell, once he can cast it properly he tends to be very good at it. \\n Next we have: \\n >Not only were they studying as though they had exams every day, but the lessons themselves had become more demanding than ever before. Harry barely understood half of what Professor McGonagall said to them these days; even Hermione had had to ask her to repeat instructions once or twice. \\n And similarly: \\n >Harry rather doubted he would be able to bring off this particular spell; he was still having difficulty with nonverbal spells, something Snape had been quick to comment on in every D.A.D.A. class. \\n I feel like these passages beat up on Harry unnecessarily. I don't expect Harry to be as good as Hermione at picking up new magic, but at the same time there's no need to make him seem so bad at it. Him being this average at magic doesn't do anything for the plot, so it's in there for the sole purpose of making Harry seem average. \\n Personally I prefer a talented Harry. Not prodigious, sure, but still, the guy wants to be an Auror. He should have a grasp of magic consummate with those that enter that profession (a profession so selective that most years they don't accept any new trainees). \\n It also undermines a lot of what happened in previous books. Harry was able to resist the Imperius curse and defeat Voldemort in priori incantatum, both feats of sheer mental willpower. Then JKR has him struggle with non-verbal magic, which Snape says is a matter of mental power. \\n Harry teaches the DA in OotP and it seems like he genuinely is leading and teaching them, showcasing that yes, he is talented beyond that of a normal 5th year. Then he enters 6th year and struggles in his best subject, DADA. Apparently the twins were just humouring him throughout OotP, not mentioning once that actually Harry wasn't even at the level of a 6th year. \\n The upshot of all of this is that Harry relies on Hermione more than ever for magical input, though at times in DH he comes out with magic that you wonder where the hell he learnt, because it sure wasn't covered in HBP and doesn't match how Harry was depicted in 6th year.\"]": "Based on the summarized postings, the user is interested in the following areas:\n\n1.

Changes made in the past don\\'t branch off, they actively overwrite and replace the pre-existing timeline. \\n It\\'s debatable whether or not this is the norm for Star Trek or that other theories of time travel are more accurate. \\n To elaborate, here are the major theories of time travel: \\n Set Timeline (One Timeline; Cannot Overwrite, Causal Loop-Friendly) \\n Let\\'s say you\\'ll attempt to kill your grandfather. You have a gun, see him on the street, aim, and pull the trigger. \\n But the bullet doesn\\'t hit him. The gun misfires, or misses, or jams because we know that that can\\'t happen. In this theory of time travel there is only one line, and it cannot be overwritten. If you make changes in the past they will either fail or discover that [you already changed the past.]( \\n This allows for some pretty neat stuff.  Bill and Ted\\'s Excellent Adventure  uses this theory to do stuff like promise that they will supply themselves with stuff they don\\'t have yet, then send it back in time. \\n Say you\\'re locked in a cell, but know that you can eventually have access to time travel.

This is what\\'s known as  causal loops . \\n A Causal Loop is when something\\'s cause can also be it\\'s effect.

I have a few questions and thoughts, and I figured this would be a fine place to put them. You can reply if you want, but I\\'m just gonna dump some of my thoughts and some of the things I liked or didn\\'t like. Enjoy. Or not. Either way. \\n Starting the Show and its Strengths \\n Nobody told me anything about this show, I only knew that people liked it, so I told myself I\\'d give it a shot... Nobody warned me that I\\'d have to scrape my way through the first few episodes (first 4 I think) as they were really not the best, and they were difficult to get into without any prior knowledge of anything. (I bet I\\'d enjoy them now that I know the characters and what the show is all about) The show starts out really cheesy (which is fine) and doesn\\'t have the best flow... But you start to get to know the characters through relationships that start to form. This is, in my opinion, Doctor Who\\'s strong point. Relationships. The Doctor, the companions, their families and friends... It\\'s all good. \\n Musing on the Episodic Nature of the Show \\n So after finally getting into the show a little bit more I had a couple problems. It bothered me that individual episodes didn\\'t seem to necessarily... matter? There are a few blips here and there that carry over, but there was no overlying plot. There were also some really creepy and excellent episodes that I really did not expect. Really good stuff. But still some episodes that really didn\\'t hit home... and I wasn\\'t really sure what to make of the \"first\" (9th) Doctor. \\n Finishing Series One \\n It wasn\\'t until we started reaching the end of season one that I really was in love with the characters. Rose was EXCELLENT. The Doctor was great, Jack was great...even the \"background\" characters were coming into fruition in a good way... The last couple episodes of season 1 were REALLY fantastic. Loved it. Rose not allowing herself to be separated from the Doctor, the Doctor trying to hopelessly save everyone be destroying himself... Just all sorts of good. The massive army of Dalek\\'s that were supposed to be extinct made these episodes EXTRA important. The future of the earth was going to be decided in a second. \\n The whole \"bad wolf\" thing gave the series some much needed continuity as well. The way it ended was... well... excellent. It was emotional, characters were changing, and the plot progressed in a MAJOR way. Also, Rose was AWESOME. Given all of the power she had, she showed her true self. She was truly good. BUT we were losing the 9th Doctor and he was being replaced with somebody new. Somebody I had doubts about because I liked number 9. Doubts that REALLY didn\\'t last very long AT ALL. \\n Series Two \\n Season 2 was more of the same hit or miss for me... But again, the best thing about it was the relationships. Rose and the new Doctor had some REAL chemistry, and other characters progressed as well. At this point I assumed that the series was about Rose and her adventures with the Doctor. Again I had the complaint that individual episodes didn\\'t necessarily matter and there were some points that just really didn\\'t hit with me... But again, as the show went on and we approached the end of the season... it just got better and better. \\n Losing a Companion \\n As I said before, at this point I thought that this show was about the Doctor and his adventures with Rose Tyler. Doomsday came as a... surprise. The finale did not pull any emotional punches, and I was upset. I\\'m not really a crier when it comes to entertainment, and this wasn\\'t an exception... But it made me.. grumpy. I was grumpy and a bit emotional. Rose was gone, but Rose in my mind COULDN\\'T be gone and have the show continue. When they said their goodbyes I was even more grumpy and emotional. The Doctor didn\\'t get to tell Rose that he loved her. Upsetting. \\n Series Three \\n Season 3... Season 3, season 3, season 3. Evidently my attachment to Rose Tyler at this point was pretty strong. I was upset, he just sort of immediately got a new companion (a Rose replacement?!) and that seemed to be that. I appreciated the fact that he seemed to be hurting at least, although he was kind of unintentionally a jerk to Martha\u2026 I spent the first 6 episodes grumpy that Rose \"wasn\\'t back yet\" and that the Doctor didn\\'t even seem to be trying. \\n More on Losing a Companion \\n Then I realized... She\\'s not coming back. This show isn\\'t about Rose and the Doctor. It\\'s about the Doctor. It took me that realization to even give our new companion a chance. Martha Jones was fine. She was strong in a different way. Helpful, smart, different. But I was still bitter that there was no Rose. \\n This is where things got tougher to keep watching for me. Don\\'t get me wrong, Martha was pretty cool and definitely wasn\\'t like Rose and that\\'s not a bad thing. Here we get more episodes that don\\'t really matter at all, and some good ones. The Doctor himself continues to be fun to watch. The later episodes once again were fantastic. The Master was an excellent villain, and things REALLY escalated in a good way. Still no Rose. Hmm\u2026 But a great finale. \\n More Frustration With the Episodic Nature of the Show \\n At this point, however, the frustration is growing. We\\'re all the way onto season 4, and most episodes STILL don\\'t matter. When I say that what I mean is that there is no cohesive PLOT to go through from episode to episode. \\n This bothers me. It\\'s like watching a kids cartoon where you could simply pop in and out of watching without missing much. Not only that, but the things that they DO build up (the EXCELLENT relationships) tend to be shoved to the side a bit whenever we DO get into something new. BAH. But I press on towards season 4. \\n Donna as Companion \\n Season 4 gets us a new companion yet again. Here we have Donna Donna is NOTHING like the previous companions. That is not a bad thing. Their relationship is unique. They don\\'t obviously love each other like Rose and the Doctor did, she doesn\\'t feel like second best and a replacement Rose like Martha did, she\\'s just unique. Through the season you realize the best thing about her is that she\\'s \"ordinary\" and that she doesn\\'t seem special. But oh is she ever special. \\n Series Four Plot \\n This season we get hints sort of like the whole \"bad wolf\" thing that something special is going on. It\\'s minor, but it seems like an effort to have plot progression. I approve\u2026 and then\u2026 We get to see Rose again! Yeah, Rose. I keep bringing her up. I thought the show was about her and the doctor from the start, so leave me alone. haha. \\n Thoughts on the Finale \\n Moving forward a bit we get into the AMAZING season finale again. FANTASTIC. Not only does EVERYTHING finally come together, all of the characters all of the relationships all of the companions all of the everything. It ends in spectacular fashion. All of the characters stories are completed. Martha is married and living an adventurous life on Earth\u2026 Donna saves everything that ever was and unfortunately has to lose her memories of the previous events to live her life away from the Doctor,  and Rose gets her very own Doctor. EVERYTHING was wrapped up neat and tidy, and it was good. The series could have easily ended right here and now, and it would have been a great ending. \\n Looking back at Series 1-4 \\n This show just got better and better and better during seasons 1-4. For me, it went from meh, to solid, to actually being pretty good. I still wished that the episodes had more continuity and meaning, but the finales were so good and the relationships were done so well that things were just dandy. The emotional range of the Doctor himself was REALLY impressive. Things were good. \\n Here is where I start to have some serious problems. \\n Enter Moffat \\n I didn\\'t even like in Season 3 (or 4) when we had to just move on with the new companions, but at least the previous seasons really mattered. The previous seasons impacted the Doctor in major ways and he carried that with him with every passing moment. I watched the specials and whatever was \"in between\" season 4 and season 5. Those were all well and good. HOWEVER when we move into the actual season 5, there is a problem. \\n It is as if they stealth re-booted the series. NOTHING that happened previously has any significance at all. None of the previous companions. None of the lessons learned as the previous Doctor\u2026 Nothing. I\\'ve never seen anything quite like it. \\n How frustrating is this? I can\\'t possibly be the only one who thought this. It\\'s not the new Doctor\\'s fault either, he does very well and shows good emotional range, he\\'s unique, it\\'s always fun when he says something is \"cool\" like bow-ties and what not. \\n Moffat\\'s Companions \\n So the problem isn\\'t the Doctor. So is it the new companions? Amy Pond is unique, and she\\'s traveling with her husband, so that\\'s a\u2026 different\u2026 sort of relationship. Rory also DEFINITELY has his moments. Some of the stuff is really cool, the lone centurion for example was really great. He really, REALLY loves Amy Pond. \\n And that\\'s great\u2026 But wait. I find myself just not caring at all. I just do not care about these characters, I do not care about these episodes, and I do not even really care about the Doctor. Alright, that one might not be true. But I\\'m just so frustrated. So many things are done wrong in the midst of so many things being done right. \\n Overarching Plots in Moffat\\'s Era \\n My previous complaints about episodes not mattering is completely gone in seasons 5 and 6, the overarching stories of these seasons is done VERY very well. It can\\'t be easy to write and overarching story for a time traveling guy who goes from place to place backwards and forwards on whims, but it was done wonderfully. \\n The quality of the show had risen, I didn\\'t really notice when it happened but some time ago the series just stopped being cheesy in a negative way. The scale of the episodes was grand and well done. \\n River\\'s Tale and Connecting the Doctors \\n River\\'s storyline was REALLY cool. HOWEVER, I find myself not enjoying it nearly as much. They just brushed everything previous under the rug, and I just really do not like that. Yes, the story lines of the previous companions and characters were pretty well completed. It makes sense to not just thrust them into new seasons where that isn\\'t necessary\u2026 HOWEVER, the DOCTOR is still here, and because the Doctor is still here, there should be memories\u2026 Reflections\u2026 SOMETHING that pulls the series together. \\n I\\'m sure that in between this new Doctor Who and the series that existed long long long ago the same thing occurs, there is no reference to much anything that happens before our 9th Doctor\u2026 But there is a problem here. THAT was a reboot, and this was just SEASON 5! \\n Am I the only one who feels this way? Is the \"fandom\" split? I just can\\'t stand it, and don\\'t have any drive to catch up past season 6. I also feel like season 6 is YET ANOTHER spot where the series could have/should have ended. \\n I don\\'t know why I\\'ve typed all this up, and I don\\'t even expect anyone to really reply because its so much text, I just figured I\\'d put down some of my thoughts.', 'Moffat changes once he becomes showrunner through the character of Amy Pond. \\n Ameilia (and I will make the distinction as this is the little Amelia Pond the Doctor first encounters) is shown to be immensely brave despite her age and quite independent (she can cook for herself, deal with the Doctor, live without her Aunt). \\n But when we leap forward we see a very different character who immediately hinders the Doctor\\'s process via a cricket bat to the head and handdcuffing him to a radiator (without keys). \\n She lies to him that she is a police woman  and  lies to him about not being Amy Pond, ignores his warnings both not to go into the room  and  not to look Prisoner Zero in the face any of these things could have easily gotten her and the Doctor killed (well, save lying about who she was, although backup may have been helpful). \\n She hinders him further by slamming his tie in a car door just as he realizes how to save the planet in the precious minutes allotted to him (endangering the entire planet just so she could berate the Doctor a bit more for leaving her). \\n We see her treat her boyfriend with belittlement (not really addressing him as her boyfriend, calling her other friend \"the good-looking one\" in front of him. We see her as a kissogram, a very sexualized role for a woman. We also see her decidedly  not  looking away as the Doctor changes, showing her character be further tied to sex and sexual desire than most other companions. \\n Throughout her tenure in the first series she \"runs off with a strange man on her wedding night\" (her words, she left her wedding ring there for that very reason), constantly and consistently nags both the Doctor and Rory (often insulting, belittling, or hitting Rory) and nigh always is seen in a short skirt or revealing clothing (Time & Space furthers this sexualization of her character, pinning Rory dropping the transistor as \"her fault\" for being so sexy). She immediately tries to bed the Doctor not loong after going on adventures with him (her dress and the fact that the planet in Time of Angels is \"her first other planet\" further point to the brief duration of time) despite her clearly acknowledging that this would be cheating on her fiancee. \\n But this is simply Amy. Just one character who behaves in this frankly stereotypical \"sexualized nagging female\" does not mean Moffat\\'s undergone a total departure from his days of strong female leads. \\n But sadly it is not limited to her. When we see River again she is not the wise professor we met, but a high-heeled, slinky dressed, winking, flirty, kissing ball of sexualization and sexy gun-toting. True that in situations of duress she buckles down and drops the childish flirting, but through out her appearances in Series Five and Six these aspects have become major aspects of her character. Even her  Mels persona  is dripping with sex and obsession over the Doctor. \\n Even the TARDIS herself is referred to for the very first time as \"sexy\" in The Eleventh Hour. Even in A Christmas Carol the female characters only serve as motivation for the male characters, with Evelyn acting as essentially a precious possession for Kazran. \\n Much like George Lucas shifting from the very independent Marion Ravenwood to the garish stereotype of Wily from Raiders of the Lost Ark to Temple of Doom one wonders if Moffat went through his own \"woman problems\" to have such a negative view of women to the point where the Doctor literally has the line  \"of course she\\'s difficult, she\\'s a woman!\"  in Let\\'s Kill Hitler.', 'Many people have balked about the casting of the notably white Benedict Cumberbatch as Khan, a character quite famously originally played by the notably Latin Ricardo Montalban (although Khan\\'s meant to be Indian, but that\\'s a whole other kettle of fish). \\n But truth be told, there seems to be a legitimate method to the madness. So many have chalked up the change to typical Hollywood whitewashing or an attempt to avoid the possible offense of showing a darker-skinned terrorist character, but there are a couple of key elements that lead me to a different conclusion. \\n You see, to take everyone back to November of 2011: [Benecio Del Toro was approached to play the film\\'s villain]( and was seemingly in a lock, with many sources reporting he had signed on. \\n But due to Benecio Del Toro\\'s resemblance, the immediate assumption was that he would be playing Khan. \\n This presumably caused major issues for J.J. and company, who had gone to painstaking lengths to keep the identity of the antagonist a total secret. (As those who\\'ve seen the film know, the reveal of Khan\\'s identity is a big Act Two twist). \\n Obviously there were attempts to keep the identity still secret, despite the tidal wave of new assumptions. J.J. flat out said when asked whether Del Toro was playing Khan as [\"not true\",]( but that didn\\'t stem the reports that Khan would be appearing in \"Star Trek 2\". \\n So what was the solution? How could they throw people back off the scent? Shortly after buzz that Del Toro would be Khan, [he ended up dropping out, just two months before filming.](', 'Alright, I\\'ll play devil\\'s advocate here: \\n The audios and tie-in novels are and always have been a fairly niche product, and were a leftover from the show\\'s off-time in the \\'90s. It was actually recommended by the BBC to shut down the Big Finish series, but RTD said \"I\\'ll handle it\" and then promptly preserved it\\'s licence. \\n My point to the audios are that there\\'s not a huge struggle between audiences. There\\'s absolutely no risk of confusing audiences what series is Doctor Who and more importantly for the BBC, no budget they have to pay. Production costs and marketing are all done on other companies\\' dimes (and cost vastly less than the cost of the show proper).\\n Be it Penguin books, Target books, Big Finish, or IDW, the BBC doesn\\'t foot the bill for these off-television ventures. \\n Torchwood and The Sarah Jane Adventures were proposed not by some outsider, but by the creative lead himself. These two shows were  very  different from this proposed series and were trying to be Doctor Who about as much as Frasier was trying to be Cheers. They don\\'t confuse nor split audiences and again are made by the same showrunner and share many of the same assets and crew. There\\'s a massive manageability factor there, both in cost and in management. \\n And if anything the BBC\\'s forays into animation with Doctor Who would encourage them  not  to try it again.  Scream of the Shalka  looked dreadful and was completely ignored by the public at large.  Dreamland  was a complete failure, the animated adventures with Martha equally so. Their only successes have been with the reconstructions and even that response is mild. \\n They likely cancelled the idea for the same reason they cancelled the idea for Nelvana to make their animated show: They aren\\'t going to just hand off one of their most iconic and profitable assets to a complete unknown outsider who might very well butcher the damn thing. \\n I mean really, what can we tell from these concepts? That the artstyle\\'s earliest version looks nice. We see nothing about how it will look animated (which likely could have been as bad as the BBC\\'s Flash-based animations so far if we\\'re to expect that they\\'d give the project a miniscule budget, which they would have) or, more importantly, what the writing or average episode would be like.', 'But that makes no sense.

Good stuff from [Wikipedia]( on this: \\n \"In 19th and early 20th century medicine and psychology, an \"idiot\" was a person with a very severe intellectual disability. In the early 1900s, Dr. Henry H. Goddard proposed a classification system for intellectual disability based on the Binet-Simon concept of mental age. Individuals with the lowest mental age level (less than three years) were identified as idiots; imbeciles had a mental age of three to seven years, and morons had a mental age of seven to ten years. The term \"idiot\" was used to refer to people having an IQ below 30. \\n A few authors have used \"idiot\" characters in novels, plays and poetry. Often these characters are used to highlight or indicate something else (allegory). Examples of such usage are William Faulkner\\'s The Sound and the Fury and William Wordsworth\\'s The Idiot Boy. Idiot characters in literature are often confused with or subsumed within mad or lunatic characters. The most common imbrication between these two categories of mental impairment occurs in the polemic surrounding Edmund from William Shakespeare\\'s King Lear. In Fyodor Dostoevsky\\'s novel The Idiot, the idiocy of the main character, Prince Lev Nikolaievich Myshkin, is attributed more to his honesty, trustfulness, kindness, and humility, than to a lack of intellectual ability. Nietzsche claimed, in his The Antichrist, that Jesus was an idiot. This resulted from his description of Jesus as having an aversion toward the material world.\" \\n And this page on [IQ]( \\n \"The US military has minimum enlistment standards at about the IQ 85 level.

When the show ended, I parted ways with the girl; who\\'s name or number I never learned :\\'(  . \\n As the crowd dispersed, I remained at the rail, waiting for Wayne to come back out and hoping I would get the autographs I brought my vinyl for. Wayne did come out and he snapped some pictures with the few people who were waiting there with me. My phone was dead and I couldn\\'t get a picture, though now I\\'m super upset I didn\\'t get a photo with those other people and wayne, as the  pictures are now on twitter , and if I waited at the side of the stage he\\'d come back out. I said alright, cause when Wayne tells you to and wait for him, you go and wait for him. \\n Twenty minutes pass, and I am beginning to think Wayne is busy with groupies and has forgot all about me. Just as I consider leaving and catching the next show, I see him come out with a guard and point at me. The guard opens a gate and leads me to a backstage area where Wayne is talking to the few dozen girls who were invited on stage for the show. Also backstage were the members of few of the smaller bands that performed that weekend: \"Big Something\" and \"Tornado Rider\". While Wayne spoke and signed stuff for the girls I shot the shit with these smaller bands, and those guys were super chill. Eventually Wayne finishes talking to the girls and they disperse. When he finally makes his way to me, there is practically nobody left. I\\'m as close to 1 on 1 with a celebrity of his stature as I ever have been. This man had just blown my mind with some the craziest shit I had ever seen on stage just an hour earlier, and now I was gonna talk to him. It was really humid out and close to 80 degrees. I\\'m still rolling hard and sweating profusely. He walks up to me and says \"you waited!\" and gives me a big hug. Usually I would be too starstruck to really have any kind of conversation with him, but the drugs helped me get past that and I ended up speaking to him for a good 15 minutes about the festival, music I like and have seen live and similar topics. He signs my records and we talk about vinyl vs. digital releases and the collaborations he has been putting out over the summer. I found it funny that Wayne couldn\\'t tell which of the collaborations he was signing and had to ask me. As we were talking, the final act of the festival, STS9 came on stage and started playing. I walked with him to the field and stood around at the far end of the stage watching the show for a while before some other people in the crowd realized that Wayne Coyne was just standing around amongst them. I thanked Wayne and he thanked me back and gave me another hug. The culmination of the events of that evening/weekend (and the drugs) made that hug just fill me with love and joy that I have rarely experienced. I walked back into the crowd floating on air, feeling like a million bucks. It\\'s now been about 48 hours since it all happened and it still feels surreal. I\\'m a bit hung up on the fact that I didn\\'t get a photo with Wayne, but the [signed vinyl]( makes up for that, I think. \\n At this point I\\'ve just been spinning my Flaming Lips records nonstop, trying to figure out how I can afford to see them in S. Carolina next month. I am glad to have another band I can say is one of my favorites and to have another experience I will remember for the rest of my life. \\n Sorry for the wall of text.']": "Based on the reddit postings, it seems that the user is interested in the following areas:\n\n1.

Eostre for springtime, whenever the weather decides to act like it\\'s springtime (whether that\\'s late February or early April). Midsummer can fuck right off, it\\'s way too hot for bonfires. Afterwards, Thanksgiving and Yule all kind of lump together into harvest season depending on when the frost comes- I celebrate both in the traditional secular fashion. As to the gods, I obviously honor Eostre foremost on her own holiday, but every time I celebrate anything that \"big\" I offer to all the gods. For actual planting and harvest I tend to also give specifically to Thunor and Ing-Frea.', 'I\\'m not personally aware of any, no. That doesn\\'t mean there\\'s no such thing (and a lot of other reconstructionists, particularly traditions with an earlier \\'termination\\' than the Norse, draw a bit of their information from that period). Generally the idea is embracing the cultures that the faiths being reconstructed sprouted from and viewing them as a \"folk religion\" of sorts with an emphasis on the ethnic factors as part of the identity. Similarly to how Jews focus on, well, Judaism, as opposed to the earlier Semitic polytheism/henotheism.', 'He\\'s not wrong on the etymological front, though. Easter by all accounts,  as a word,  seems to derive from Eostre, which was an Anglo-Saxon (and likely german saxon, previously) deity. Doesn\\'t mean the actual festival is based on a germanic one- just the word. \\n Most languages other than German and English, though, call Easter by names derived from the Latin cognate of \"Pesach,\" which is Hebrew for \"Passover.\" Easter\\'s actual date obviously ties into passover, as the bible is pretty clear on. The name is just co-opted from a different source in a few countries.', \"I'm also horrible at following holidays myself. May Day, as you say, seems to be a sort of cobbled together lot of different stuff. Beltane, as named, means nothing much. Eostre allegedly had a rather lengthy festival period associated with her (since her name was tied to essentially the whole month of April) but not a lot of details are known on that, either, since Eostre is attested in about one surviving source. \\n Honestly though, personally, even as a reconstructionist I discard historical holidays. I don't live in England. The weather in Texas couldn't be more different- we plant at different times, we harvest at different times,  it never bloody rains and it never bloody snows.  I tend to just hold my ritual offerings (the bigger ones, that I reserve for 'holidays' or just certain times of year) in around our own local planting/harvest times. The former amounts to Eostre (though sometimes a late one), the latter equates to around Thanksgiving (which I spend with family, anyway) or Yule depending on the state of the crop.\", 'I wouldn\\'t delete it.

I kind of hate that term but it is the \"norm\" in our community. SO many adoptive parents do not understand how important it is to the children to have that link and are so quick to cut the birth family out of the kiddos lives. It has been proven that children who know from the start the truth (age appropriate details of course) and have a relationship with the BM & family (as long as it is healthy of course) grow up to be much more secure about their situation. \\n I myself am an adoptive parent of an almost 3 year old.

For now, in our case it is the safest thing for all of us (I do not want to give out those personal details but lets just say she was not very kind to him or herself during the pregnancy). I wish things were different for him, because I know he is going to have questions (as do we already). I just hope that we can raise him to be secure enough with himself and help him understand that even though everything that took place in utero was horrid (I will find better ways to describe it to him of course) that his BM did what she thought was best for him when she placed him for adoption at birth. We will try to make him realize that it took a very strong person to realize she could not give him what he needed and that she loved him enough to get help finding a healthy and happy home. Some day I know he will want to find her. And we have all of his original information to do so with. I just hope she has gotten herself healthy and is ready when that time comes. \\n We hope our next adoption goes somewhat similar to how your daughters is now.

I'm really happy for them, but that doesn't keeping me from feeling really damn lonely. I keep in touch with them, but it's sporadic, and it just isn't the same as having a group of people close by. \\n The secondary situation is that I've lost touch with my only close friend who didn't move because my boyfriend doesn't like him. When I'm feeling lonely I tend to feel angry at my BF for this, but he's never forbidden me from seeing my friend or anything. I just feel anxious about seeing him because I know how my BF feels about him, so I've chosen to limit contact. I know this is my choice, but I can't help but feel resentful sometimes that it's a choice I've had to make. However, I almost certainly dwell on this more than I would if I had other friends to fall back on. \\n I've tried to reach out to some of my less close friends and acquaintances, but have concluded there's probably a reason they're not as close. Plans are made and then broken, I am always initiating contact only to not having it reciprocated, people sound enthusiastic about getting together but nothing ever happens. It's really disappointing and discouraging. \\n I'm friendly with my boyfriend's friends, but it just doesn't feel the same. They seem to like me, but I feel like they would be just as happy if I wasn't there. I also don't feel comforatable confiding in them about, say, my relationship, because they were his friends first. Being in a relationship also makes it harder to make time to seek out new friendships on my own. \\n I've also tried going to a couple of MeetUp groups, but of course I don't know anyone there and so it's hard for me to get excited about going back. I know it takes time to develop friendships, but it's really hard to put up with the acquaintance stage when I'm trying to fill the place of some of the best friendships I've ever had. \\n My family lives really far away as well. I just feel isolated, and after nearly a year of this things don't seem to be getting better. I've thought about moving, but I just started a job that I love, and it's a huge leg up in my career so I need to stick with it for a while. \\n I tend toward depression and anxiety, and this has not helped at all. There really are a lot of good things going on in my life (job, loving BF, generally good health) but it just feels hollow.  I feel like I'm in a terrible loop--I feel down about not having friends, so I don't take great care of myself, so I feel worse and it's harder for me to get out there and make new friends. \\n My quality of life has definitely declined. I have at various points had a regular exercise routine, cooked for myself regularly, even meditated. But all those habits have fallen by the wayside, and my sleep has suffered as well. I've put on weight, and I just don't feel as well in general. Most days I feel like I'm just getting by, I feel raw and off balance. I manage to function and get through my days, but more days than not I feel anxious, irritable and/or depressed, even if I don't show it. \\n I'm seeing a counselor, but due to my work schedule I can only make an appointment every couple of weeks. It's not enough, and I just don't know what to do to pull myself out of this. I've always had problems with my mood, but they've rarely affected my life severely enough for me to seriously consider medication. It's always been mild to moderate, it comes and goes, and I'm pretty terrified of the medication side effects. But this has been a problem in one form or another for over a decade. This is just the latest iteration. If it wasn't the friend situation, it would probably be something else. \\n So, I don't know what I'm looking for here. Can anyone else identify? Any success making new friends? Would you recommend giving medication a try? Any tips for just breaking this cycle? Any words of advice, encouragement, or empathy will be deeply appreciated.\", \"I'm glad you've managed to stay healthy on your current diet, and hope you continue to do so. To toss some more anecdote on the pile, when I ate poorly in the past, I felt bad and wasn't very healthy. Now I eat lots of fruits, veggies, and grains, and feel great. Doctor confirms my excellent health. I spend $30-$50 a week on groceries, and rarely eat out. So, I can attest to the fact that it is completely possible to eat healthfully and frugally. If you want to stick solely to budgetary considerations, stop reading now. \\n That being said, I think that there are a lot of nutritional concepts that you're not taking into account. As to your points above:\\n>I've never seen any credible science that suggests that too many carbs, or too many fats, or too many whatever is harmful to health unless you know you have established allergies. \\n Carbohydrates provide the bulk of your body's energy, while both protein and fats are essential nutrients that perform important functions. I don't know if you can have too much, but your body does require a minimum level of each to perform properly. \\n These are not the only nutrients your body needs. Based on the fact that you take a multivitamin, I'm sure you're aware of this. However, while diets that include a lot a fruits and vegetables have been shown to result in lower blood pressure and a reduced risk of heart disease, there is NO evidence that shows that taking a supplement will do the same. Furthermore, the vitamins and minerals in whole foods are generally absorbed better than when they are in pill form, and fruits and vegetables contain additional micronutrients that can't be found in a multivitamin. \\n >I will agree with you that if you are NOT someone who has self-control and cannot moderate your calorie intake responsibly, then yes, you should eat 'healthy' because you will be eating lots of fiber that your body can't process for calories and will just pass through your system (read: less efficient food). \\n Fiber--not just for the weak-willed! There are two kinds of fiber, soluble and insoluble, both of which are found only in plants. Each has a different function, including preventing constipation, reducing cholesterol, and aiding in the absorbtion of nutrients within the lower digestive tract.\", \"I don't think either is acceptable, but male circumcision is not at all analagous to having the clitoris removed. It would be more like cutting off the entire head of the penis. \\n I don't agree with forcing circumcision on anyone, but the female version is generally  much  more brutal, and often takes place in unsanitary conditions and is inflicted on girls very much old enough to be conscious of what is going on.  It can include a range of procedures from piercing the genitals with pins to completely removing the inner and outer labia, and sewing the vaginal opening shut. \\n As such, I can understand why people are more outraged about it than about male circumcision.\", 'F/29/5\\'4\" [239lbs - 217lbs = 22lbs GW: 170, then 140] \\n After gradually losing about 10 lbs the first part of the year, I decided it was time to put some conscious effort into losing weight at the end of July. I was counting calories (1460 per day), and I\\'ve started riding my bike to and from work each day (about 7 miles). I quickly lost about 10 more lbs, and was feeling really proud of myself. But in the last couple of weeks my resolve seems to have evaporated. A couple of things are contributing to this I think. \\n Firstly, I\\'m having some calorie counting issues. As I expressed in an [earlier post]( when I\\'ve counted calories before I became obsessed with food. Sure enough, that was beginning to happen. I\\'ve been constantly thinking about what to eat, how much to eat, when I can eat next. \\n It\\'s better on structured, regular days, since I pack my own food and there\\'s not much in the way of temptation. The situations that really mess me up are eating out (how the heck do you figure out how many calories are in restaurant food?) and open-ended food situations, like parties where food is set out for grazing ([earlier related post]( In those cases I start off with good intentions, but at a certain point it\\'s like there\\'s no off switch. If there\\'s food in front of me, I\\'ll keep eating it. Unfortunately, there have been a number of these unstructured, open-ended situations recently. \\n And then there\\'s my mood. At first I felt great! Energetic, satiated, pleased with my new resolve. But after a few weeks I started feeling pretty anxious. This is not unprecedented for me, but it\\'s unpleasant nonetheless. Just really irritable feeling, mind racing, kind of generally unhappy. Maybe it started after I added exercise (too few calories?), or maybe it\\'s got to do with worrying about my weight in general. I certainly don\\'t want to go back to not thinking about it, but I don\\'t want to be miserable about it either. \\n I don\\'t know, can anyone relate? I want to get back on track, but I really hate how all-consuming losing weight feels sometimes. I don\\'t mind the actual things involved--eating less, exercising--I just hate spending so much of my time thinking about them. It is certainly easier to just check out mentally, but that\\'s how I got to where I am in the first place and I don\\'t want to go back. I want to be fit and healthy, to feel good about how I look, to have a sense of accomplishment... Any tips or advice you can offer would be much appreciated.', \"I don't see how someone could say uniformly that all depictions of women having sex are degrading, unless they believe that all sex is degrading to women.  That being said, I agree that much mainstream porn tends to objectify women and depict female sexuality unrealistically. But that's not to say that it isn't possible, and there is plenty of alternative porn (and erotica) that explore this territory.\", 'I disagree.  I think that the involvement of money in education has degraded the educational system.  Of course there are for-profit universities, which have people essentially buying degrees.  But even in legitimate institutions, I feel like the high price tag transforms students into customers, both in the eyes of the universities and even to the students themselves. \\n Universities of course want to keep their \"customers\" satisfied and to collect as much tuition as possible.  This leads to lowered admission standards and less rigorous instruction, which allows colleges to keep their retention numbers high while satisfying their clientele.  I\\'ve even observed this in students themselves, who display a sense of entitlement because they\\'re paying the professor\\'s salary. \\n The market is then saturated with degree-holders, rendering said degrees virtually meaningless and forcing people to pay for even higher-level degrees to stay competitive. \\n As things currently stand, anyone can get a degree if they have the money and/or connections.  Going to college is just what is done, whether or not you have the need or motivation, and once you\\'ve finished there\\'s the very real chance that you\\'ll find yourself bogged down with student loan and competing for menial jobs that shouldn\\'t require a degree but do anyway. \\n In a free system, clear-cut and rigorous entry standards would be what kept people engaged.  I think that the hard work that people put into qualifying for college would be enough of an incentive to keep them motivated. College shouldn\\'t be the default path for everyone, and hopefully if higher education was only pursued by people who were motivated and working toward some purpose, this would leave other jobs free to be filled by non-degree holders. \\n BTW, I think that in the proposed system skilled labor training should also be provided for free.']": "Based on the reddit posting history, the user is primarily interested in the following areas:\n\n1.

I play a lot of competitive games and do fitness on the side. \\n I've posted here aswell: \\n Which is where you can read the whole story. \\nI need some advice! I've never been in an actual relationship before (Aside from a ''funny'' one in elementary school, but doesn't really count.) and have never asked or been asked by someone. I'm quite introverted to strangers (But extroverted towards my friends, it's kind of weird like that.) Been in school with this girl for 3 years, and this is the first year I don't share any classes with her whatsoever, I basically only see her during some of the breaks we have. A couple weeks before summer I actually started paying attention and falling for this girl: She's really beautiful, kind of stands out, blabla you know the rest. \\n Anyway, I decided this was gonna be the first time I'm going to actually do something with these feelings. problem is, I don't know how to. It's not custom to take someone out to drink coffee here without knowing them first, but it's hard to get to know her at all if I don't share any classes anymore. In the time we did share classes we had some occasional very casual chatting and joking, but that's really it. I know she likes basketball and is on the club I used to be on, and I want to invite her to play basketball with me. Is that a good idea? I asked her once before through twitter but it wasn't very thought out. She was at a party that  night and said she couldn't go, to my ''Another time then?'' she replied ''Yes maybe'' :P Kind of vague. \\n I have 0 experience with talking to girls that I like and am not very confident in walking up to strangers in the first place. On top of that I have Aspergers and although it doesn't impact me too much in my daily life, it does sometimes cause a bit of confusion (Have a hard time grasping sarcasm sometimes as well as obvious tells) What should I do? \\n Hope you can help me, /r/teenagers! :D\", \"Hey /r/dating , thanks for reading.\\nI'll try to cut my story short.\\nI've always been a bit of a social mess. I'm ''diagnosed with Aspergers'' which means I should have difficulty in social situations, but still. To me, I've always been very extraverted towards my friends, but introverted to outsiders. This plus the fact that I have 0 experience with dating, or really the other gender at all, gives me a bit of a headache to say the least.\\nI'm 17 now, and I've shared classes with this girl for 2 years in High School. I'm in my final year now, and I share ZERO classes with her. Just my luck, because I started really liking her towards the end of last year, for no apparent reason.\\nBefore now I would've probably ignored these feelings but I've recently started losing a ton of weight (weighed in at about 97KG before, now I'm roughly 80.5 (213lbs to 177lbs), started putting a bit of gel in my hair, started using a bit of cologne, the regular stuff. I'd never really care before this point, but I do now for some reason.\\nSo anyhow, since I've recently started liking this girl, I actually want to go for it and give it a shot, and feel good about it. But I just have no idea how to handle it. I know it should be simple but I just don't feel it. I've talked to her before in the past 2 years, and we share the hobby of Basketball (well, I quit playing in a team 3 years ago, she joined after that, but I still do it a bit with friends sometimes.). We always made some jokes during lessons, and we got along well. I've always liked her, but not really ''fancy'' like I do now..

Much appreciated in advance!\", \"I didn't know if this was the 100% right place to post this, but if it's not, please redirect me to another subreddit.\\nI am currently in our last, ''exam year'' of high school and will be graduating after this year. In the past I've always been very introverted and since 2-3 years ago I've been trying to be more outgoing while still keeping ''true'' to my hobbies: Playing and competing in games. I've also been going to the gym since about a year and considering I was kind of overweight, I've lost ~14 KG(30 pounds) through cardio and lately a lot of resistance training. I regularly put gel in my hair now and take good care of myself. Don't do as many /caring allnighters and try to be awake at times in school (not necessarily for the fact that it's so important or necessary but more for the fact of not looking like the lazy, always tired, gross guy. In other words, in the last couple of years, a LOT of improvement to my character and physique. I'm diagnosed with Syndrome of Aspergers, which is not actually affecting me too much in my daily life (I think), except in social situations I'm not used to (non good friends, big parties, etc.) My one big problem: In my entire life, I've never had an actual relationship with a girl. Yes, I'm very young, but now that I actually want to act upon interests in girls I want to go for it, experience it, and try get a relationship. That doesn't help when I don't even know how to approach her (Suppose that has to do with the Aspergers bit :/) \\n I'm currently almost obsessed (obviously just to me) over this girl in my school. I've been in her class for 2 years, except for this year, where we share ZERO classes. A pain in the ass. All those 2 years I've not really talked to her much, maybe a very small amount of just banter during gymnastics lessons (yes, we don't practice individual sports through school.) Only in the last couple months of last year I started really realizing how beautiful (I find anyway) she is and how she's mostly not like a lot of girls. She also practices basketball, a sport I used to practice about 5 years back. \\n So during the holidays I obviously didn't speak to her much. She lives about 20 minutes away from me anyway. I talked a bit with her through websites like Twitter (I barely do any social media, but suddenly I do a lot more of it. Funny how that works.) Nothing big though. That leaves me with a bit of an issue. I like a girl that I've ''known'' for multiple years but never really ''known'' her. I'm really interested her and have no idea how to handle it or make any moves in the right direction for me. I feel if I don't learn this, the ''dating'' game later on in my life will be a bit of a pain at all. I just want to skip to the ''good'' part :P I don't have any idea about her school roster about which classes she goes to, I just occasionally see her at school and that's it. She's always with friends, and obviously, as am I, so I have a really hard time knowing where and when I should go for something and strike up a conversation or something similar. \\n So\", \"Hey /r/relationship_advice, thanks for reading. \\n I'll try to cut my story short. \\n I've always been a bit of a social mess. I'm ''diagnosed with Aspergers'' which means I should have difficulty in social situations, but still. To me, I've always been very extraverted towards my friends, but introverted to outsiders. This plus the fact that I have 0 experience with dating, or really the other gender at all, gives me a bit of a headache to say the least. \\n I'm 17 now, and I've shared classes with this girl for 2 years in High School. I'm in my final year now, and I share  ZERO  classes with her. Just my luck, because I started really liking her towards the end of last year, for no apparent reason. \\n Before now I would've probably ignored these feelings but I've recently started losing a ton of weight (weighed in at about 97KG before, now I'm roughly 80.5 (213lbs to 177lbs), started putting a bit of gel in my hair, started using a bit of cologne, the regular stuff. \\nI'd never really care before this point, but I do now for some reason. \\n So anyhow, since I've recently started liking this girl, I actually want to go for it and give it a shot, and feel good about it. But I just have no idea how to handle it. I know it should be simple but I just don't feel it. I've talked to her before in the past 2 years, and we share the hobby of Basketball (well, I quit playing in a team 3 years ago, she joined after that, but I still do it a bit with friends sometimes.). We always made some jokes during lessons, and we got along well. I've always liked her, but not really ''fancy'' like I do now..

Tier I are life threatening diseases we have under control or almost eradicated thanks to vaccinations. Tier II are still life threatening but have a better survival rate. Tier III are harmful but preventable diseases. I have limited medical knowledge so I invite doctors, nurses, and epidemiologists to correct me on the specific diseases and where they should go. Public Health is different than individual health in that it takes longer for people to see results good or bad, but it relies on everyone working together for it to be successful. \\n Tier I are the nasty immediately life threatening diseases like pertussis in infants, MMR, polio, etc - essentially stuff that can kill your child easily. We are fortunate to live in countries (assuming most of us are from the US, UK, Canada, or Australia) where we don't encounter many outbreaks of these diseases anymore because most people vaccinate. Some people cannot handle the vaccines because of allergies or some other medical condition and need to rely on the rest of us to provide them with herd immunity. When people stop vaccinating, there are outbreaks and the most vulnerable are more likely to die. Preventing people from dying should be argument enough. \\n Tier II is where I'd put the flu shot, Hep B, chicken pox, rotavirus, etc. These are fairly survivable but can cause life threatening complications for infants and young children, the elderly, those with other conditions and pregnant women. Though the 'people die from these' argument isn't as strong as Tier I, herd immunity still saves lives and prevents hospitalizations for the most vulnerable. \\n Tier III are things like HPV. HPV isn't always a big deal but is very easy to precent through vaccination, thus reducing the likelihood of HPV becoming harmful in some cases. The HPV vaccine is needed for the same reason condoms are recommended for people not having monogamous sex with the same partner for a number of years. There's a good chance nothing will happen but the potential consequences are serious enough to take precautions. \\n A common argument against vaccination is asserting that one can build up their immune system. I agree, vaccines are a proven way to train your immune system to respond to disease. the best thing about it is you don't get sick. True, you may not feel well shortly after the shot, but, that's your immune system building up defenses. It's sort of like fire drills for your body.\", 'because the wish is to be a millionaire presently, and to be one presently you must have been one in the past \\n This is', \"My first drug experience was in 8th Grade on LSD in an amusement park. The park closed pre-peak and my father drove me home that night. I was mostly quiet on the ride because I didn't want to get caught and I was determining the genders of cars based on headlight shape. (Square = male, round = female.) Occasionally I'd get a glimpse of the corresponding genitalia emerging from the hoods of oncoming traffic. \\n When I got home, I made my second big mistake. (The first big one was taking a psychedelic with little regard for set or setting.) I went upstairs and took a shower. This is when the melting effect kicked in. I was convinced the water was dissolving the floor and back wall and I was about to fall out of the house. Luckily the entire shower stall - a small stand-up only type - became a shipping package and I was gently delivered to the back yard. upon landing all the walls of the shower/shipping package fell outwards and I was naked in the backyard. The shock of this jolted me back to the reality of the bathroom I was using and decided a proper shower could wait until morning. \\n I peaked after climbing in bed. My surroundings were mutating colorful geometric shapes with pulsing lights - most likely a composite of my experience at the amusement park. I boarded the small space shuttle/amusement park ride which was camouflaged to look like the colors of my hallucination.

I'm grateful that my wife and I worked on communication and conflict resolution skills with each other before we became parents. General discussion about major things is important, but, unless baby needs it in the first three months, you're better off making a decision once you get to know your child. Circumcision, day care, breastfeeding intentions, nursery set up, and co-sleeping go smoothest if you decide on what to do ahead of time. \\n Things like sleep training are better left to discuss when baby is in that stage. Any plan is going to be completely misinformed if you don't know baby's sleep patterns or temperament. Even if you do have a plan for some of the early stuff, it might change. We were planning on co-sleeping for the first 3 months and we got an Arm's Reach co-sleeper. On our son's first day home from the hospital, he always managed to get his face stuck in the corner of the sleeper so we never felt comfortable using it.

I\\'ve always liked traveling in the pre-dawn hours. Theres always this weird blank slate to the day and you are there to see it unfold from the very beginning. After we check into the maternity ward, we were shown to our room. My wife got changed into her gown and I into scrubs. Then we waited for the doctor. \\n My wife was brought to the operating room and I waited some more. I fiddled with my phone and waited. I paced around the room and waited. I tried meditating, I tried to watch TV, I waited some more. Eventually I was lead to the OR to meet my wife. She was very relaxed and couldn\\'t feel anything below her neck. We talked about how excited we were to become parents, exchanged I love you\\'s and sang along to the 60\\'s R & B Pandora station my wife picked (our wedding song was Soothe Me by Sam & Dave) as the soundtrack to our son\\'s birth. \\n The anesthesiologist, who was a tiny 50 year old woman (comically mismatched to my 290 lb 6\\'5\" stature), told me my son was about to be born and I was welcome to look over the curtain. She warned that if I felt at all grossed out by what I saw I should sit back down because she wouldn\\'t be able to catch me if I fainted. Of course I had to look. In contrast to the loving and relaxed nature on our side of the curtain the birthing team was intense. The lead nurse was dropping elbows on my wife\\'s abdomen to simulate pushing while the OB and other nurses were getting ready to extract the baby from the open hole at the bottom of my wife\\'s belly. The OB shouted, \"He\\'s coming, he\\'s coming!\" and there was a general clamor. Once our son emerged, everyone in the OR let out a simultaneous gasp. Our son was born and he appeared to be as healthy as any newborn is expected to be. \\n The head nurse cleaned off some of the blood and vernix off of my son and placed him on my wife\\'s now bare chest. He rooted around for a little bit and I put my hand on his back. The whole procedure was so uneventful my wife and I were able to really take in our first minutes with our son. The nurses took pictures of the three of us with my phone and I got to hold him while they transferred my wife back to her hospital bed. The only thing she didn\\'t like about the hour long experience was that she was unable to immediately hold our son due to the nerve block in her spine. \\n We spent the rest of the week in the hospital. My wife recovered from surgery while I took the lead in baby care. After it really hit me that I was a father, all the things I learned in the parenting classes was completely forgotten. It was a relief to have the nurses there to assist and train me on basic baby care procedures. They also reassured us that everything was fine whenever the new parent jitters got to us. \"Yes, that\\'s normal,\" was a popular refrain. The extended post-op recovery period was a nice way to transition into being parents. When we got home we felt more prepared than parents who only spent 24 hours in the hospital after a vaginal birth. \\n Over the next four days, I would occasionally take my son for walks around the maternity ward to allow my wife to rest for a little bit.

I\\'ll do my best to pass my knowledge on to you, because I obsess over this shit. \\n You\\'re looking at the wrong part of your rig. That sound has almost nothing to do with electronics, it\\'s 99% about your strings and the way you attack them. \\n The first step is to get new strings, and replace them regularly as they lose brightness. You also might want to use a slightly lighter gauge, but the most important part is learning to pluck hard. \\n The click noise comes from the strings hitting your frets as they begin to vibrate. So the technique you must learn is to pick hard enough to make that happen. Personally, I hit the string from the top, from fairly far away from the body. I also make sure to get the string under the meat of my fingers, and pluck through it rather than past it or by it. [Check out this Bryan Beller video to see what I mean.]( It\\'s all about strength and power, and it takes some getting used to, especially at speed. \\n On that note, the next most important piece of the puzzle is your strings. First, as I said earlier, get new ones. Strings lose treble as they age, so keeping them new is essential. While you\\'re at it, you might want to get a slightly lighter set than usual, especially at first. As I said, you need to hit hard, which is difficult if you lack strength and endurance. Lighter strings are easier to pluck the necessary amount to hit the frets since the bend a little more easily. \\n One last string related thing: check your action. You probably want it relatively low, for the sake of easy playing at speed, and so the string hits the frets easily. Don\\'t set it too low, though, or you\\'ll get fret buzz, and fret buzz is a bitch. \\n Now then: Electronics. First of all, you don\\'t need to buy any new effects, pedals, PODs, or amps to get the Death Metal tone. Like I said, almost all of the sound is in your fingers and your playing style. As long as you are picking hard enough to hit the string on the frets, you\\'re pretty much good. That said, your amplifier\\'s tone needs to be tailored to properly augment and accentuate your playing style. Equalization should focus on, or at least accentuate, the click. The click lives in the mids and treble. \\n There are two schools of thought to metal bass EQ; Scoop and Mids. Scoop means you cut (\"Scoop out\") your midrange and boost your treble and bass. This way, you get the treble click and the lower rumble of your fundamental, with not many overtones. This sounds killer on its own, but personally I don\\'t use this EQ form, for the same reason many others don\\'t: it doesn\\'t sit well in a mix or a band situation. Your lows will clash with the bass drum, your highs with the cymbals, snare, and guitars. The end result is that you won\\'t be able to hear yourself, and nobody else will either. The video you linked is of my all-time favorite bassist, AJ Lewandowski.  Here\\'s a screen shot of his amp modeler\\'s settings , that he actually uses relatively little bass and cuts his treble. All of the clicky sound in his tone comes from his mids, which he has boosted. The frequency of his mids also puts the focus in the higher part of the midrange. This is how my EQ is too. Mostly high mids, for maximum Death Metal click while still being able to be heard in a band.

The kiss was fabulous, and led to a good relationship.', \"Focus on each instrument's individual tonality and how you can adjust it to sound heavy on its own terms, both hardware-wise and technique-wise, and in a way that serves the ensemble. \\n Let me elaborate... \\n Each player, much as any musician, be they in an orchestra, jazz combo, needs to individually build their tone, intonation, fluency, and dynamics. Analyze how you pick, for example. You use the Devin Townsend method of scraping. The big draw of this is the tone. It sounds heavy as hell. But how precise is it? Can you keep time and definition between notes? How easy is it to accent notes? Change muting? A drummer might think similarly about their stick technique, or a bassist their finger attack. \\n I think the technique aspects that are most often overlooked in Metal are fluency and dynamics. The weird thing is, they're not  really  overlooked, they're just thought about in one and exactly one way- loudly. Drummers are encouraged to hit hard, guitarists and bassists to hit hard. While this can indeed make music sound heavy, it's not best to do it all the time. Music naturally climaxes and rises and falls with good songwriting. If you're on 10 all the time it stops doing that. Not just with the dynamics of chunks of chunks of songs, but within riffs. Professional musicians gt this. A good example is  this , listen to what they say about muting and the Nile Pulse. They deliberately pulse every 8 notes. They mute sections more or less depending on how hey need to sound. They don't dig in CONSTANTLY. This is what makes all music have feeling, what makes it sound as if it were played by humans. Variation. Mastering and locking in variation with yourself and your band makes you more consistent, coherent, and, in the end heavier. Make sure you're clean, that you can hear every note, that it sounds good, and that all the dynamics and accents, loud and soft, come through. Make sure you can hear everything, so everything adds to the music's impact. \\n With your equipment, which should always come second, the sound of the band can truly be locked in. Use complimentary equalization- dial down frequencies the bass is dialing up. If a bass drum gets buried in the mix, but sounds fine on its own, eq around it. MAKE SURE YOU CAN HEAR EVERYTHING, so everything adds to the music's impact.\", 'The mods have discussed this, and there are a few reasons we didn\\'t remove them.

God I must have looked like such a creep walking around today. \\n Please, if you happen to be in Richmond Hill, Ontario by Crosby Park, let me know if you see it :( There is and will be a reward involved as well.\", 'I hand fed my babies today for the first time. i almost giggled when they finally trusted my foreign hand enough to go crazy for the new uncooked seafood i got them. \\n i first tried the squid, it was definitely too tough for their little mouths to break off big enough pieces. hmm i guess ill keep that until they are a bit bigger. \\n muscles, a bit more luck this time, they ate like half of one and then left it. vacuuming and scooping with a net ensued. \\n shrimp. this. the shriiiimp, the winner out of the bag! this was the only part of the \"seafood medley\" i have found that kept their appetites through the whole meal. mind you i dont give them the whole thing as they are still very small, and after the first few bites you can see their bellies rounding out. \\n right now my puffers are about 2 inches in length. i think the squid was just too rubbery. the muscles? i have no idea, not their flavour of the month i guess for right now. i have seen videos of some puffers going nuts for these two foods, and one video in particular where a gsp managed to literally vacuum up a long strip of squid no problem (although was a bit bigger than my fish). \\n i have never really gotten them this kind of food before because at first i was not sure about feeding them food meant for our meals. further researched showed that many people liked to do this and apparently so did their fish. i mostly started out with flake (meh), and bloodworms. in between that and getting the seafood, i tried out ghost shrimp, mystery snails and the tiniest hermit crabs i have ever seen. tbh, no clue where the hermits are and that worrys me because i dont see remnants anywhere (they are literally that small, also the colour of my gravel probably doesnt help). the ghost shrimp were dissapointing as they are all still alive. is it just that they cant see them? theyre being like cats that just watch a mouse scurry across the floor. i catch the shrimp actually cleaning my puffers when they are low enough to the ground. wtf? lol. \\n the snails are a given, they are no longer with us. i help my puffer because of the size of the snails and crack the shells. should i be helping them out, or let them figure it out? i think theyre starting to get it though, the last snail i had was not able to fully close itself in because of the damage done by puffer teeth. \\n another question, i see people hand trimming their puffers teeth. would the snails or anything with a hard shell not be enough? \\n Thanks', 'Purchased on thursday, dead today (laate sunday)? \\n i have to say, the initial experience was awesome. never got any dry hits, and man did it produce some good results in my books. it only has a single hole punched but it is considerably large. i put it into my smoktech tank from happyvaper (Ontario, Canada), and let her rip for the weekend on 4.7v all day, everyday. i read the horror stories of duds everywhere and for some reason i took the risk of purchasing just a single cartomizer. needless to say i had my fingers crossed the night before. \\n day 1 , i was vaping like a mad man. great flavours, and plumes of vaper that got people interested into trying my boosted ego-c. \\n day 2 , going strong, same results.\\n day 3 , too happy to notice anything lol.\\n day 4 , sitting at my desk, redditing, researching. why? it felt like all of a sudden a wall was presented in front of me. \\n throat hit and flavour was diminishing and i caught myself vaping more to find it. curiosity struck me, and i went to run some hot water through the cartomizer in my sink. blew out whatever left over water i could, and let them dry for a bit. a long while later, i tried again. refilled my tank and re-primed the filler. keep in mind though that i am currently under the weather (chest is on fire, coughs, runny nose. you know, the fun package deal). i even tried hygienic methods such as brushing my teeth, rinsing with mouth wash, waiting a bit longer in between hits. im starting to lose my happy self from being free of analogs! then i realised that i had good flavour earlier so it couldnt be me (could it?). \\n im going to sleep on it. see if im just over vaping. is that even possible? i placed an order for an actual 5 pack of boges. not looking forward to how many duds i may get but still motivated to keep myself off analogs. i may get suggestions for other methods of vaping such as an atty so i also placed an order for one of those new pumpcartos that fit on top of an atty for a different way of dripping. i will also try the boiling method while i wait and maybe try some rubbing alcohol? \\n anyways, thought id throw my 2 cents in. i will update this post once i get the new cartos in, and do a review on the pumpcarto as well. i will also update when i wake up and start vaping again to see what i end up with. it may not sound like i know very much, but i really did learn a lot from this subreddit and am trying to apply my new found knowledge whenever i can. for now, i work the kitchen, boiling my carto.', 'Hello everyone, \\n so i tried the mesh wick setup in my bully (which i found out was a clone) with it in a vertical position like a gensis:  .\\nin this, a real bully is shown (as seen by the flat top as opposed to slanted). inside you can see that the posts are made of all metal. with mine, the clone, further down is plastic of some sort. \\n when i tried the genisis way illustrated in the link, i accidentally allowed the mesh to tilt and left it that way. when test firing i found failure, but when i went to remove it this time i found the mesh actually became attached to the plastic. i had to rip it off. no residual mesh was left on but needless to say i was concerned. \\n Please everyone, if you bought a bully and are not sure if its real, please look inside to see if you have the plastic at the bottom portions of the posts. they will melt from the heat and cause the mesh to become stuck. who knows if i breathed in fumes from the plastic, but making this post seemed necessary still. \\n I have been aiming for 2.5-2.8ohms every build and trying to run it at 4.7-5v. it is fine now since ive stumbled upon this issue, for this style of setup. next time i am just going to roll a skinnier wick to make it easier to rebuild. this wick was a little bit on the fat side because of the amount of times i had to wrap in order to achieve my goal resistance. or i was thinking of shoving a piece of silica wick in between the mesh and post on one side then wrapping around to the other side too. thoughts? \\n also, i came across a video about someone double wicking the mesh where they utilize the hole down the centre and sliding a very tiny mesh wick into it. i honestly think it works but it may just be me? you guys should try it if you have nothing else to do! and then tell me if im just dreaming or not. i guess it replaces silica rolled inside mesh. \\n Heres the results:', \"First off, pics soon, i cant find my USB cable. how convenient. \\n so as a late present, and also a kick to my own ass (dont know why i didnt think of getting him a planted tank sooner), i got my father a 10g glass tank with florescent lighting. enough lighting with a shallow tank to house easy care level plants. i cycled the tank hidden in my sisters room (im so sneaky), starting with the tetra filter it came with, 9-10g of seachem conditioned water, and black flourite gravel. once the tank was cycled i vacc'ed out the majority of the water, moved the tank into his room with ninja skills (he was out at the time), and then refilled with the SAME water. i also had to do a LOT of small water changes because for some reason all the warnings to the substrates unrinsed cloudiness flew passed my clueless mind. it basically looked like a massive bacteria bloom in there. \\n PLAANTS!! \\n java fern, anubias barteri, crypt parva, bronze wendtti, crinum (thaianum?), hygrophilia siamensis. for some reason my lfs did not have marimo balls, java moss or hornwort. \\n temp is being kept at around 70 degrees, params are stabilized, and still no fish (probably not going to be any for a while). \\n now, my father is the green thumb of the family, all over the house are spider plants, orchids (a few different kinds), and randomly a pot of rosemary. over the years hes built and operated his own greenhouse and was able to grow plants worth selling at his old business. the question is, will he be able to apply a lot of his knowledge to non-aquarium plants to these in his new 10 gallon? i waited for him to decide what to do with placement and such so i left the plants spread out still in their pots. he said that there is no need to remove them until the roots have occupied enough space in there first, so that when he finally tears the pots off, there will be a well established root system. my only worry is that, itll be well established in this tiny pot? \\n im more worried about the plants that people say to anchor down to rocks or driftwood like the anubias or fern. dont worry, i warned him about which plants will become a rottfest if placed directly into the substrate. \\n so what say you reddit? do you think his first tank will be successful or do you think he is in a new world now and needs to go to back to almost basics? i just dont want him to assume anything because of his experience outside of an aquarium. hes never had live plants underwater. his only experience with fish are the two ponds we had (indoor and outdoor), some weird wall hanging tanks he made for me and my sister's early years betta experiences. \\n thanks reddit!\", 'Today was the day that I was to take flight outside in a very open area for the first time. Straying away from my usual spot, the driveway/living room, I was already dreading what could happen from my current inability to fly well. \"Hey.. Flyaways!\" kept scrolling across the front of my mind, almost as if they were floating around my head to come back into view again as a constant reminder. No worries though, my TP-Link antenna arrived from Amazon before leaving the house, so that was immediately installed. \\n I set off soon after, feeling a bit more confident with the new found range, and headed towards the empty baseball diamond. I brought 3 spare lipos with me (650mah), and the fun began. 10km/h gusts proved to be a struggle for the light quad, but still I chose to rise with the wind and gain altitude. Higher and higher I went, soaring above the stadium lights until one rogue wind took it like a sail. I quickly went into recovery mode in my mind. I stopped any controls and maintained a hover as best as I could in order to see which way was forward... Oh god. I played with it too much, a little forward pitch and she took off even further away. I felt a little sick at this point while trying to keep calm. Gone. Can\\'t see it any longer, but recovery mode was still in action. I quickly narrowed down key land marks, a Rogers communication tower was on the other side so I packed my stuff and started walking in that general direction. I wandered through 3 or 4 blocks looking like a creep with the way I was looking around at peoples properties from the sidewalk. I then had an idea, I will attempt to arm the quad with my tx again. It was my only hope. Luckily, I didn\\'t have to look like a complete moron as I could keep the tx in my laptop bag and still bind the quad while walking around aimlessly (but probably not from very far, I got VERY lucky here). Then, I heard it. A sound that was so welcoming that it almost brought a tear to my eye - props smacking tree branches as I applied a small amount of throttle repeatedly. To add to my returning luck, it was a leafless tree still, so it was easy to spot once it was heard! I then went up to the house on the property and knocked on the door to be presented with no answer. Hope was fading again. \"No!\" I said, and I turned to face the houses across the street and notice some folks renovating.. and I saw 2x4\\'s. I asked one of the workers as politely as I could if they had anything that was long enough to poke something out of a tree. Of course, none of them spoke English, so I pointed at my tx, then pointed at the tree, and then let him hear the cries of one free prop and 2 others smacking into branches. He laughed and then seemed to understand. He managed to say though, \"I give you something better!\". He waved me inside the house that was under construction, and came out with a couple 2x4\\'s. He walked them over to the tree, and screwed the two boards together and said, \"hah! Now you catch\". With him smacking branches and me feathering the throttle, it came down and I caught it with one hand. It was perfect. He then quickly detached the 2x4\\'s, said \"good day\" and walked back to work. Then in my mind I heard, \"Theeeeere gooes my heeroooo..\" as his back turned to me (haha) and I proceeded to walk home. \\n I always seem to find myself with not the best thoughts of people, but moments like today bring the light crashing back into my mind and heart. Not sure if this is just a selfish feeling, as this situation was about me, and the fact that something bad happening did not succeed.

How much depends on what your goals are. \\n For example, if you just want to level to 100 and be able to buy flying or enchants and stuff for your character, then I would recommend setting aside a small nest egg of gold (up to you really). \\n However, I'm going to try to capitalize on the new markets made available in the expansion with professions. Each expansion, so far, has seen a revamp of the various professions. What this means is that there are new basic mats for each expansion. New ore to prospect, new cloth, etc. \\n This means that the only thing you CAN stockpile is gold. I won't necessarily be going for server first achievements or anything. I just want to have enough gold to buy the new crafting mats to get my professions to max level relatively quickly. From there, if I'm among the first people to max a given profession, the gold making potential is enormous. \\n Remember how Golden Lotus were selling for 500-1000g during the first week of MoP? That will be me buying the equivalent for WoD so that I can supply the first raiders with their gems/enchants/inscriptions...whatever and make a killing. I plan on saving 200-300k gold for the start of WoD.\", \"Greetings fellow summoners! I'm here today to discuss the new Black Cleaver, and it's implications for your friendly ADC. While the rest of you were slobbering over the new and shiny Hurricane, I was making  le sexy eyes  at the new BC. Let me explain why I think this item is a far more tantalizing prospect for  most  ADC champions. \\n My largest, problem with Hurricane is positioning. Most of my time spent in a team fight, as an ADC, is on the outskirts firing away at the front line of the enemy team. Many times, a pesky Jax or Irelia will find their way past our tanks, at which point I'm left to kite them around and hopefully kill them in order to re-enter the fight. My point is this: I have serious doubts about how many of my AA's will be proccing Hurricane and hitting another target or  maybe  two in a realistic team fight. \\n Generally, my goal is to kill the highest priority target I can attack safely from a distance. This usually ends up being a bruiser or tank. Sometimes I can get an out of position carry or support, but the fact remains that the ADC has to go through a tank before the rest of the team in most cases. \\n So this brings us to the new Black Cleaver, and what I think will make ADC's overpowered. If one were to combine this with Last Whisper, and maybe some armor penetration runes, they could basically treat any person on the other team as a squishy. Let's take a look. \\n Warning: math \\n Flat armor pen: 15 (BC) + 6 (masteries) + 25 (runes) = 46 \\n Pecent armor pen: 30% (full stack BC) + 35% (LW) + 8% (masteries) = 73% \\n So, you're telling me I can ignore 73% of their armor AND have an additional 46 flat armor pen on top of that?  Mother of god   sunglasses \\n So what to those values mean for us? Remember that in s3, percentage armor pen will be calculated  before  flat apen. If you do the math, that means that a target with 170 armor will be reduced to  0 ARMOR .  What about the really tanky people? 300 armor target =  35 armor . \\n So you will basically be treating that late game Malphite like a level 1 Ashe, just with a lot of health. How is this not drawing more attention? Did I miss a post or something?

But I had my money from my bonus burning a hole in my pocket, and yesterday, I was on a mission. That mission may now lead me to hauling the sewing machine out of the shed. Here's the tale: \\n I am going on vacation next month and have been in need of a swimsuit top. I lost a lot of weight two years ago; I lost even more weight since the last time I bought swimwear, so I have some swim bottoms, but the top was pretty much falling off me. I wanted a tankini top that didn't have molded cups that were way too small. You all know how it is when you're trying to shop for swimsuits in most brick-and-mortar stores. \\n After visits to several stores in the small college town where I do my offline shopping, I found  this  last night. This is a tankini that you can wear as a halter or as strapless, as the straps can be tied behind your back. \\n Now, I usually fit into a 34G. The size range available in this top in cup size/band size, but you know they're not going to have 34G. I narrowed it down between 38D and 40D, and I picked up the 38D just because the cups were gapping in the 40D, and I could maybe deal with the 38D being so unsupportive, despite being molded, bra-shaped, and underwired. \\n I wore the new swimsuit top as I worked out in the yard to work on a base tan for vacation. I came to the conclusion that the tankini needs to be more closely fitted so that it stays up better. I am going on vacation with women I work with, and I'm sure they're not going to be that excited to see so much cleavage and side boob. I mean, yes, we'll all be in swimsuits, so we're all going to see a lot more of one another's bodies, true, but I feel like I'm half hanging out of this thing. \\n I could probably take in the sides to tailor it, but I don't know how swimsuit material is going to react to sewing. \\n Soooo long story short, has anyone ever altered a swimsuit top with any kind of success or failure? I must note that I am quite an amateur seamstress, mostly sewing by hand when I do sew. The last time I used a proper sewing machine, Miley Cyrus had not yet been born. I really like this top and think I can make it work. I almost wish I'd gone with an online retailer, but the money's been spent, so it's too late now. I am having a make it work moment and would appreciate tips, feedback, bad stories, a wake-up call that I've irretrievably screwed up, or pictures of cute llamas and alpacas.\", 'About four years ago, a group of Redditors decided to change their lives at /r/90daysgoal.

In the anime, we can see half the moon, and the rest in little pieces of space debris around it. \\n The moon is actually very important to our current existence.

Google the numbers yourself, because I don\\'t have them on the top of my head. \\n Now Imagine a top. You spin it and at first it revolves and is very uniform and balanced. As it continues to spin, it will wobble while it spins. As we keep going, the wobbles get larger and larger. The earth is that top. As the earth revolves around its axis, it also wobbles. If you can imagine, a straight line that cuts through the earth straight, the earth actually rotates on another axis that is 23.5 degrees tilted from the perfectly straight axis. It takes 26000 years to spin around the central axis and we decided to split them into 13 sections of 2000 years according to the zodiacs. Side note: This is why you don\\'t trust zodiacs. Procession has changed the sky from when the zodiacs were made. Also, there should really be 13 zodiacs. So why are we talking procession? It\\'s because the moon is tied to procession. The moon right now acts as an important gear in the system of our planetary motion. \\n I consulted my prof and he said that if the moon were to be destroyed, procession would be thrown off so hard that the 26000 year term for one cycle of procession would happen so fast that 6-8 magnitude earth quakes would become very common and basically kill all life on earth. \\n All in all, it\\'s an anime.

Crackfics and straight retellings of canon abound, but rationalfics are unique in that they have an implied requirement to improve on the source material. The rational fanfiction (ratfic?) writer looks at the source material and says to themselves \"I like this, but I would like it more if it was more like  this .\" \\n Which brings us to the discussion: \\n > [/u/eaturbrainz] eh-hem. Real-world heuristics for instrumental rationality are not  actually  instrumental rationality. If you find yourself in a universe with Spiral Power, going beyond the impossible and kicking logic to the curb  is the strictly rational move . You cannot rationalfic Gurren Lagann because there are no errors in reasoning to fix, whatsoever: they\\'re doing the right things the whole time because  their universe really does run on awesomesauce . \\n It\\'s not just  Gurren Lagann  which falls victim to this;  Fullmetal Alchemist  ( Brotherhood  or the original manga, not the first anime run) is mis-re-interpeted on this subreddit too. I can see why it makes an attractive candidate: it has a great plot with many twists and characters and some cool, albeit limited, use of real chemistry.  But if you try to make  Fullmetal Alchemist  more rational by injecting more complex chemistry into the fight scenes, you have totally missed the point. \\n Fullmetal Alchemist  is not about solving problems through the power of  family  molecular bonds.  Fullmetal Alchemist  is about  grief . It is about  redemption . The most significant plot devices such as Philosopher\\'s Stones or Human Transmutation have jack-all to do with real-world physics. \\n A fictional work can be divided into two parts: the  plot  and the  story . The plot is the actual sequence of events. The story is the emotional foundation running in parallel. Together they form the narrative. Good writers recognize this, and keep these two parts properly synchronized. Think of your favorite story, like, say,  Worm . When you\\'re remembering your favorite part, you\\'re really remembering the  story , not the  plot . You have to think harder and further past the general happiness to realize why it makes you have such a fond recollection. This is why a work of literature can endure for centuries even though precious little actually occurs in the book, and why the most explosive action film can be forgotten a few hours after you leave the theater. \\n This is why adding more chemistry to  Fullmetal Alchemist  is such a grave mistake: the plot gains little, and the story even less. If you want to write a rational fanfiction, you have to understand the Real Issues at the heart of the original, and work from there. \\n Quick question: How much has Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres learned about magic since the start of HPMOR?  Not that much . There\\'s one quick theorycrafting session about Atlantis and sufficiently advanced technology and that\\'s all. It\\'s still a fantastic story of course,  because the magic doesn\\'t actually matter . Unlike  Ra , HPMOR does not trip over its own magic system. A \"plausible\" hypothesis is tossed to the audience like a bone and Eliezer gets on with the actual plot, confronting the  Actual Problem . \\n That  is what rational fiction is about (to me anyway). Looking past Good and Evil and saying: What is the Real Problem here? What,  when you get down to it , is causing all of this trouble? \\n Writing a rational fanfiction is writing the N+1 draft of that work. You have the entirety of the source material laid out in front of you all at once, an advantage the original author could only dream of. You must consider the theme, that raw red thread deep inside it. You must find it and refine it, extracting every drop of potential. \\n Weaver Nine  is held up as a more rational version of  Worm , but I don\\'t quite agree. It\\'s excellent, and certainly more munchikin, but not what I think a Rational! Worm  would really be. By Eliezer\\'s definition, Taylor Herbert is already a Level-3 Intelligent character. Making her magically smarter doesn\\'t improve the  story , because  Worm  isn\\'t just about physical violence, no matter how smart. It\\'s about  teamwork , and  coordination Problems , and  social isolation  and what people do when there are no good choices. The story exists to study those problems, not play Who Would Win.', 'The fact that Dystopias exist proves we are pretty content with today\\'s society, or else we wouldn\\'t fantasize it being all screwed up. \\n > What can we, as YA writers, learn and use from this book(s)? \\n * Recommended Reading \\n A good dystopia is a functional society with many and varied problems. It is imperative that the society is  functional , or the reader will never become sufficiently immersed to want to solve the world\\'s problems right alongside the protagonist. For me, this was why the Divergent series couldn\\'t hold my attention - any society that horridbly designed would have fallen apart by the second generation, and no amount of Dark Age information-loss could lead a people to build one like that from scratch. \\n The goal of a Dystopia is usually right inside it: Fix The World. This is not always the case, generally is. It often annoys me when a book leaves lots of important loose ends lying around after resolving it\\'s plot (sure, you defeated the villain, but your happy ending will last all of two weeks because you forgot to fix the  real  issues that allowed the villain to come to power in the first place). That said, reform is not a terribly exciting topic, and while it can have interesting political complications it\\'s very difficult to keep a reader engaged through the bearacratic slog and reconstruction. \\n Alright, I\\'m done babbling. What can we learn? Well... \\n \\n The World Must Need Urgent And Massive Changes - the world should have a lot of problems, big and small, filled with people whose traits and qualities prevent them from truly saving the world from itself. More importantly, the reader must be convinced of the  necessity  of these changes ASAP, and also convinced of why the situation has not changed sooner. \\n \\n The Protagonist Is A Force For Change - Be it genetics, a cosmic accident, or pure blind luck, something occurs which allows the Protagonist to become the problem-solving engine the your world so desperately needs. Also, they need to solve all of the problems. The Hunger Games series did it best in recent memory. \\n \\n The Night Is Dark And Full Of Terrors - The world is not safe. The protagonist should never believe that they are truly safe, or this is not a true dystopia. There can certainly be people who are safe, but this flaw makes them intelligible as a protagonist. There are things to be feared in the world, and for good reasons that are speedily demonstrated to the reader. However, I don\\'t consider it wise to do so with an expendable character, since the only thing  that  demonstrates is that the real characters are too important to hurt. \\n \\n There Is History, And It Is Written In BLOOD - It is verry important that there be a reason (or better yet, a series of reasons) for it to be this way. I mentioned this while I was talking about Divergent earlier. It is not enough to say \"In a world where...\" or you end up with silly things like Elysium (don\\'t get me started on that one). The world is a character, the third most important one next to your hero and your villain, so don\\'t neglect your world-building! Lots of people take that advice to have more far-away lands with stupidly spelled names like Rhim\\'c\u00e6hl\u00f6k when those places are just as flat as any trashy, throwaway side character. Side characters can make or break a story, and the same applies to your locations.', \"So I was outlining a book and in setting up the backstory I realized it could very easily become its own book.

The 'acting' is that detailed. \\n As far as improv goes, a little goes a long way, but a lot goes a really long way. Slight changes to your eyebrows, shoulders or a tilt of the head can suggest many different things. Sweeping gestures can be very evocative but also very annoying -- use with discretion. \\n I'm sure there's a dragon's wealth of acting tutorials for free online. The only real difference with improv is that the script comes out of your head (or ass). \\n Don't be afraid to get meta; a disorganized character might not have his character notes in all the right places.

You grab opposite ends of the gum and pull in their respective directions until the piece stretches so thin that it tears.

Any grouping of three points describes a plane, which is why a four-legged stool can wobble but a three-legged stool never will (might not be level with the floor, but it won't wobble). \\n To define a 3D tear, you need four different points. Gum would never tear this way because the weakest segment will separate and we are back to three points, but I will continue. We now have a four-sided portal, tetrahedral in shape (Shape? I guess it's a shape). If you go to six sides you get a hypercube aka [tesseract]( but that way lays madness. The point is that this portal does indeed have points A, B, C, and D, and that is precisely the problem. The portal has become it's own obstacle, because every entrance is also a valid exit  at the same time.  You cannot leave without other spacebent versions of yourself doing the same thing though the other exits, even though you cannot perceive this occurring.\", 'This doesn\\'t go into any detail whatsoever.

One day this pond will dry up.  In that day, you\\'ll need to be a frog like me if you want to live.  Tadpoles like you can\\'t live in a dried-out pond.\" \\n I suppose you can look at it as the mother frog\\'s  extorting  her tadpoles--eat or die.  Grow into mature frogs or die. \\n To me, that\\'s what the human choice is, too.  EDIT:  Clarity...I\\'m not sure this makes sense.  What I meant is that the human choice is like the choice being presented to the tadpoles, eat so you can become strong healthy frogs like me.  It  is  essentially \"eat or die\", but not because death is a vicious retribution for not eating. \\n We live in a universe in which everything changes.  Everything is in a process of becoming something else, moving from one state or condition to another, or from one location relative to another.  Since we live in that kind of universe, we\\'re changing,  too . \\n What Christians believe is that one day God will make a new heavens and new earth.  Maybe God is  making  a new heavens and a new earth.  (It would certainly look \"new\" to someone who\\'d been conscious of the last 2 or 3 billions year and was capable of comparing  that  heavens and earth to the one he would be confronted with today.  But that\\'s not what Christians really mean, I don\\'t think.) \\n This is analogous, in my example, of the pond becoming dry land.  The frogs that ate the natural food that made them stronger and enabled them to develop into frogs are analogous to the humans who eat the  super natural food in order that we might become [what I would call]  truly human ...human in its completeness, as God intends and wants it to be. \\n Conversely, some of the tadpoles maybe didn\\'t eat well, or maybe at the wrong things.  Their bodies can\\'t develop strong arms, strong legs, or strong lungs.  When the pond dries up, they\\'ll die. \\n But suppose that the tadpoles, whether they were tadpoles or whether they were frogs when the pond dried up...suppose the tadpoles were immortal.  That none of them died. \\n So some of the tadpoles, the ones who had become frogs were happy as, well,  frogs , and the tadpoles are experiencing something very much like hell. \\n But in each case, the tadpoles that became frogs and the tadpoles who didn\\'t became what they were to become through their own choices. \\n So that the tadpoles who now must suffer at the bottom of a dry pond aren\\'t exactly being  punished --as if the punishment was something arbitrarily meted out for non-compliance--but are suffering a  consequence  of their  choice . \\n Now you will say that belief isn\\'t a choice.  But surely belief  in  someone is a choice.  That is to say, you really can choose whether you will believe  in  your father, your mother, your husband, your wife--whether you will trust them to love you and nourish you and give you what you need. \\n God will give us that Spiritual Food and that Spiritual Drink by which we can develop from tadpoles to frogs. \\n But you will say, \"How can I believe  in  someone if I don\\'t have any evidence that they even  exist ?\" \\n Well, when the rich young man asked Jesus, \"What must I do to inherit eternal life,\" Jesus answered, \"Keep the Commandments\".  So maybe start there.  Can\\'t hurt, anyway, right?', 'The first chapter of Luke\\'s Gospel tells us that, \"In the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee named Nazareth, to a virgin betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin\u2019s name was Mary.\" \\n So Mary has been introduced to us by Luke as \"a virgin\" (Gk.  parthenos ) who is  already  at the time we\\'re introduced to her  espoused / betrothed / pledged  (depending on your translation) to a \"man whose name was Joseph\". \\n That\\'s verse 27. \\n And the angel tells her (verse 31), \"You will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus.\" \\n Mary\\'s response is  troubling , to say the least. \\n >How can this be? \\n At this point in Luke\\'s narrative, there hasn\\'t been any mention of what we might call \"the miraculous\".  All Gabriel told her was she \"would conceive and bear a son\". \\n Was Mary unaware that she was betrothed to Joseph? \\n OR , perhaps there was some question with regard to sexual relations in the marriage to which she had been pledged. \\n The NIV, translating atrociously as usual, translated verse 34 as: \\n >How will this be since I am a virgin? \\n The word  parthenos , having already been used by Luke in verse 27  does not occur in verse 34 . \\n The RSV translates the same inquiry of Mary as: \\n >How can this be, since I have no husband? \\n The KJV, on the other hand, offers in this case (as in so many others) a better translation: \\n >How shall this be, seeing  I know not a man ? \\n The NKJV has it: \\n >How can this be,  since I do not know a man ? \\n As has already been stated, the word  parthenos  (virgin) doesn\\'t occur in verse 34. \\n In this case, the RSV has an adequate translation but maybe not the best.  Had Mary said to Gabriel, \"How will this be?  I don\\'t even have a husband,\" Gabriel might have replied, \"When the days of your betrothal are over and you come together with Joseph, you will  know  him and you will bear a son.\" \\n But isn\\'t all that just kind of \"matter of fact\"?  Mary was already betrothed to Joseph, and Gabriel didn\\'t offer any kind of time frame.  Would it have been sensible for Mary to assume that the son she would conceive and bear would be the son of Joseph? \\n The question is,  why did she ask the question . \\n (Another important question is why did the translators of the NIV go  so out of their way  to stick the word \"virgin\" in there when it clearly causes the question of Mary to make even  less  sense. \\n Luke writes, \"Here\\'s a  virgin  betrothed to a man named Joseph and the angel comes to her and tells her she\\'s going to conceive and bear a son; and Mary says to the angel, \\'But how can this be?  I\\'m still a virgin!\" \\n Weird.  Almost like the NIV is  trying  to hide something. \\n Let\\'s take the KJV version again: \\n >How shall this be, seeing  I know not a man ? \\n The word translated \"man\" there is  an\u0113r  which  could  mean \"husband\" but here the translators of the KJV (Authorized Version) have made a deliberate choice. \\n The 1599 Geneva Bible made a similar choice: \\n >How shall this be, seeing I know not man? \\n Luther translated this verse the same way in his Bible: \\n >Wie soll das zugehen, da ich von keinem Manne wei\u00df? \\n \"...keinem Manne wei\u00df...\"  ...   not a man know I . \\n It may be a little known fact, but the Reformers believed in the Perpetual Virginity of Mary.  Indeed, contrary to popular belief, the \"virgin birth\"  does not refer to  the fact that Jesus was conceived without a human father. \\n \"The Virgin Birth\"  means  that Jesus was born  leaving Mary\\'s virginity   in tact .  Mary was a virgin before, during,  and after  the birth of Christ. \\n That\\'s  what \" the virgin birth \" means! \\n So we have this verse, this question that Mary asks the angel that  on the face of it  makes  no  sense.  Mary\\'s betrothed to Joseph, the angel tells her she\\'s going to bear a son who: \\n >...will be great, and will be called the Son of the Most High;\\nand the Lord God will give to him the throne of his father David,\\nand he will reign over the house of Jacob for ever;\\nand of his kingdom there will be no end. \\n And she doesn\\'t ask, \"why me\", but, \"how shall this be  since I   no not man .\" \\n That this son she\\'s going to bear will \"reign over the house of Jacob forever and his kingdom will have no end\", doesn\\'t bother her as much as how she\\'ll possibly conceive in the first place!  She doesn\\'t know man! \\n Tradition has it that Mary was dedicated to the Temple by her parents and her task in the temple was to weave the curtain that mediated the space between the altar and the Holy of Holy\\'s--the veil that was rent asunder, from top to bottom, when her son gave up the ghost on Calvary. \\n As such, it\\'s been suggested that Mary was in fact a consecrated virgin and her betrothal to Joseph, who was a much older man, was intended for Mary\\'s protection and security after the death of her parents.  Whether this might have been a common practice in Second Temple Judaism I don\\'t personally know.  Or how much weight this suggestion has I couldn\\'t tell. \\n All I can say is that verse 34 is a conundrum.  It\\'s a very odd question for Mary to ask unless there was some special reason for her to ask it.  And the angel takes this question in very good humor!  Like it was a very sensible question for Mary to ask! \\n Now contrast that with the way Gabriel responded to Zechari\\'ah just a few verses before!  Zechari\\'ah asked the angel: \\n >How shall I know this? For I am an old man, and my wife is advanced in years. \\n And Gabriel replied: \\n >I was sent to speak to you, and to bring you this good news. And behold, you will be silent and unable to speak until the day that these things come to pass, because you did not believe my words. \\n There isn\\'t any hint, when Mary asked Gabriel, \"How shall this be,\" that he took her question to be a similar admission of incredulity. \\n Of course I haven\\'t answered your question, \"Was Mary a virgin until death?\"  There\\'s still the question of \"the brothers and sisters of Jesus\", including \"James, the brother of the LORD.\" \\n As a Catholic I\\'m dedicated to truth that Mary was a virgin until she died and was assumed into heaven.  (I\\'m a convert so I rationally and eagerly pledged myself to that truth.)  I believe it\\'s a fact.', \"Because Jesus Christ  is  God.  Jesus Christ established his Church.  The Church, St. Paul tells us, is the  body of Christ .  Christ is her  head . \\n Christ gave Peter and the twelve the power to loose and retain  sins --that's  jurisdictional . \\n Likewise, the keys given to Peter are  jurisdictional --they confer on Peter the  power of the king  (think of Joseph in Egypt--second only to the king, and in possession of all the  power  and  authority  of the king). \\n We know from Acts that the  office  of an Apostle is something into which  another  man may be placed, as Matthias was chosen to fill the office left  vacant  by Judas. \\n These are evidences from Scripture but more could be supplied.  But Scripture was never intended to bear the weight that Protestants make it bear.  It was never  meant  as an  all-sufficient  guide to faith and worship or as a  constitution  for the government of the Church. \\n Christ founded a  Church .  He told his disciples to  baptize  and  teach , not to  write .  It's a wonderful blessing for his Church that some  small portion  of his disciples  did  write about their experiences and the experiences of others, and that Paul and Peter and James wrote  universal  epistles meant to correct abuses in particular churches (Paul), to give general instructions for living well as Christians (James), and to strengthen and confirm the brethren (Peter).  But  none  of them wrote to give the  basics  of Church government, worship, or practice, or to give in  written  form what the Apostles preached to potential converts--with the sole exception of Acts, which records a number of sermons given to non-Christians. \\n And not everything was written down.  John tells us of  his  Gospel why he wrote it--so that we may  believe  that Jesus is the Messiah. \\n But all this is getting beside the point, again.\", 'This is actually a GREAT question that is too little discussed. \\n The only wrong way to pray is  not to do it . \\n Prayer should be  sincere .

Those distractions need not be an impediment to the effectiveness of your.  Don\\'t focus on them and don\\'t get discouraged when you\\'re distracted.  Turn your distraction (whatever grabbed your attention) into an occasion of prayer.  So if you get distracted thinking about work, when you realize you\\'ve been thinking about work, say a prayer about work.  If you find yourself thinking about your mom, say a prayer about your mom.  Ask God\\'s blessing on your mom.  Ask Him to guide her into greater and greater truth. \\n Set aside a specific amount of time  each day  to pray. \\n If you can, make a holy hour.  Don\\'t just make a vague resolution to do it.  Actually resolve to get up an hour earlier each day, or give up something else so you have time to  make your holy hour .  Some days I can\\'t do it.  Some days I can only say a rosary before I have to leave.  But think of it as an obligation no less important than any other obligation you\\'ve imposed on yourself like working out, walking, eating healthy, reading, studying, etc.  Whatever you have to do--whatever you can do--find the time. \\n If you can\\'t make a holy hour, at least make time to pray every day.  Don\\'t neglect your daily prayers.  Say a daily rosary--which includes the Our Father, the Creed, and the Hail Mary, as well as many other petitions and meditations for aid in living a holy life. \\n Finally, there\\'s physical attitude. \\n It\\'s hard to find anything in books of prayer or devotion about how you should be oriented--should you kneel, stand, sit..?  Is lying down acceptable? \\n The reason it\\'s hard to find anything is because our prayer doesn\\'t depend on our posture.  Our concentration does?  And certain postures can put us in a mood of devotion.  Lying prostrate before the sacrament is good for us, not for the LORD.  Kneeling humbles us.  Enduring the pain and discomfort of a \"stress position\" can be a penance that we can offer to God through Mary on behalf of ourselves, our family, our friends, the whole world, or the souls in Purgatory. \\n When I make my holy hour, I kneel when I say my rosary.  When I begin to say the Breviary, I sit comfortably.  If i was saying it in company I\\'d probably stand. \\n Finally, try to make a retreat at least once a year.  And/or, attend a conference that has the approval of the local Bishop. \\n If you\\'re in the midwest (Illinois region) I can give you some suggestions.', 'I think that the concept attaching itself to the word \"incarnation\" in an eastern (Hindu/Brahman) context may be different than the concept meant by the word \"incarnation\" in Christianity.  That is to say, we use an English word with a certain history and a particular meaning and then  by a certain violence  rip it out of its original context to make it apply to a  similar but not identical  concept in another language and culture. \\n So what it  means  for Vishnu to be incarnated as Krishna is probably  very different  from what it  meant  for Paul\\'s God, for Peter\\'s God, for Zebedee\\'s God, and for Nicodemus\\' God to be  incarnated  in the womb of a peasant girl in Galilee.  For one thing, it was a  wholly  unique event--without precedent and  completely  unexpected in that culture and at that time. \\n Contrariwise, Krishna was,  what , the  eighth  \"incarnation\" of Vishnu? \\n Also, what it means to achieve \"closeness/union with divinity\" in the eastern Hindu context is as different from  theosis  as the  Brahman  is different from the Father of Jesus Christ.  That is,  insofar as  Brahman is understood as  impersonal , rather than personal, and  insofar as  union with that  divinity  is conceived as a \"swallowing up\" and consequent  destruction  of the personal self in endless being of the  absolute , the concept of \"union with the divine\" in Hinduism is  very, very different  from what it is in Christianity. \\n So although similar language is used, the concepts being understood in their original languages and cultures are completely different.  (I regard English as  an  original language for the reason that the English we speak today owes its development to Christian culture and concepts which were very often adopted  from  the original languages--Greek and Latin.  \"Atonement\" is actually the exception, being one of the  few  theologically significant words that actually English, i.e.  at-one-ment .) \\n That being so, I think that one\\'s  experience  of being presented with the incarnation of Christ versus the incarnation of Vishnu will likely be very, very different, as well.', 'Maybe (just  maybe ) you have a deep, unshakable  un -belief in the same non-entity that your Catholic and Orthodox (and other Christians) brother and sisters  don\\'t believe in . \\n What I mean is, maybe the god-concept of your understanding, formed when you were growing up, the one that habitually comes to mind whenever you think of these subjects, is  not  the same--is not identical with--the God that the Christian faith proclaims.  Maybe the idea of god you formed in your imagination--and which you\\'re unable to believe in--is some sort of  \"supreme-being\", something  like  us only bigger, in a different realm or in a different dimension, not unlike our own, maybe physical but in a different way...but on an entirely different level, and that he just decided, at some point, to start making worlds and universes.  And this is the one he made and he just kind of looks in from outside, occasionally reaching in to dabble with stuff.  Almost like he\\'s just some sort of  super-human  and not the God the Christians adore, who is  - God - , the Father of Our LORD Jesus Christ. \\n And this is the whole problem of idolatry--the worship of things  as  gods who are not God.  The worship of our fellow creatures  created  by God or of the creations of our own minds.  If our god-concept is basically a \"magic sky fairy\", than we, 1.  Don\\'t  have the God of Jesus in mind; and, 2. are right not to believe in it. \\n The Bible is the story of one people\\'s journey toward a more and more perfect knowledge of God.  God took a people and called them  where they were .  He revealed Himself  gradually , in ways suited to their understanding. \\n God called one man, Abraham, so that through him, that is through his seed, all the peoples of the earth would be blessed.  Through whom the  the sins of Adam as well as of Babel would be reversed.  That when this seed was lifted up he would draw all men (i.e.  all nations ) to himself.  That  in him  all humanity would be once again united as one--just as all humanity was once united in \"adam\", from whom all of humanity was generated in the natural way. \\n And of course Paul explicates all of this in great detail in his letter to the Romans, for example.  That just as in Adam all men sinned, and so death came to all because all sinned; so in Christ are all men made alive.  Christ who  conquered  death and tore down the dividing wall among peoples; who sundered the enmity among men which was created by man\\'s enmity with God. \\n Elsewhere, Paul tells us that \"the Law was added because of transgression\".  The sin of man is what creates division among us.  And only in the blood of the sinless one can those divisions begin to be healed. \\n And so God in Christ built  one  Temple,  one  Church,  one  people... e pluribus unum .  That all people might know and worship (i.e. be oriented toward, as toward one\\'s greatest good and end; to give due honor and worthy respect, etc.) the One True God who made heaven and earth, who gives each of us life and with Whom it is our destiny to be united in bonds of love for eternity. \\n That\\'s one view. \\n But another popular view is one that takes all the picture language from the Old Testament at face value, forgetting that its picture language. \\n God revealed His name to Moses out of the \"burning bush\" as \"I AM what I AM\"  or  \"I will be what I will be\".  Either interpretation gets at something deeper and  beyond  the pictures by which God had been described in Genesis and Exodus up to that point.  And it would take many centuries more before, up to the time before Christ, before the Jews could start to marry that self-revelation of God with the concepts and categories of Greek philosophy in order to more fully understand what was finally made explicit when God the Word took on human flesh and \"dwelt among us\". \\n God condescends to our understanding.  In the fullness of time, God, in the Person of the Son, took on human flesh.  The letter to the Hebrews says that the Son of God was made  perfect  by what he suffered.  And the Gospel of Luke tells us that Jesus \"increased in wisdom\" and \"in stature with God and man\".  So, perfect though the Son of Man was according to his divinity, according to his humanity, through which he also suffered and died, he grew.  He was able to experience what we experience  as  we experience it.  He was tempted, just as we all are. \\n But God, by revealing Himself in the likeness of sinful flesh, also revealed Himself according to His divinity in ways that previous generations could have only strained to grasp. \\n So that finally, Aristotle\\'s \"prime mover\"--mainly something either distant, impersonal, or unknowable--could be joined with the revealed attributes of the God of Israel; loving, faithful, just, merciful, deeply interested in His creation, and invested in it even to the point of sharing in our suffering and tribulations.  John can tell us that \"God is spirit\", and can affirm that \"no one has ever seen God\", but, \"the only Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, he has made him known,\" even as God the Son can lament: \\n >O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, killing the prophets and stoning those who are sent to you! How often would I have gathered your children together as a hen gathers her brood under her wings, and you would not! \\n I could go on but I\\'ve already written too much.  If you\\'ve read this far, I\\'m impressed.', 'It\\'s suggested by your OP that you\\'d be a more well behaved person if you had constant supervision. \\n But it\\'s been wisely said that the test of one\\'s character is how you behave when you  don\\'t  think anyone is watching. \\n In other words, the way we behave shouldn\\'t depend on what we think we can get away with, but on the sort of person we really want to be. \\n Trouble is...sometimes we don\\'t always want what we \"want\".  Let me give you an example... \\n I smoked cigarettes for twelve years.  In all that time, I never tried to quit.  I never  cared  to quit.  But a lot of my friends thought they wanted to quit and they tried to quit and then they didn\\'t quit.  I concluded that they really didn\\'t  want  to quit.  If we  want  something-- really  want it--we\\'ll find a way to get it. \\n I think that most of the time, when someone says they want to quit an enjoyable habit, they really mean they think they  should --but they don\\'t really  want  it. \\n Then one day, I decided I  did  want to quit smoking.  ...  So I quit.  I had three cigarettes left in my hard pack of camel lights and I just didn\\'t smoke them.  Every day, I  chose  not to smoke them, because I remembered I didn\\'t want to.  My desire--my  will --to quit smoking was  greater  than my desire to smoke. \\n What we want depends on what we love.  It isn\\'t that we don\\'t  believe  God exists, or that we doubt it, or that we don\\'t really think God is with us, knows us, sees us...  It\\'s that we don\\'t  love  enough. \\n The first and greatest commandment is that we should \"love the LORD our God with all our  heart , and all our  strength , and all our  soul , and all our  mind .  And the second is like it...to love our neighbor as ourselves. \\n And it\\'s one in a  million  Christians I wager who love as we  ought . \\n When we go to confession, we\\'re instructed to go through the Commandments to see where we\\'ve fallen short.  Sometimes it\\'s easy to say, \"I\\'ve been pretty good.  I haven\\'t been coveting or lying or stealing.  I haven\\'t committed murder or adultery.  I\\'ve been good to my parents, I haven\\'t used the Lord\\'s name in vain.  I\\'ve haven\\'t missed Mass on Sundays or on Holy Days of Obligation.  I\\'ve been pretty good.\" \\n But then we might ask ourselves...but have I loved the LORD with all my heart?  Have I loved my neighbor as myself? \\n No.  We love our comfort too much. We love our ease.  We love the pleasure that sloth gives us, and our indulgence in our gluttony and in the satisfaction of our desires. \\n So it isn\\'t that we forget God\\'s cognizant of all we do.  It\\'s that we don\\'t love as we ought.  We\\'re selfish, self-centered, and cowardly.  (I speak for myself.) \\n We can say with the father of the demoniac in Mark ([ 9:24 ]( \"I do believe; help me my unbelief!\"  We can say, \"I  do  want;  help  me to want!\" \\n \"I  love  you, LORD; help me to love you LORD.\" \\n A story is told in the book, \"Everyday Saints\", about an old monk who was known for his skill at working wood.  But one day, he convulsed and everyone thought he was dead.  While he was unconscious he had a vision of the Holy Mother, who told him, \"All these works of wood; and there was but one thing that we desired of you.\" \\n Of a sudden he regained his consciousness.  He told his superior of his vision and requested that he be permitted to devote all of his time to prayer and fasting. \\n The novices knew of this monk and they new his story. He was looked to as a man of particular holiness, evidenced not just by his habits of prayer and fasting, but by his kindness, and by his wisdom. \\n The author of the book tells about how once he went to this old monk to implore his advice. \\n Upon hearing this novices request, the old man said to him, \"Why do you ask me for advice, when I myself am perishing.\" \\n The more we love, the more  genuine  is our love, the more aware we are of our faults, our shortcomings, and how far we have to go.  We desire to be holy but we know that \"within me dwells no good thing.\"  That is, we know that whatever virtue, whatever faith, whatever charity we have, we know that it would never be sufficient apart from the love and mercy of God.  \"For this is love, that while we were  still sinner , Christ died for us.\" \\n \"There but for the grace of God go I.\"']": "Based on the reddit posting history, the user seems to be interested in religious and spiritual topics, specifically Christianity.

So when NBC writes a check to the NFL for $1 billion, alright, the NFL doesn\\'t pay tax on that,  but  it divides the money 32 ways (more or less - there are  really  complicated formulas here), and distributes the money to the teams.  So the NFL won\\'t pay taxes on the money, but the teams most certainly do. \\n \\n Economic development tax breaks are not unique to the NFL.  Hell, the state of New York advertises on TV here that it will give companies a tax break for moving there.  If you build a factory, and move a certain number of jobs, then you get paid according to a state formula.  That\\'s not unique to NY - Florida does it, Texas does it.  Louisiana gives all sorts of tax breaks targeted specifically to the film industry.  This is common.  You can criticize the practice generally all you\\'d like, and there are economic arguments to be made both ways, but singling out the NFL specifically is unfair and naive. \\n \\n \"...regular loophole laden tax evasion of the super rich...\"  Just no.  What the...I don\\'t even?  I have no idea what he\\'s talking about.  Is he mad that companies are taxed on profit, rather than revenue?   Is he mad that depreciation is a real thing?  Does he think that the NFL employs a magic tax genie who reduces income rates from 40% to 4% if you include a team-signed ball with your tax check?  Does he assume that team owners just collect dividends (which are taxed at 23.8% federal) rather than personal income (43.4% federal), and doesn\\'t understand that if they teams are structured as pass-through entities, the owners  are  paying 43.4% federal, and if they\\'re structured as C-Corporations, they\\'re paying corporate income tax of 35%  plus  23.8% of the dividends they pay themselves net of taxes?  Does he think dividends are deductible at any level (hint: dividends are  never  a deductible business expense in the United States)?  I have no idea what the fuck he\\'s talking about, and I sincerely doubt you\\'re even still reading this fucking wall of text at this point, anyway.', \"I've looked at it before, and I don't understand the accounting.  I believe they're counting treasury stock as an asset - and I know they're voting it. \\n I also know that annual CEO compensation is around 5-10% of the company's market cap.  I'd be more specific, but I can't figure what the company's market cap really even is, since they're screwing around with the accounting for shares outstanding. \\n I think it's entirely likely that within the next 5 years, the SEC will be officially investigating both BH and Sardar Biglari, personally.\", \"Think of it this way: you  do  (effectively) get to deduct 100% of charitable works. \\n Economically, it's like you charged a fair market rate for your services and donated those wages to the charity.  Whether you just don't report the income and offsetting deduction (as is the case in reality), or you recognize the income and then immediately deduct it (as in our hypothetical), the end result is the same.  (Really your tax burden is actually slightly lower with the status quo, as you do not lose payroll taxes here.)\", 'It\\'s not unethical or sketchy - it\\'s just unusual. \\n By rule, there are 11 players on the field at any given time.  6 of these 11 are \"eligible receivers\" - i.e., it\\'s not a penalty if they catch a (non-deflected) pass.  (Before people tell you that I\\'m wrong, because there are only 5 eligible receivers, they\\'re forgetting to count the quarterback, since quarterbacks virtually never catch forward passes, despite being eligible to do so.) \\n The 5 players who are not \"eligible receivers\" are, intuitively, \"ineligible receivers.\"  If they catch a pass, it\\'s a penalty on the offense.  These 5 players must be on (interpreted as within 1 yard of) the line of scrimmage.  Typically, these are your offensive linemen (left tackle, left guard, center, right guard, and right tackle). \\n By rule, there must be a total of 7 players on the line of scrimmage.  The two players on the line of scrimmage closest to the sidelines are, by rule, eligible receivers.  The other 4 eligible receivers must be at least one yard behind the line of scrimmage. \\n So a typical, traditional formation might have the 5 ineligible linemen on the line of scrimmage, with a tight end \"covering\" the left tackle, one wide receiver on the line of scrimmage close to the right sideline, a wide receiver just behind the line of scrimmage near the left sideline, the quarterback directly behind the center, with two running backs behind him. \\n There are strict rules in the NFL about player numbers.  Specifically, players must wear numbers in a range allotted by the NFL to their normal position (for example, wide receivers must wear a number between either 10-19, or 80-89).  Players whose normal position is a RB, QB, WR, or TE (...or, technically, kickers and punters, but special teams formations are beyond the scope of your question) are automatically considered to be eligible receivers  unless they specifically tell the referee otherwise before the play begins .  Likewise, players who play a position where they would typically be considered an ineligible receiver must report to the referee if they\\'re going to be lined up in the position (and role) of an eligible receiver. \\n The referee generally announces this over the stadium PA system, and at minimum must inform a defensive captain about this, so they know who to cover, and who they can ignore. \\n Aside from punt or field goal formations, it\\'s pretty rare for players to switch roles (not many offensive linemen are going to line up as a wide receiver, or vice versa).  The Patriots, however,  have  been doing this a lot recently.  Other teams don\\'t see it much, so they\\'re often confused. \\n And that\\'s the point.  The Patriots, while doing everything perfectly inside the rules, are trying to catch the other team off guard, and get a big play out of it. \\n The Patriots had a play last night where they had their big left tackle declare himself eligible, and didn\\'t have any other receivers line up on the line of scrimmage between him and the sideline.  But what was tricky about it was that it  looked  like a normal formation.  But it wasn\\'t, because there was nobody wearing a traditional \"eligible receiver\" type number lined up on the line of scrimmage between him and the sideline. When Brady threw the ball to a 350-lb lineman, the Colts were surprised, since it\\'s not something you see much.  But it was perfectly legal, and the referee  specifically told the defense that it was a possibility .', \"Well, I don't know about that.  When I was a grand juror, probably 80% of the cases only had one witness to begin with - so there was nobody there to contradict him/her. \\n Besides, the prosecutor gets to hand pick which witnesses it presents, since the defense doesn't get to participate.  The standard for indictment is so low, the prosecutors were always shocked the few times we sent back even a partial no bill. \\n I mean there was one case where there was literally no evidence that any crime had been committed, there was no complaining witness, no anything.  Literally, one of the officers who came in to testify was asked flat out if he knew of any evidence that suggested the alleged crime had actually been committed by anyone (not just by the suspect, by  anyone  - did he know of any evidence that showed that the charged crime had ever actually taken place at all).  He said no.   That charge got true billed!\"]": "Based on the postings, the user is interested in the following areas:\n1. Personal finance and investing\n2. NFL and sports taxation \n3.

I have Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI) which is basically brittle bone disease.  The gene is carried on one of my X chromosomes which means every child we conceive has a 50% chance of inheriting it.  There are four types.  I have the the second best kind (type 4), which means I'm more prone to breaks than the average person, but not from simple things like walking (which could happen with types 3 and 2). \\n Anyway, we have one child and she inherited this disease from me.  Her doctor at Children's Hospital suggested we look into IVF for future children so we don't pass the OI on.  Initially I thought they could simply remove the OI gene, but apparently they just discard the infected embryo's. \\n Our issue is; should we play God? On the one hand I don't want any more children to suffer because of a disease I passed on, but on the other hand if we had passed our daughter up we would have missed out on someone so incredibly amazing.  She is perfect in every way, but she will have to be cautious her entire life because of her OI. What if we threw away an embryo of someone equally as incredible? \\n We're not religious people by any stretch of the imagination.  We got pregnant the first month we stopped trying, two months before we decided we were really going to start trying. She was meant to be. We believe in fate.  We're also afraid of giving up the magic that comes with getting pregnant on your own...the fact that  that  baby was  meant  to happen. \\n Opinions?\", \"I had my daughter almost exactly 6 months ago.  I actually had my first post natal period in February but it was extremely light.  I got my first real one yesterday evening, and today I've had an extremely heavy flow, going through super tampons in 1.5-2 hours (sorry for being graphic). \\n Prior to having my daughter my periods were relatively light and I never even needed supers, even on my heaviest days.  Also I'm experiencing cramps for the very first time in my life (painful, radiating cramps that shoot down my legs).  I did have a c-section, so I'm assuming maybe it's just not healed 100%?  I don't feel light headed, but the hormones (I'm assuming) made it difficult to sleep last night and I've been a tad bit off today.  Is this normal? Should I be concerned? I plan on calling the doctor, but they're not open until 9am and I would like a little piece of mind since they take forever to get back in touch with me.\", \"3.5 months ago my daughter was born.  At 6 hours old she was transported to a hospital 30 minutes away for special care and evaluation due to a bone condition (that we and our doctors were aware of prior to delivery), but we were not warned ahead of time this would happen. The reason? Our hospital didn't have a NICU. \\n When my friend, who was 6 months pregnant at the time, caught wind she went to her hospital and was told they too didn't have a NICU.  They explained it wouldn't be an issue for her since her baby was healthy and mine was not, and that the NICU wasn't necessary in her case.  Fast forward, she delivered this evening by emergency C-Section, and you guessed it...baby was taken to another hospital before she even got a chance to see him let alone hold him. \\n Having the child you carried for 9 months taken from you immediately after birth is one of the most terrifying, devastating and sobering experiences in the world.  I am forever changed by this event, as I know she will be and mothers who also had this happen to them.  No child should be separated from their mother so early.

She isn't quite coordinated enough to play with toys so I'm constantly picking up the toys shes dropped playing in the bumbo.

This, the pediatrician said, was perfectly normal, especially since she was so tiny when born and needs to do a little catch up. \\n The last few nights, however, she's been fussing after the 3oz before bed like she's still starving.  I put her to bed anyway the last few nights but after an hour of her hollering and complaining I would give up and give her another 2oz and she would promptly go to bed for 5 hours.  Tonight I skipped that step and offered her 4.5oz before bed and she didnt give me a hard time about going down.  The pediatrician never called back.

Due to the nature of how animals grow, I cannot give an exact date for when the meat will be ready, but again, it will be around Nov. The ranchers who will be raising the animal will be helping me source a quality animal.\\nThe steer will be grass fed only, with ZERO grain. I will also be able to dry age the meat. If you want some of your cuts dry aged, we can discuss that when the time comes. There will be a minimal fee for this (whatever it costs me to do it.) When the meat is ready, I will deliver it to your home or business, or we can meet at a central location. \\n Keep track of our various projects on the Tacosaurus Meat Share Facebook Page: \\n About me: I\u2019m 30 originally from Brownsville, TX and have lived in Austin for 1.5 yrs.

Loved it. But I was curious about something. \\n To me, it was pretty obvious Mr. Robot was a figment/alternate personality/Tyler Durden to Elliot. I suspected after the first episode and my suspicions only grew until the reveal. \\n As someone who loves watching theories unravel as shows go on normally and who missed out on it this for this show, what were people thinking as the show was airing? \\n Was this a popular theory? Usually I'm pretty bad with guessing what's going to happen in shows, but this one just felt like Fight Club. Not saying that's bad, I loved it, it just had that vibe.  After a few episodes I even was thinking of telling my friend to watch it cause it was like Fight Club since he and I are huge fans of that movie. Glad I didn't cause it might have spoiled it.\", \"Honestly, every Star Trek series has fans who love it and fans who don't, you will hear a lot of people talk shit about shows while others love them.  My advice, screw everyone else's opinion and watch the show yourself.  Form your own opinion.  Personally I loved Voyager.  DS9 is my least favorite out of all of them because I absolutely hate huge political things, and DS9 did way too much of that for me to enjoy it, even with the cool war.  I just started watching Enterprise and I'm not far enough to form an opinion but I'm going in with a neutral feeling because I know a lot of people didn't like it, but I'm going to make my own opinion of it.  So I would say forget everything you read in this thread, go finish DS9, go watch Voyager, then watch Enterprise (When in doubt always watch in air date order), and make of them what you will.\", 'I would not recommend it.

A game where you can slowly take over the map and eventually rule the entire game. \\n Sorry for the long rantpost here: \\n This is an insatiable urge that I have.  So far the only game I have played that seems to quell it is Godfather: The Game.  If you haven't played it, you have a whole map of New York to play in, with 100+ businesses spread across it. \\n Pros:  At any time (not during a mission obviously) you can go take over a business, kill the enemy mobsters, and extort the owner.  The business is now yours and makes you money.  You can do this for every business on the map and by the end of the game you are the Don of New York.  You own everything, you've defeated the other families, and you rule supreme. \\n The gunplay is pretty great with a lock-on targeting system and ability to take cover anywhere.  You can target specific parts like a leg and cripple an enemy so they can't run, or their arm to disarm them. \\n Some businesses are more difficult to take over with more guards, so you have to wait til you are a higher level and have better guns to take these down.  So there is a little strategy in what to take over and when. \\n Cons: The game was made in 2006, so almost all of the businesses are tilesets with only like 8 variations.  So while this is fun, it can get very repetitive as even the enemies spawn in the same positions at different locations.  Also its the same game everytime. \\n I play this game every year or two because I have yet to find another like it that I enjoy as much, but it's the same game everytime and I don't want to play it again, but I need to satisfy this urge. \\n They made a sequel, The Godfather II, in 2009, which wasn't as good as the first.  It did add some really cool elements into this taking over the map aspect. \\n Pros: Enemy families now attack your businesses from time to time and if you don't have good enough defense or go defend it yourself, they can take it from you and you have to go reclaim it.  But this is really fun considering the other thing they added: \\n Your own team of specialists.  As the Don of your own family you can recruit people as your Enforcers, Capos, etc.  You can have these guys follow you around as a squad to take over these places, or can even send them as defenders to a business being attacked if you don't want to deal with it yourself. \\n Cons:  The map is split up into several smaller maps now instead of one big map to take over.  There is a significantly lower number of businesses, maybe 30-40 across the whole game.  The whole game felt cheap and simple.  Gunplay was not as great as in the first one. \\n The attacks that the enemy families do are usually pretty spread out and rarely a real threat.  The businesses are mostly the same difficulty and therefore not a lot of strategy in which places you hit and when. \\n So what I'm really looking for\", 'Generally speaking, sci-fi actors tend to act in sci-fi, comedy actors act in comedies, etc.  That\\'s why you will never see Jim Carrey in a non-comedy movie and you\\'ll never see Samuel L.

One, they have to maintain a balance for the light and dark sides. There is no other OT light saber wielder to balance out Ben. It's possible that to balance Ben they might use the red imperial guards with their force pike, but those characters are so unimportant, I doubt they would get their own special slot. And the point of Yoda in the OT is to take a path away from violence and become one with the force. \\n What I think is more likely is that we will see a character from the new SW movie.

Please add to or critique what I\\'ve said. \\n Now that we\\'ve seen Clara in a good number of episodes, I\\'m starting to become concerned of the similarities in the way that her character is fleshed out to the way that Amy\\'s character was fleshed out. Note, I am not drawing a comparison to their personalities. Instead I am drawing a comparison between their back stories. \\n Much like Moffat did with Amy, it seems that so far Clara\\'s episodes almost obsessively focus on the companion. I personally find this very irritating - I like it better when the companions serve as an audience proxy / very HUMAN companion instead of the center of some huge mystery (although as I type that out I realize that Rose with Bad Wolf and Donna with Doctor-Donna are both the centers of big events, however the mystery behind these was not harped on so much throughout their episodes. It was more subtle? in a way. Definitely off track from my main point though). Despite this focus on the companion, who we are supposed to care immensely for, we know so little about both Amy\\'s (and so far Clara\\'s) \"Real life\"! We don\\'t know much about their friends, families, etc., which is partially what I think makes RTD\\'s companions so relatable. \\n I guess I made this post because I grew to very much dislike Amy (for a variety of reasons), and do not want to dislike Clara. I so much hope that Clara is given more \"Real life\" connections. \\n Here is a previous comment I made on the subject that hopefully sums up what I\\'m trying to argue, although it might be repetitive: \\n \"One of the problems I have had so far with Moffat\\'s era is that much of the show revolves around Amy, and yet... we know next to nothing about her life outside the Doctor. She was also paired with the same Doctor for a longer stretch of time than any one regeneration/companion pairing in NuWho. \\n Rose: We got to know her relationship with her mother, her father, and her sometimes boyfriend. Jackie, Pete, and Mickey all had their own personalities and at points were a tangential part of a major plot. \\n Martha: We got to know her mother, father, brother, and sister. I would say they had lesser roles than Rose\\'s family, but each seemed to have a distinct personality and at times were a tangential part of a major plot. \\n Donna: We got to know her mother and grandfather. Wilfred in particular played a major role across several episodes, most notably that he is the reason 10 regenerates! While her mum was not as important to the plot, it did show a possible influence on why Donna acts or feels the way she does. \\n Amy: We got to know her husband Rory, obviously, but he was a companion as well and did not significantly add to her life outside of the doctor. After that... ? We know she lived with her aunt growing up (who I don\\'t think we ever meet), and that when the TARDIS explodes her parents come back (who, again, I don\\'t recall ever meeting... maybe for a moment at the wedding?). To me this has the effect of making Amy seem like less of a real person. \\n Rory: We got to know his wife Amy, obviously, and his father. I\\'ve always liked Rory more than Amy (my personal opinion), but I definitely think that having episodes with his father made him seem more real and multi-dimensional. It also made me care more about his fate. When Rory and Amy are sent back in time by the angels, I thought about how much his father would miss him. I imagined how his father would find out, how he would react, etc. I did not have the same thoughts for Amy\\'s family... by being sent back in time she really didn\\'t seem to lose anything important. \\n I hope that we learn more of Clara\\'s family, friends, background, etc. than we did with Amy. I am also not personally excited about the mystery surrounding her deaths/lives, but just looking forward to a new Doctor/companion relationship!\"', 'Season 6 is by far my favorite season. I don\\'t know if there\\'s any way I can convince you that it\\'s enjoyable, as we all have different opinions about what makes the best episodes/seasons. \\n For me, as someone who has struggled with mental health issues and depression, Season 6 captured my feelings of emptiness in a way that no other show has (that I\\'ve seen). I think the season does an amazing job of exploring depression - not just as sadness, but as a despondency and detachment from the world. Buffy\\'s struggle to accept life is very real to me. \\n For other characters as well, everything falls apart. Giles leaves everything he has been a part of for so many years behind, Anya has her heart broken and seems to lose her chance at a normal human life, Willow loses not only her lover but her moral compass and sanity, Spike realizes that his lack of a soul is preventing him from creating real connections. There is no quick fix to the problems that happen, no magic spell or words that can make things better (as made a little too obvious with the magic as addiction storyline). \\n I also really enjoy the Buffy/Spike secret liaison. While I don\\'t ship B/S, because I think none of Buffy\\'s relationships are ultimately good for her and think she is better alone, I still find it a very interesting (and titillating) story line. The first time they have sex is HOT. I also like the secrecy, and the moments of bonding or tension that arise as a result of it. One of my favorite scenes with Tara is when Buffy confides in her. I also love the fallout that happens when Anya/Spike sleep together and everyone finds out. There is so much secrecy and betrayal and hurt. \\n I also think Season 6 has some really brilliant episodes, both serious and humorous. Once More With Feeling and Tabula Rasa are two of my favorite episodes. \\n I don\\'t particularly think the trio or Dark Willow are any more interesting/better than other \"Big Bads\", but it is other aspects of the season that make me love it. In fact, Season 6 isn\\'t really about a Big Bad - it\\'s about learning to live with yourself in spite of the mistakes you\\'ve made, the bad experiences you\\'ve had, or whatever bullshit life has thrown at you. \\n I do agree with you about hating the fact that Giles leaves. Although I understand the reasons why, how it was meant to strip the scoobies (particularly Buffy) of adult guidance and have them become independent. The only way I can accept his leaving is because I honestly don\\'t think the writers were using him effectively any more. In early seasons he had a job, was seriously necessary for research/guidance/watcherness/general knowledge, had relationships that weren\\'t only with the scoobies (with Jenny and Ethan Rayne), etc. The writers should have given him more to do after the end of the high school in S3, not less. They finally have him own the Magic Box, but I would have loved to see him have another real relationship (not a barely mentioned fling with a character we know nothing about) and advance his knowledge of demons and INCREASE his usefulness. But I digress from the main discussion of Season 6....', 'Based on this paragraph, it seems as though this author does not take into account the nuanced relationships that characters (both male and female) have to supernatural powers. Males are not solely reduced to a negative relationship with mystical powers, nor females to a solely positive relationship. \\n First, I feel like the Buffyverse often calls into question notions of \"good\" or \"evil\". While Angel/Angelus is an obvious presentation of that binary, Spike\\'s relationships with good and evil are much more nuanced. He initially uses his powers for destructive purposes, but as he grows he begins to use them to help Buffy and the scoobies. \\n The same uncertain relationship to the supernatural can be seen with Oz. When he becomes a werewolf, he attacks others. Yet throughout the series Oz actively tries to fight this urge and is seen taking steps to bring it under control. Is he bad or evil merely because he was a victim of a werewolf bite? \\n Not to mention the fact that women with supernatural powers are not solely good. Amy has the same type of power as Willow (use of magic), but she is more often seen using her abilities for \"bad\" ends - manipulating teachers, controlling passersby at the Bronze, even morphing Willow into the man that killed her lover. \\n Another recurring female character that seems to have an even more straightforward relationship with \"bad\" powers is Anyanka. She spent over a thousand years as a vengeance demon, solely using her power to punish others. Even after being a human for a few years, when she regains her powers she once again uses them to harm others. \\n Perhaps the most obvious example of an evil female character is Season 5\\'s big bad, Glory. She has an enormous amount of power and only uses it for her selfish purposes, killing and destroying much around her. \\n I think it is more interesting to focus on character motivation. Why do characters with powers use them for either good or evil? Does Angelus even have a choice? Does Anyanka? Does Glory? Other characters such as Amy or the Trio seem to have more free will in the matter, and actively choose their paths. \\n I am also not convinced that Giles is a \"decidedly\" feminized character. I would have to read more on the specific evidence as to why or why not. \\n Yes, BTVS can definitely be used to explore notions of gender roles, stereotypes, etc. However, it seems as though this author wanted to argue for a particular stance, which may not fully include the dynamic male and female characters throughout the series.', '1) Buffy very clearly ended her \"relationship\" with Spike episodes before this \\n 2) Their relationship NEVER included Spike coming uninvited into her home, her space to have sex. They always had sex outside of her place. \\n 3) Spike knows that she is injured before he acts (Note: I am not positive on this point, but from what I remember he comments on it. I am not willing to rewatch the scene to confirm or deny, so if anyone knows otherwise let me know). \\n 4) The answer to Buffy\\'s question, \"Ask me again why I could never love you,\" is partially  because  Spike does NOT have a soul. His behavior in this scene is one example of how not having a soul affects the way he acts. \\n 5) This IS an attempted rape. I know the author claims he/she is not victim blaming, but it sure as hell feels like it to me. They are framing Buffy as causing this to happen because she led Spike on. Even if she had led him on before (which I don\\'t think she did) that in no way makes this right. \\n This incident is very much unlike any other time Spike/Buffy had sex. The author of this post tries to argue that Spike couldn\\'t have known it was wrong because of their past experiences, BUT THIS IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THAN ALL OF THE OTHER TIMES (See points 1, 2, 3).', 'I definitely agree with your points that people enjoy characters with more drama/excitement, neither of which Riley has. \\n That said, I personally think people understand that he was supposed to be \"that guy\", but that doesn\\'t make it any more enjoyable to watch. People make the same argument about Dawn, that her whiny behavior is a natural result of the adversity she face - yes, that\\'s true, but I  don\\'t care to see it . I don\\'t care if the writers designed characters to have boring/shitty traits; that\\'s not enough for me to appreciate the characters. \\n It\\'s possible to make characters have flaws or be more boring while still  interesting to watch . This is predicated on a combination of good writing, character development, and capable actors. While BTVS tends to have good writing (aside from some major dud episodes), and Riley certainly undergoes character development (although his descent to vampire-feeding seemed to happen to quickly), the actor just wasn\\'t very good. He seemed stiff and wooden, not just in a \"soldierly\" way but in a bad-acty way. He seemed to have pretty much 1-2 facial expressions: serious and happy. \\n Riley\\'s character also seemed to have pretty much zero non-scooby connections post-initiative (which actually coincides with one of my main critiques of Tara: where were her friends and outside life?). Wasn\\'t he a TA? Shouldn\\'t he have continued in school? Angel had an outside life (history with Spike/Drusilla, fighting demons on his own, keeping secrets from Buffy) and even Spike did too (relationships with Dru/Harmony, friendship with Clem, keeping secrets from Buffy). Riley pretty much became a paper cut out once the initiative shut down (although with eventual bonus keeping secrets from Buffy). He was so far beyond boring at that point. \\n I don\\'t care that Riley was a part of a normal relationship. Tara was Willow\\'s generally boring/normal lover, and aside from a few critiques I have of her I don\\'t think she was a complete waste of a character. In fact many people seem to like Tara that dislike Riley. \\n Went off on a tangent, so I guess here\\'s my too long, didn\\'t read:', 'As someone who is not the biggest fan of ATS, I found myself always looking forward to crossovers because I love BTVS more. Even the episodes during Season 4 of ATS when Faith busts out of jail (and later goes back to BTVS) were amazing to me. I also loved when Angel would pop up on BTVS... although I think it was good for him to leave after Season 3, his interactions with Buffy are still great and the tension makes for good tv. \\n So yes, I personally think there should have been more crossovers. \\n However, I think they had to really establish ATS as its own show. If there had been too much crossovers, it could have turned off fans that only watched one of the shows. \\n It would have been nice to have a bit more integration with some of the big bads... Why wasn\\'t the sun blotted out in Sunnydale? Why didn\\'t Jasmine\\'s spell affect Sunnydale? (although I think that one can be explained by the general emigration/power outage in Sunnydale at the time) Why didn\\'t the first affect Angel? \\n On a somewhat related note, it\\'s also really disappointing to me that ATS only lasted for one season after BTVS went off the air, because it really can stand alone (not to mention season 5 is the best and I could always use more Spike). \\n I also think it\\'s interesting how different the role of prophesy is in each of the shows. It was kind of emphasized Season 1 of BTVS (the prophesy of the master, and I think Buffy\\'s death was prophesied) but then that aspect fades out. Prophesy is so essential to the entirety of ATS (e.g. the Shanshu prophesy). I feel like if there were so many \"prophesies\", there would have been more about Buffy herself and some of the action that goes down in Sunnydale. Her completely changing the Slayer line, not to mention averting multiple apocalypses (\"I suddenly find myself needing to know the plural of apocalypse\") would definitely have warranted as many prophesies about a \"Vampire with a soul\". \\n I kind of got off track with your basic question, so...', 'I think her pressuring Angel to leave is one of the best things she ever did. Everyone knew that Buffy/Angel was doomed to fail, even Buffy and Angel knew it (as demonstrated in their responses to the mayor\\'s comments). But it wasn\\'t until that conversation that Angel was finally willing to take the step he needed to end things. Joyce wasn\\'t afraid to stand up for what she thought was the right thing to do. \\n Yes, Joyce makes mistakes-she\\'s human! She was just trying to be the best mom that she could be. She even warms up to Buffy being the slayer and accepts that Buffy has to patrol. She is excited when Buffy gets into competitive schools and accepts when she chooses to stay local. She repairs the damage Buffy\\'s fights cause in the house without ever complaining (Buffy only realizes how much Joyce had to do after her death). She trusts that Buffy will save her even though Buffy hasn\\'t visited in weeks (when Faith attacks). When she finds out Dawn isn\\'t her real daughter and is fact a mystical key that she will never truly be able to understand, she still  loves and accepts  her. She is ultimately a caring mother and a good person. \\n As for her \"complete lack of imagination,\" I don\\'t blame her for not being able to understand Buffy\\'s chosen-ness. Why? Because Buffy never lets her far enough in! It\\'s understandable for Joyce to be freaked out and reject slayerness, quite simply because  she does not understand it . How is she supposed to know that Buffy is the only one that has the super powers to save everyone? I\\'m not blaming Buffy for not making more of an effort to explain; I understand that Buffy is a teenager dealing with a mess of problems on top of the typical high school ones. I just think a level of understanding needs to be given to Joyce in her role as a mother to a distant teenage daughter. \\n The Joyce/Angel incident is also an interesting example of a character action that goes unknown by other characters. A typical show would have shown Buffy finding out what her mother did and rebelling even further. But instead, Angel and Joyce keep that interaction to themselves. This is less a comment on Joyce and more on the brilliance of the show in general, but god I love how it doesn\\'t always \"tie up loose ends\", because it give the entire thing a more realistic feel. Every little interaction isn\\'t always revealed or resolved for every person involved. Life is messy and complicated and sometimes people do manage to keep things from each other. \\n It\\'s similar to the way that Giles keep it a secret that Xander remembered everything when he was turned into a hyena or how Buffy doesn\\'t tell Willow how Xander said she wanted Buffy to give Angel hell (until it is briefly mentioned seasons later).']": "Based on the reddit postings, the user seems to be interested in the following areas: \n1.

I find it aggravating that the player knows all of this and has even told me what I should be doing. I know I'm not the best GM but I find it is unnecessary and problematic.

Additionally the character is already one of the most powerful characters in the group, they are a spell caster who has enough strength to be a viable melee attacker. Before getting to the area where Glassstaff is they found one of the chests and found a magical longsword, so they still would come out with a magical item.\\nOverall I think they will be upset that Glassstaff wasn't in the area and that they don't get the weapon. As well I think if I change the weapon they will be even worse. As well I don't want the weapon there because I think it could warp the game even more, and the player had boasted about how many weapons they have which I didn't like. Mostly because it seems like they only care about having the most powerful items in the game compared to role playing.

PLEASE UPVOTE FOR VISIBILITY \\n \\n Week 4 vs. Giants \\n In the Thursday night matchup, the Redskins were dominated on both sides of the ball by the Giants. According to ProFootballFocus, Orakpo had one of his worst games of his career ending the night with zero total pressures and a grade of -3.0. During this  game Orakpo actually was allowed to rush the passer 39 of 42 (93%) of eligible passing attempts. Here are some plays of Orakpo getting no penetration. \\n \\n [Play 25]( [Play 26]( and [Play 27]( \\n \\n One thing that was certainly noticeable in this game was that Orakpo seemed to be hesitant in his rushes. Versus the Jaguars and lining up on the left side versus the Eagles it seemed like Orakpo was very decisive with his actions and movements. Versus the Giants, however, Orakpo seemed to stutter step way too often for it to be left unnoticed. Play 30 was actually against the Eagles, but I felt it was important to show his stutter stepping and indecisiveness here. \\n \\n [Play 28]( [Play 29]( and [Play 30]( \\n \\n There were a couple of plays where there could have been a holding call like in plays 31 and 32, but there is no excuse for his dissapointing performance against the Giants. \\n \\n [Play 31]( and [Play 32]( \\n \\n \\n Week 5 vs. Seahawks \\n In the Monday night matchup versus the Seahawks, the Redskins defense recorded 16 total pressures, but Wilson was still able to complete 75% of his passes while picking up over 120 yards on the ground. This game was very frustrating. The Redskins defensive put constant pressure on Wilson but only recorded 3 sacks. \\n \\n [Play 33]( - Orakpo rips through Okung to chase down Wilson, but Wilson uses his elusiveness to escape the pocket making the downfield throw. If this was any other QB besides Wilson, this play would have been a sack without a doubt. \\n \\n [Play 34]( - Orakpo gets inside penetration but Wilson releases the ball too quickly for it to be effective. \\n \\n [Play 35]( - Orakpo again helps chase down Wilson but Wilson uses his escapeability to make the downfield play while avoiding the pressure. \\n \\n \\n Overall, Orakpo had an average performance against the Seahawks. Wilson was too elusive to bring down even though the Redskins clearly put pressure on the QB. \\n \\n Week 6 vs. Cardinals \\n Afer two subpar weeks, Orakpo stepped up his game against the Cardinals recording 6 total pressures. \\n \\n [Play 36]( - Orakpo gets a free run at the QB delivering a hit. \\n \\n [Play 37]( - Orakpo uses his speed rush around the edge to close on Palmer right while he's throwing the ball. \\n \\n [Play 38]( - This is by far the closest any defender will get to a sack. Orakpo cuts inside off of a bullrush. Orakpo almost records the sack but somehow Palmer dumps the ball to his RB while he's getting dragged down to the ground. \\n \\n [Play 39]( - Orakpo gets decent pressure off of the bullrush, but the LG switches off of his double-team to assist the LT. The LG gets away with a jersey tug to slow Orakpo down. \\n \\n [Play 40]( - Orakpo uses his speed rush and gets a holding call to slow the drive down. \\n \\n [Play 41]( - His game wasn't perfect. In the 4th quarter an all too familiar sight occurred where Orakpo pulls a Carlos Rodgers dropping an easy interception. Many will remember this dropped interception and think Orakpo had a bad game, but this is far from the truth in this game. \\n \\n \\n \\n Week 7 vs. Titans \\n During this game, Orakpo only played in 36 snaps before he was injured for the season tackling RB Sankey. He was actually playing pretty well picking up double teams all\\ngame and still made an impact. \\n \\n [Play 42]( - Orakpo gets double teamed by the TE and RB and he still disrupts the QB from progressing through his reads. \\n \\n [Play 43]( - Orakpo hits the QB in the pocket after dodging a chip block by the RB and then juking around the LT. \\n \\n [Play 44]( - Orakpo cuts to the inside of the LT and makes decent progress only to be picked up again in another double-team by the Titans offensive line. \\n \\n \\n \\n Summary \\n In the 2014 season, Orakpo has shown that at times he can be a very effective pass rusher if he's decisive with his moves. When he is not it clearly shows through his stutter-stepping at the top of his pass rush. He NEEDS to commit to one move and determine it pre-snap if need be. It also doesn't help he gets double-teamed more often than Kerrigan on the opposite side, and has to battle the top tackle on each team. Outside of pass rushing, Orakpo is an excellent run defender and actually solid in pass coverage. \\n The main issue from a fan's perspective is that sacks dominate the headlines making overall players like Orakpo appear less valuable than one dimensional pass rushers. Orakpo becomes an unrestricted free agent in 2015. The Redskins won't use their franchise tag on him again due to his injury concerns, but will probably try to sign him cheaply to a short-term contract. If we can sign him to anything under $6-7 mil/yr I think he is worth it. If I had to wager, I think he will be wearing a different uniform next year.\", \"I feel like mock drafts are kind of pointless right now until we figure out who is our HC, OC and DC. \\n We don't even know if we are still running a 3-4 or 4-3. What about olineman? If Jay Gruden because HC are we still doing zone-blocking? If not Licht, Montgomery, Chester, and probably Polumbus might all be gone. \\n If we run a 4-3 then we don't need another ILB. We would need another DT and maybe some OLB if Orakpo and Kerrigan get moved to DE. Cofield can fit both schemes so he's set.\", 'HERE IS THE FULL VERSION WITH INTERGRATED GIFS ]( \\n I wanted to take a look at the three interceptions Redskins\u2019 Kirk Cousins threw in the 4th quarter. It is key to understand why they were caused in order to determine if they are correctable mistakes or just a product of physical skill. \\n The Redskins were down 23-13 to the Cardinals in the 4th quarter with 10:27 remaining on the clock. \\n As a side note, InsideTheFilmRoom reached out to me to see if I wanted to do my Redskins breakdowns on their website. I will still post them here as well as a self post. \\n \\n Interception 1  -   [GIF1]( and [GIF2]( \\n Kirk Cousins started the Redskins on his own 20 yard line driving the ball to the Cardinals 47 yard line. It was 1st and 10 with 8:42 remaining in the game. \\n Offensive Personnel: 3 WR (Garcon, Roberts, Jackson) \u2013 1 TE (Reed) \u2013 1 RB (Helu) \\n Kirk Cousins started in shotgun with Helu in the backfield. Jackson and Garcon line up as the outside receivers with Roberts in the slot. Reed lines up on the right side of the line of scrimmage. Garcon runs a curl, Roberts runs a post, and Jackson runs a post-corner, while Reed and Helu stay for extra protection. \\n The Cardinals are in single-high safety, using man-to-man coverage on the outside and bracket coverage over Jackson by CB Peterson and FS Mathieu. \\n Cousins snaps the ball and watches the bracket coverage over Jackson and he releases the ball to Roberts once he makes a break on the ball. Roberts gets separation on his break and has a lot of working space over the middle, but Cousins delivers the ball too far down the field and behind Roberts giving FS Johnson an easy interception. \\n \\n Interception 2  - [GIF1]( and [GIF2]( \\n Fortunately for the Redskins the Cardinals punted the ball to Washington\u2019s 11 yard line. Cousins led another drive down the field to Arizona\u2019s 42 yard line. The play was a simple WR Screen pick play to Jackson. \\n Offensive Personnel: 3 WR (Garcon, Roberts, Jackson) \u2013 1 TE (Reed) \u2013 1 RB (Helu) \\n Reed, Roberts, and Jackson line up in a bunch right formation and Garcon on the outside left. SS Bucannon playing in the box releases to cover Reed, CB Peterson covers the outside assuming Jackson is going deep, and CB Powers lines up directly over Roberts in man-to-man coverage. The ball is snapped and what should be a quick throw to Jackson, he hesitates with the ball and then releases it. This is what causes the interception. Johnson has time to break through the pick and make a play on the ball. Terribly executed by Kirk Cousins. \\n \\n Interception 3  - [GIF1]( and [GIF2]( \\n Redskins defense once again steps up and forces a quick three and out on the Cardinals defense giving the Redskins another chance to come back in the game. Cousins leads a drive from Washington\u2019s 36 to score making the game 20-23 in the Cardinals favor. \\n Redskins elect to do an onside kick reasoning that their lack of timeouts by this point would not be enough to stop any sort of drive. Forbath kicks it to Sam Acho who downs the ball. By this point, there is 2:17 left on the clock. The Redskins defense steps up for a final time and forces another three and out giving the Cousins the ball on the Redskins 14 yard line with 29 seconds left. \\n Offensive Personnel: 3 WR (Garcon, Roberts, Jackson) \u2013 1 TE (Reed) \u2013 1 RB (Helu) \\n Cousins in shotgun has Garcon on the left outside and a bunch formation consisting of Reed, Roberts and Jackson on the right. Roberts and Garcon both run deep in-routes, Jackson runs a go-route, while Helu and Reed release 5 yards off of the line of scrimmage and sit waiting for a checkdown pass. \\n [Here is the view of Cousins when he releases the ball]( \\n As you can see he actually has Garcon open if he throws the ball with enough velocity, but he simply underthrows it making it an easy pick-six for FS Johnson sitting underneath the route. Another option would be to release the ball to Reed on the checkdown and let him pick up some yards while getting out of bounds. If the pass was thrown properly, and Garcon caught the ball, he probably would have been tackled around Washington\u2019s 40 yard line, but still be in the middle of the field making the offense hurry up to the line to spike it. It is in my opinion, Cousins should have gone with one of the checkdowns letting them pick up a quick 20 yards due to the huge gap between them and the closest defender.']": "Based on the user's reddit posting history, it seems that the user is interested in the following areas:\n\n1.

I wanted to play with the vanilla decks with friends to see how well made they really were. Oh my lord, it was so much fun. It took us awhile to get the 5 of us and actually sit down to play it, but it was worth it. \\n We played Star format combined with EDH, and damn was it a lot of fun. For those who don't know, Star is a format that requires 5 players, and each with a mono-colored deck(I'm sure you could do this with Wedges or Shards, Guilds probably not so much). Each player picks a color to play as, and everyone must be a different color. Then, they all sit in the typical MtG color spread, WUBRG like so on the back of a Magic card. In order to win, a player must defeat his 2 enemies in any way that the Commander format allows. So if you're playing White, your enemies are Black and Red, and you will win once both of them are defeated. This means it is possible for there to be 2 winners in the game. \\n So for our game, I played the Green Commander deck, with Freyalise leading the charge. We all agreed to only use the planeswalker commanders, just because it felt right. And I started off strong. Turn 1 mana dork, turn 2 1-drop elf and Skullclamp and draw 2 extra cards from Skullclamp. From then on, my play was set. I started dropping Elves every turn and Freyalise as soon as possible to keep ahead of the curve. \\n It got really silly when I had Priest of Titania out to tap for G for every Elf on the battlefield. I used that to cast Sylvan Offering, with X for 13, and split between my allies(White and Red) the Treefolk and Elves tokens. There was so much mana for me to tap for, along with Wellwisher to just gain so much life. \\n My Blue enemy used Rite of Replication to copy my Priest so could have all the colorless mana to use, but after that never became much of a threat. Even with Teferi, there wasn't much happening on his side despite how many cards he drew unfortunately. My White ally used the 13 elves to his advantage to buff his Geist-Honored Monk and start beating on Black with all of his equipments. \\n Meanwhile, Red just didn't do much as he wasn't drawing the mana he needed. And even when he did get out Caged Sun, it would immediately get bounced. I'm pretty sure he casted it like, 3 times in our game. It was really unfortunate that he amounted to nothing really in the end, cause I know that deck can do crazy things on its own. \\n Black was holding its own with lifegain and Ob Nixilis, and kept repeatedly trying to slow me down with sacrificing and killing my creatures. But there was just too many Elves and my Wellwisher was beating out his lifegain. I eventually killed of Blue with a Creeperhulk buffed up from an Immaculate Magistrate and my army of Elves. It also had an Assault Suit on it, so I gave it to White on his next turn. \\n I reminded him that if killed Black right now, only I would win. So he had to work it out to kill both Red and Black at the same time for both of us to win. He did, even though he could just kill Red on his own, and I would kill Black with Overrun the next time. It was an amazingly fun game, and the Offerings are great Commander cards, especially in the Star format, where it's so easy to pick who gets the benefits. \\n So in the end, White and Green(me) won out at the same time, in the most glorious fashion. I honestly had hoped to use Titania's aspect of the deck, with all the land-based play and tokens, but Elves were just too strong to pass up in my opening hand.\", \"hot off the last episode, where the threat is effectively over(albeit some last-minute efforts) that leaves us questioning where we are going to next. i'm pretty sure OUAT wasn't officially renewed yet, but i'm sure it's a lock that we're getting another season, especially with the Season3 finale promo suggesting we're going to an entirely new location next time. \\n so with that, where would you like and where do you think we're off to next? we've had collectively, the Enchanted Forest encompassing most of our fairytale worlds, The Land Without Color, Neverland, Wonderland, and Oz. we can kind of count Agrabah from OUATinWonderland. (if i've forgotten any, please let me know) \\n do you think we will go back to Wonderland? or will the group actually end in Oz for a new arc? it's hard to see where any of this go, as at this point, we'll need a new villain or a way to make Rumple the villain again(which would be incredibly annoying) but i hope we get a new villain with a new location. \\n realistically, i don't have a clue. Atlantis would be annoying to deal with, but it seems most probable as we've met Ursula once and she seems to be a force to be reckoned with. and i'm sure they'd like to have more Ariel on screen. \\n not most likely or even realistically, but Star Wars would be interesting and definitely something i'd be hyped about. but with Star Wars VII on its way, i would either Disney wants to not do that ever so they don't confuse idiots, or it's something they'd really want to help promote it.\", \"now, i've thought it about this for a bit. remember when Oda said that he originally planned for the series to last for only 5 years in manga form? but then said he was having so much fun with it, he decided to make it last longer. \\n now, i don't know when EXACTLY he decided to switch from 5 years to the length it is now, but if we look at what we have with the series, you would see that if the series had ended in the 5 year span he planned originally, it would be at the end of the Arabasta Saga. Now, why with a series that had the outset of the protaganist becoming the greatest figure in the world, the Pirate King, simply end so early in the middle of the Grand Line? \\n And even if Oda had decided to lengthen his series and then in turn expand the rest of the arcs, no way he could hope to get through the New World and find One Piece in any kind of timespan of 5 years. \\n To anybody who doesn't know, Oda also said along with extending the series than the originally planned 5 years, that he is also going to have the same ending he had already planned, that he already knows how he's going to end the whole series. So the question is, how could Luffy find One Piece and become the Pirate King if he doesn't end up in Raftel, where it supposedly is? One possible theory is that One Piece was originally in Arabasta, but that's very highly unlikely. \\n No, my theory is that the ending of the series will be the discovery of the Rio Poneglyph and the telling of the True History of the Void Century. If you think about it, that's what the Arabasta Saga was all about, Crocodile trying to find that Poneglyph(although, to find Pluton, not the True History) and Robin says her journey will end at Raftel, where she will most likely find it after discovering the rest of the Poneglyphs. \\n Now, the exact details of the Rio Poneglyph may not be the same as they would have been with the 5 year timespan, but I am sure the essence of it will be the same. I mean, the Void Century was essentially non-existent until Robin joined the group and started explaining her research on it. I bet the whole content and idea of the Void Century was created AFTER Oda decided to extend the series, but still planned to use the contents of the Poneglyph as the ending of the series, then leave Luffy's journey to become the Pirate King open to people's imagination. \\n Now, I realize there are some gaps in this theory, but I generally tried to cover them all.\", \"so i just beat the game today(would've been sooner if my sister wasn't also playing at the same time) and i must say, the whole last sequence was exciting. after completing the Sky Keep, i was wondering where this was going exactly. \\n when i got to the Horde Battle, i was so excited that i would actually face waves of enemies on my way down to Ghirahim. i only wish that the mobs were stronger that they weren't OHKO most of the time, but it wasn't that big of a deal to me. \\n Then the final Ghirahim battle was good fun, made it exciting to cause all those fatal blows to him from 100 meters in the air. Then they finally had the Dead Man's Volley that i was missing throughout the game, and he went down pretty fast cause of that. When he brought out his berserker sword, i had a little trouble cuz he kept switching stances, but i finally took it slow and took him down. \\n then came the final battle with Demise. i do like his character and Ghirahim's, and the way they interacted for their few moments cause it showed how differently Ghirahim and Demise were as sword and master to Fi and Link. and i love Demise's pompous attitude towards Link and it makes sense cause this is the first 'legend' to happen so far in the storyline, i guess. Demise doesn't have any other previous encounters like Ganondorf does, and he knows it. he made numerous notes about how so many humans were insects in front of him. \\n and the final battle, i had the most fun with. the first part went fast when i just kept attacking him and shielding his attacks in quick succession. it made me really use my shield(which i already did a lot in the game) for the second part since there was the problem of his ELECTRIC EVIL MASTER SWORD. but i learned the pattern, and was able to take him down within the minute then. \\n this was the kind of final epic sword battle that Skyward Sword needed and deserved, one that didn't just make you swing wildly til they went down. and all the events that happened in between, and those awesome Groose moments(renaming the franchise 'The Legend of Groose?' genius) and of course, the revelation that would become Ganon's birth. then the final moment where Link actually makes a choice in what he does was heartwarming(watched a lot of Lost, i see a lot of conflicts of Destiny vs Free Will everywhere)\", 'so basically, i had posted this in the main Doctor Who subreddit, and somebody told me i should xpost it here, so enjoy the wall of text! \\n \\'so, just finished watching the new episode. Amazing. Absolutely amazing. I can safely say now that Clara is the one companion I absolutely love and is definitely my favorite now.

I had dealt with that disappointment cause I favor an overarching story arc in the background, like Bad Wolf or the Cracks. \\n but no, in \"The Snowmen,\" it returned at the moment when Clara kissed the Doctor and you see the lights quickly flicker. and now, in \"The Bells of Saint John,\" there are a few instances of the lights, but all of these seem to be part of the plot and not subtle anymore. Such as Miss Kizlet having the lights going out in London and all the lights in Clara\\'s neighborhood turning on to scare the couple. Then again, I guess somehow to show the use of the WiFi, the lights in the coffee place flickered whenever Miss Kizlet hacks one of the people to speak to the Doctor. \\n Does this mean that the Great Intelligence has been somehow watching the Doctor throughout this whole season? Or is there something even bigger at hand? Or maybe I\\'m just reading too much into this now, hoping for something out of it. Please let me know what you think, cause the flickering lights was a big point of discussion among my friends, and we always enjoy picking apart Moffatt\\'s brain.', 'so first off to say, that was a very good season finale, one of the best episodes this season. even if this season was lacking. \\n life-changing events are happening for everyone, all at once. Robin and Barney are getting married, Lily\\'s moving to Rome for a year, Ted just decided to move to Chicago, and Marshall just became a judge of NY. and for all of us, we got to meet the Mother. \\n but let\\'s think about this, and the premise of the show when it started. HIMYM\\'s hook, at first, was always that we wanted to meet the Mother, because that\\'s the story we\\'re being told. but then that changed, and it instead became the story of Ted\\'s life, making meeting the mother all an afterthought(or forethought) \\n and when you think about it, actually meeting the Mother(for us) was never going to be that exciting, at all. i\\'ll hand it to the HIMYM team, they made the buildup to it exciting in the last few moments, but really think about it. while we have everything Ted\\'s told us about her, we don\\'t know her AT ALL. she was never going to be someone we knew, someone we\\'ve come to cared about personally after 8 years. \\n this show was always about Ted meeting the Mother, and what it will do for him. and it\\'d be wrong not to end it with the best moment of his life. that\\'s why, I (cautiously) speculate(and open to criticism and thoughts) that our final season may somehow be within the next 56-72 hours of his life, entailing from the end of \"Something New\"s ending, through the wedding, and to the moment at the train station when Ted meets the Mother. \\n of course, there\\'s many reasons why this shouldn\\'t, couldn\\'t, or wouldn\\'t happen. but that doesn\\'t mean there aren\\'t reasons it should, could, and would happen. let\\'s look at our life-changing events. \\n starting with Robin and Barney. they\\'re getting married. whether they actually do or not is unknown. but damned if they don\\'t, because they need to. that\\'s what this show demands for happiness in this world. and they were really made to be perfect for each other, so i\\'ll continue on as if they do. but what\\'s going to happen after their wedding? their honeymoon, their adjustments to life. anything could happen. being together and marriage are two completely different things, and that will change things, very drastically. a bit too much for this show to handle. \\n and now Lily and Marshall. it\\'s hard to do them both together and separate, but let\\'s take a whack at it. with Lily  planning  on moving to Rome, and Marshall accepting the Judge position, we\\'re at a very interesting crossroads. Marshall can\\'t and won\\'t back out of his decision now, and Lily can\\'t and won\\'t back out of her decision now. these are not only their jobs on the line, but their dreams. this is everything they\\'ve ever hoped for, and they\\'re both finally about to get it, but not together. we know from Future Ted they are still together, but what happens in this year in between? \\n when this confrontation does happen, i can see it ending something like this: Lily and Marshall both realize they need to do this for the next year. Lily\\'s going to Rome for the year, and Marshall\\'s staying in NY as a judge. as for Marvin, that\\'s really up in the air at this point, and irrelevant, although i can think of some interesting things for him. they will come to a mutual understanding of each other, because they were made perfectly for each other, and will be happy for each other and agree to meet up again a year later(and Christmas) to pick up where they left off. \\n i\\'m doing Ted last, because there may be information i\\'m forgetting and don\\'t want to be too concrete about it. but Ted is moving to Chicago, sold his apartment and house. but we all know that he lives in that same house with his family, so what gives? maybe he does move to Chicago after meeting the Mother. it\\'s hard to say, but maybe they both decide to live in Chicago for the next year and then decide to move back after Lily comes back and Robin and Barney are comfortable with each other. \\n this would all be perfect to end with, because finally, everyone will be happy in their own way. and to be different, this show will end with everyone parting ways, but we all know for sure they end up back together, plus one and happily. \\n now for the creatives team, this would give them the chance to do something different. setting a whole season in the span of around 72 hours would be challenging(i mean,  24  did a day, but that was different) and it\\'d set for very different ways to portray a sitcom. it may be laden with flashbacks, or something else entirely new they\\'ve thought of that we\\'ve never seen before. but either way, it\\'d give us a chance to flesh all of our characters out once last time before the big departure. and HIMYM likes to do things differently in their own way. \\n i\\'m very sorry for being too much with my writing, creating a giant-ass wall of text, but i like very much to speak my mind and ideas. if you took the time to read all of this, please let me know your thoughts. please and thank you.', 'so, just finished watching the new episode.

Just started really playing it a lot recently and unlocked the Keeper. I just wanted to share a couple of my thoughts on him so far. \\n For starters I realize that the Keeper is not meant to BE Greed but his character emulates Greed in many ways. Upon playing him the first time I was somewhat disappointed to see that unlike in the character select image and the floor transition screen depiction, his actual sprite does not have the visible noose around his neck. A minor cosmetic but still was one of the things I was expecting while trying to unlock him. I also thought the triple shot starter item was not only a really cool and unique character element, but also a really cool way of again giving the vibe of playing as Greed. I think that this should have been taken a step further with yet another cosmetic by having the Keeper start the game with blood (red) tears. \\n I also (probably like many) considered the possibility of the Keeper beginning runs with Transcendence. This of course takes away a little bit of the challenge from the character but is it too much? I personally think it wouldn\\'t really matter one way or the other. He doesn\\'t start with it, then he is more challenging of a character. If he did start with it I think it would make him more \"fun.\" Both are valuable in their own ways. Though if he were ever to get Transcendence as a starter then he should have a visual exception in that his body doesn\\'t disappear. \\n I think the coin health bar is a really neat and unique idea. When I initially wasn\\'t seeing any heart drops I kind of thought they were just removed from the pickup pool and randomly replaced with another pickup but upon reading about the character on the wiki for the first time after exposing myself to him I found out about the blue fly system. The idea that the hearts were removed from the pool entirely I thought fit the theme of the Keeper in that less heart spawns means more money spawns (sacrificing health for wealth). But after I learned about the blue fly system I was satisfied because the flies still fit the character theme considering the Greed themed enemies tend to have eternal flies quite often. \\n I also began to think about what it would be like if other playable characters based on the Seven Deadly Sins mini-bosses were implemented. A pink playable Lust character who lays creep and has a melee focus. A Wrath character who has a lot of bomb items. Some cool things could be done with all of the mini-bosses. Most difficult one for me imagine playable is Envy. I\\'d appreciate comments with other ideas like these. I think it\\'d be fun to read people\\'s brainstorming. \\n The final thought I\\'ll share for now is that with the introduction of yet another character with a non-standard skin tone I was really awakened to the reality of how many items change the facial pigmentation and make the gray body of the Keeper, the blue body of ???, etc look silly with peach colored facial pigmentation. It doesn\\'t bother me when items like common cold that make sense to change the face color are picked up but some items, rather than just change the facial expression, change the entire character\\'s head to be the default Isaac skin tone unnecessarily. It would be a nice visual to when possible keep a character\\'s original face and body color except in the case that an item makes sense to change the color like common cold or lord of the pit.', 'I\\'m pretty sure Eden is one of the community favorites to play because random starting items are just plain fun. Playing Eden costs an Eden token though, and for good reason. If the tokens were gone then provided you unlocked all the items you could easily finish your collection page just by holding down the \"R\" key. On the other hand I feel like limiting the play on a character that is fun in any way is a little bit of a bad idea. My solution to this is that as one of the rewards for completing AB+ with 100%, Eden tokens should be abolished. You can\\'t cheat the collection page if it\\'s already done right? Plus it would be a suitable reward for someone with nothing else left to unlock or acquire.', \"So my PS4 is regularly deciding not to output signal to my monitor for seemingly no reason. I saw plenty of videos that talked about faulty HDMI ports hanging out of the PS4. My port appears normal. I've fixed the problem multiple times by sheer luck but it always returns. I once fixed it just by switching the ends of the HDMI so that the end in the PS4 was in the monitor and vice versa. I've tried holding the button on the console to reset the video settings even though my monitor is native 1920x1080. I have it plugged into my HDMI switch box along with my PC and I've tried every port including directly in the monitor. The light on the box showing an input won't even light up where the PS4 is plugged in suggesting the console is putting out no signal at all.

I have no idea how to fix this or what might be wrong and I've had the system for more than a year so I know Sony will probably end up jerking me around if I call their support line and tell me I gotta pay 180 and might not get my own system back if they still operate anything like they did when my PS3 got YLOD. Does anyone know how I can fix this headache because I didn't pay 400 for a brick.\", \"Wasn't sure where the best place to post this was but basically I have a game (Terraria) that has recently implemented controller support. I preferred the control scheme I used before which involved using JoyToKey to emulate my controller into keyboard and mouse inputs. I am using a PS3 controller with the SCP driver that basically makes it work as an Xbox360 controller. If I try to use my old controls the game detects both native controller input and keyboard and mouse input at the same time. I can work around this if my controller is assigned to controller 2 rather than controller 1. The problem is this involves me uninstalling and reinstalling my driver every time and making my girlfriend's controller assigned as controller 1 and mine as 2, and then again when I'm done to make my controller controller 1 again. Is there some way to assign my controller to be controller 2 in Windows without having another controller put in?\", \"So I have played every Mariokart game and own most. I've only played Mariokart 8 a few times but all of them made me think it's a bad direction for the series. Before I say the following I want to make clear that I realize this is Mariokart and the whole last gets the better items to catch up thing is a staple of the genre and probably even a necessity. That being said they really killed a lot of the 1st place racer's ability to hold their position in 8. It's bad enough you often get stuff like coins as an item pickup offering no defensive or offensive advantage whatsoever, but on top of that removing the ability to stockpile an extra item to hang onto in the case you pick up a dud item? It just seems like although the series was never meant to be a perfectly balanced competitive game experience, the 8th installment just went out of its way to make each race more of a crapshoot than previous installments. Personally I liked 7 a lot and thought the worst part of it was the coins affecting kart speed. Other than that though the game played pretty well. The coins actually made it a little too easy to hold a lead but I think without that the game would have been in just about the right place. Do other people here think 8 made some poor changes to the series or is my opinion generally in the minority?\", \"Monstro is like one of the poster boys of Isaac. Think he deserves to be a character in the upcoming DLC. My idea is Isaac without a body, like if you use the hanged man, starts with Monstro's lung. The main uniqueness to the character would be instead of normal movement every move is a jump just like if you were constantly using How to Jump. He could also start with a new Monstro activated collectible. Upon use makes Isaac leap high into the air disappearing from the screen leaving a shadow that can be controlled by the player before Isaac returns with a slam that damages enemies and creates a large burst of tears that go high. Also since the character's movement kind of mimics the How to Jump item, then when you actually get the item one might think it'd be useless but it could allow you to use How to Jump while you are already in the air to change direction, increasing evasiveness.\\nThe rest of his stats (health, damage, etc) should just be adjusted so that the character is well balanced given the rest of his abilities.\\nNOTE: I searched before posting this and found nothing that was this idea, only a mod for a character starting with Monstro's lung and How to Jump. Sorry if this is a duplicate.\", \"Before the update with controller support I used joytokey to play with a controller and I found the game very playable. Literally the only shortcoming was aiming projectile ranged and magic weapons because rather than 1 to 1 aiming with the right analog stick I had to push the cursor across the screen with the stick. This wasn't a huge deal and I've still gotten 600+ hours of enjoyment out of this game. Now that controller support has been added I can't use joytokey because the simultaneous controller and keyboard inputs confuse the game and don't work correctly. However, given that the controller support update included the cursor style that allows me to aim directly with the stick my problem would be solved if it weren't for the fact that I don't like the rest of the controller style play that was implemented. So I'm looking for a mod or way that I can disable controller support from the game but retain that direct analog stick cursor style only when I am wielding a projectile weapon and am not in the inventory menu. Does anyone know if this exact thing can be executed or exists, and if it doesn't can someone who make's mods implement this for me?

After LMoP we were discussing what to run next when one of the players said he had an idea for an adventure and that he\u2019d like to run it with my help. I said \u201cSure!\" \\n It\u2019s a Seaborne/Pirate/Lost Treasure adventure that takes place in Neverwinter and along the Sword Coast and out at sea. Mostly I run the sessions, and the player and I collaborate on the adventure structure beforehand. He occasionally runs an NPC or monster. He is also playing a character in the party (which may be a mistake\u2026). \\n He has some great ideas about the adventure and I am trying to help him refine them and make them playable. He seems to have the problem a lot of first time DMs have (and that I had): he has a specific story/scene in mind and wants the players to conform to it. \\n For example, we were talking about a mission the party has been given to scout out a blockade of Pirates around Neverwinter harbor. I was encouraging him to think about what that might be like, how to prepare for the scouting. He said: \\n > Maybe one member of the party sneaks up to the pirate ship in a boat with muffled oars and climbs up to peek over the gunwales. He sees a bunch of pirates having a crazy dance party. They all turn and see him and he sheepishly says \u201cOh, sorry\u2026\u201d and gets back in his boat and rows away. \\n This is his sense of humor, and when he was playing in LMoP he did a lot of crazy antics (rolling on the floor to try to knock someone down; dropping his sword to pick up a chair leg and hit someone with it; dropping a powerful magic item he had just gotten away from a villain and running out of the room screaming, etc.). It was fun when he did these things in game, but now he wants the players to do those kinds of things for his story. It\u2019s like he has a movie in his head he wants the players to conform to. \\n He also wants to have stuff happen that is disconnected from anything: a bunch of skeletons attack the party out of nowhere, etc. I am trying to encourage him to have stuff be connected to a larger story, or have a reason for being in the adventure. I  know  some of the other players won\u2019t appreciate the randomness he is proposing. The overall story ( his  story) is serious and dangerous and I don\\'t think it fits well with the wackiness he wants to add to it. Am I being too controlling? I want to mentor him but I\\'m finding myself wanting to take his awesome ideas and make them fit better into the story.', 'Today I started running HotDQ for three 7th graders; my son and two of his friends. \\n One is new to our group and to D&D, the other two have been playing with me for about a year. I have posted before about my players being too timid, but it has swung the other way... \\n Greenest in Flames \\n I set the stage: coming over a rise and seeing the town of Greenest with a large number of kobolds and cultists, etc. raiding the town and a blue dragon attacking the keep. \\n Their first reaction: RUN into town and KILL all those kobolds. I was at a loss. The adventure as written assumes PCs will approach with trepidation and caution since there are a hundred (?) raiders. Two hundred maybe? It doesn\\'t really have a suggestion for how to run it if the players rush into town looking for a fight. \\n So, trying to avoid railroading or quashing their excitement, I said when they got down to the town they were entering via a road and could see a band of 6 kobolds and a human in robes looting one of the buildings closest to them. But I also said they could hear screams and see other looting and general mayhem, these were just the closest group of raiders, and that if they attacked them, it seemed likely they might attract the attention of others. \\n The player new to D&D said \"I don\\'t care, I\\'m going into attack!\" and ran headlong into a fight. The other two players followed and they all rolled really well and finished off the kobold band and the acolyte pretty handily and quickly. I did have the acolyte ask who they were and what they were doing there, seeing as they looked more like mercenaries than townspeople, and they just flat out told him before killing him. \\n Then I had the family appear, being chased by more kobolds, and ask to be taken to the Keep. The party just went after the kobolds and didn\\'t care about the family much. Eventually I got them to go to the Keep (\"Please help us get to the keep!\"), but they just wanted to battle their way though as many enemies as they could. \\n I think this comes from playing D&D inspired video games, where the point is kind of to run in and kill (right?). But I\\'m not sure how to adjust for this or discourage this. The second major fight, with a group of 6 cultists, did result in them each getting dropped to 2-3 HP, and this is part of what got them to actually go to the Keep. \\n So I guess I\\'m looking for advice opposite what I asked previously. This whole Chapter 1 is pretty rough and challenging for level 1 PCs, but they don\\'t seem to see the danger.

Played in an adventure they have already been the DM for? How do you do it? \\n It's one thing to play in character and separate my knowledge from my character's knowledge. But how do I know if my character might look in that location where something valuable is hidden if I already know it is there. There are several things in Lost Mines that are pretty cool items you won't find unless you dig around in the right spots. \\n In other words, I as a player might not think to have my character look in the brazier, for example. But I can't know for sure since I already KNOW there's something in the brazier.\", 'I\\'m currently trying to staff a pirate transfer point, a place hidden on an island where pirates built a set of docks and quarters and which they are using as a supply drop for their nearby blockade of the PCs home port. \\n I\\'m DMing for 14 year olds, and some of them feel a little odd about killing humans. They have fought pirates and then reported to me afterwards that it was weird to kill other \"people\" even though those people were trying to kill them. I understand and want to keep it fun for them so... \\n I can push the moral grey area and make them make choices about killing vs. capturing  human  pirates.  Or  I can make it easier on them and make the things they are fighting more clearly \"other\" and \"evil\" like goblins or orcs. When the creatures are described as monsters (instead of people who have made poor choices ;-)) their qualms about killing them diminish greatly. \\n So my question is about finding monsters (similar to goblins or orcs) that an organized pirate blockade might have working at their hidden supply base. My idea is there is one human pirate captain running the place, and the rest is operated under his command by some enslaved (or well paid?) monsters. I\\'ve already introduced the idea that monsters are involved in the pirate blockade (in fact there\\'s one ship that is all monsters), but I don\\'t know what to use for the monsters pressed into service for the supply depot. \\n Yes, goblins or hobgoblins might make sense (though I\\'m not sure why the hobgoblins would be willing), but the players have faced goblins and hobgoblins many times before (Lost Mine), and I want something new. I just browsed through the MM looking and found most 1/4 and 1/2 monsters don\\'t seem to be likely to work for pirates. \\n \\n Orcs are too independent, I think.

If the \"golden rule\" is that everyone is there to have fun, then its the responsibility of the outnumbered party to make concessions.  Its simple utilitarianism. \\n If you\\'ve ever been a part of the game where the DM had this \"super awesome story\" and everyone was really into it, it probably wasn\\'t an accident.  The DM had a few seeds in the beginning but carefully watched the player\\'s reactions and kept good track of every player\\'s motivations and used all of that to guide the growth of that story. \\n That DM observed and  knew  that the Paladin had a love interest in the Duke\\'s daughter. \\n That DM asked questions and  knew  the Rogue thought the leader of the local thieve\\'s guild seemed like he was up to no good (more so than normal anyway). \\n That DM listened to in character and out of character conversation amongst the party and  knew  the party was curious as to the source of the Necromancer\\'s power and that the Wizard had a vested interest in putting a stop to it all. \\n So that DM used all of that knowledge to give the players what they wanted without having to directly ask for it.  The DM shaped the whole story, perhaps the entire world, to meet the expectations of their players and to provide the drama and incentive they needed to keep coming. \\n Tabletop storytelling is an amazing medium for entertainment.  Imagine producing a show or video game where the audience sees things unfold, practically in real time, and are able to (directly and indirectly) give feedback to the producers and directors.  With tabletop RPGs that  is  possible, but a lot of DMs aren\\'t listening. \\n I swear my biggest pet peeve in the world is related to this.  See the \"legendary DMs\" we all remember will occasionally ask for written backstories and character motivations from their players.  What they do with that is shape their story and their world  around  that backstory to keep the players interested.  Nobody really talks about this stuff though, so things shifted.  It became en vogue to ask players for 10 page backstories without knowing  why.

All of them do.  The party\\'s collective background, that the DM asked for, sit there and collect dust while the conductor piles us all aboard the railroad express with a one-way ticket to checking  out, fiddling with our phones, and trying to stay interested in a story we\\'re not particularly invested in. \\n Don\\'t get me wrong.  Its OK to railroad the players from time to time, but the tracks should go straight through their hearts.  If you\\'re doing it right you  can  railroad the players because you\\'re going towards their motivations, you\\'re holding their wants hostage, and you\\'re stabbing at drama they\\'re genuinely interested in. \\n If you\\'ve got a billion level super dungeon but your players would rather be caught up in political intrigue and check out the second they step in the dungeon, then you\\'ve got two options:  Shift the goals of the game/story towards political intrigue, or have bored players. \\n If you\\'ve got a game of thrones but the players just want to kick in doors and murderhobo some shit, then you\\'ve got two options:  Turn the game towards action, or have bored players. \\n If the players aren\\'t interested in a particular story thread or want to pursue something else, drop it.  Show me a \"legendary DM\" and I\\'ll show you someone who for every cool story they told, ten interesting story threads ended up crumpled at the bottom of the waste basket. \\n Ask bloody questions! \\n You should read the Dungeon World rulebook, even if you don\\'t want to run Dungeon World.  Cover to cover.  Yes your brain is absorbing rules you may never use, but you\\'ll also be absorbing useful lessons on gamemastering.  Almost every page reiterates the same message, that DW (and, I feel, TTRPGs in general) is a  conversation.   Storytelling is about people, as a group, coming together to tell an awesome tale.  It isn\\'t Mr Toad\\'s Wild Ride. \\n Ask your players questions.  Don\\'t directly ask them \"what do you want out of this game,\" that\\'ll never end well because it\\'ll be seen as pandering.  Find out what their characters are thinking, what their motivations are, what they\\'re worried about.  Then  use it. \\n \"Hey, I noticed Ragnar spent a lot of time at the feast talking to the Prince.  What\\'s Ragnar\\'s interest there?\" \\n \"Sova seemed particularly brutal when dealing with those Orcs.  More than usual.  Does she especially hate Orcs or is there something else going on?\" \\n \"Karmen keeps asking a lot of questions about those red-bladed swords.  What\\'s her interest there?\" \\n It accomplishes two things.  First, it gives the player a bit of spotlight.  They get to talk about what is going on inside their character\\'s head and everyone else gets to listen.  It makes the player and character a larger part of the story. \\n Second, it gives the DM information.   Use it.   Make plans to do something centered around that information.  Either play it out directly as they say or subvert it. \\n Does Ragnar think the Prince is involved with the deathcult somehow?  Well, the Prince  wasn\\'t  involved with them, but the players don\\'t know that and giving Ragnar\\'s player that pay off will be worth something.  It\\'ll get him invested.  Maybe Ragnar is right, maybe the Prince  is  too nice.  Maybe it  is  all a facade.  Maybe he  is  involved in the deathcult as a means to overthrow his father and seize the throne.  Ragnar\\'s player is clearly interested in both the deathcult  and  the prince.  It doesn\\'t matter that it was only planned to be a small story segment, if you ride it out as something bigger Ragnar will feel much more invested in the outcome. \\n Sova  does  hate Orcs.  They killed her father while he was defending the mountainhome.  Probe a bit more.  Ask about her family and her ancestral home, maybe try to tie a storyline back there.  Give her an awkward hero\\'s homecoming, returning to a home that has changed drastically and is maybe desperate and in danger or maybe just has moved on without her.  Maybe, if you\\'re feeling generous, a genuine hero\\'s homecoming should she deserve it. \\n Karmen is worried about the red-bladed swords being evil.  Maybe subvert it, twist it around a bit.  Perhaps they  are  evil, but are being produced as a sort of deal with the devil.  Maybe a fallen Paladin has dishonored her code but not given up her cause.  She is having these weapons commissioned to better destroy the demons that are ravaging the land, no matter what cost to her own soul. \\n Respond simply.  \"Interesting.\"  \"Cool.\"  \"Oh, I didn\\'t know that about Sova.\"  Then take notes and make plans. \\n Your players will tell you everything they\\'re interested in, it won\\'t come off as direct pandering, and they\\'ll be happy for the opportunity to have been asked in the first place. \\n Traps \\n Traditional traps are fucking boring.  They\\'re binary skill checks with (generally) fairly severe consequences.  Roll to spot them or take damage.  Roll to disarm or take damage.  Terrible.  To make matters worse, there isn\\'t a single fun outcome with their implementation.  If the party doesn\\'t have a Rogue, they\\'re boned and lose resources.  If the party does have a Rogue then the rogue makes a couple uninspired skill rolls and completely trivializes the problem.  The Rogue generally doesn\\'t even have fun disarming the damn things. \\n If you\\'re going to use traps, don\\'t design anything like what is designed in the book (pit trap.  Spot DC 22, disarm DC 27) and instead come up with a puzzle.  Make the trap something painfully obvious to spot but which will require thinking and teamwork to overcome. \\n Combat woes \\n Dungeons and Dragons combat (especially 3.5/PF) can become a bit of a tedious slog.  Here are the badguys, you guys are over there, ok fight. \\n Then that \"ok fight\" takes an hour a round for what boils down to really slow paced, not particularly interesting strategic combat.  4th is a bit better about it because it introduces more options and 5th is (imo) a lot better because the rounds zip by a lot faster. \\n I\\'m a pretty dedicated player, I was playing D&D before I was old enough to discover girls and have 20 years under my belt, but if it is a half hour between each time I get to go then I am going to zone out.  You can\\'t build interest or suspense in what amounts to the opposite of speed chess. \\n If the players aren\\'t interested in combat you\\'ll just have to switch things up.  I\\'d really recommend 5th for its simplification of combat as it speeds things up considerably.  Maybe drop the battlemat for a more narrative style, maybe just keep combats short. \\n Or change how things work.  Instead of \"thats them, that\\'s you, ok fight\" start small and add complications as things go.  Ambush from the sides, or attack them on interesting terrain.  Something. \\n If they players just aren\\'t interested in combat then I hate to say it but perhaps D&D isn\\'t the best system for your group.  Maybe try another system where killing things isn\\'t 90% of the way to advance the characters and story.  (Sure you  could  run a noncombat game in D&D, you could also drive in a nail with a brick.  If there is a better tool for the job, you should probably think about giving that tool a shot). \\n there is no', 'Unwired pg 13 talks pretty extensively about Social Networks in shadowrun.  They are explicitly mentioned as \"thorns in the side\" of the Corporations but their broad appeal and decentralized nature make them impossible to shut down. \\n So while AresSpace might exist as a place for Ares personnel  only  to communicate and hang out, larger global social networks definitely exist and are very popular.  Unwired lists several examples. \\n I-Sez is a very popular global meta-facebook.  It tracks someones ratings and status among all of their individual social networks with a goal of \u201ccreating an open society that rewards strong ethics, kindness, and metahuman connections.\u201d  One site where you could (to use modern examples) check a person\\'s Facebook status/friends, twitter followers/tweets, youtube videos/comments, LlinkedIn... etc.  All of it. \\n ShadowSea is LinkedIn for Shadowrunners.  I wish I was making this up.  Unwired pg 15.  Has a rep system in place to check out other runners or \"service providers.\" \\n Unwired pg 27,  Sousveillance: who will watch the watchers  mentions Diaries, a popular network where users are outfitted and recording 24/7/365.  The passage discusses people using networks like this to attempt to police the police or corporate powers themselves.  The corps have a lot of pull to control conventional media, and the sousveillance networks have started cropping up specifically to counter that.  These sorts of networks can break news of corporate corruption to millions of people before any damage control is even possible. \\n The Corps of course have their own spin departments, and it wouldn\\'t surprise me if they didn\\'t have their own \"Counter-sousveillance\" initiatives.  People whose specific cushy job is to work for the corp and keep Diary profile running about how its all sunshine and lollipops, but I digress a bit. \\n My point is, there explicitly  are  global social networks and they have talked quite in depth about what that means in an age where average people are at least casually connected to the matrix their entire lives and have cameras and powerful computers on them (or stuffed in their heads). \\n The counter to this isn\\'t pretending these things shouldn\\'t or wouldn\\'t exist.  That\\'s nonsense.  Of course they do. \\n The counter is found in SR4A.  Pg 43,  Holes in the system.   Absolutely integral piece of fluff in a post Matrix 2.0 game.  It is the only thing that makes the game not completely, by default, so black of a trenchcoat that no one will survive the long haul, hell its the only piece of writing that makes Shadowrun as a game even  possible  when everything and everywhere is pretty constantly recorded. \\n >There is simply too much data out there and it is growing by the nanosecond. \\n The passage continues of course, I wont post the whole thing here, but it is vital to the game\\'s very existence. \\n There  are  social networks.  There  are  billions of people using them.  There  are  drones in the sky and cameras on every street.  There  are  cyber eyes recording in every crowd, probably lots of them. \\n And its all there on the matrix. All of it.   ALL  of it.  This is life now.  Drowning in an ocean of data that grows exponentially. \\n That\\'s the only thing that keeps Shadowrun even remotely believable in this super surveillance state.  Countries watching, corps watching, people watching.  Everyone watching and recording each other in an endless circlejerk of data.  It\\'s impossible to hack and edit away  all  of it.  The only thing that makes even the most basic milk-run remotely possible is that there is simply too much data to even attempt to go through. \\n Your salvation, as a GM, is that this can be a double edged sword. \\n Players want to hack his Facebook?  Good luck.  These people were  born  on Facebook.  Every friend, every passing acquaintance is on there.  Probably has thousands of them from all over the world and keeping in touch is a thought away.  Their PANs are running every waking minute.   Normal  people are tweeting and blogging and playing a game and listening to music and watching porn all at the same time while walking down the street.  While being bombarded with advertisements and other crap. \\n Trying to dig through this guy live tweeting, or worse, live video diarying his  entire life  is not as easy as what we know to be \"I stalk him on facebook.\"  Digging through his contacts is a swarm of information and people of varying importance. \\n Definitely possible, but if you don\\'t like the idea and want to press the issue you can at least enforce a few rolls out of it to make the legwork harder. \\n Then that becomes the Shadowrun stakeout.  Two runners in a van outside of a guy\\'s house eating junk food for three days straight, only rather than looking out the window watching him they\\'re in the back of the van staring at AR displays trying to parse through the mark\\'s ridiculous data pit of a life for something relevant.', 'I have a sort of recurring character I bring about from time to time.  If I\\'m in need of a character, on the spot, there aren\\'t any obvious deficiencies in the party, and I just want to have a good time I\\'ll bring him out. \\n It\\'s never the  same  character.  The same name, personality archetype, and habits.  The character is also always a little folk (usually a gnome) and has to be an upfront physical powerhouse of some sort. \\n Throughout my time I\\'ve collected a list of titles (which will take a couple minutes to list off), and quite a few \"tales of adventure.\"  He is a self proclaimed brilliant military strategist and master of all manner of skills and arts.  The character also fancies himself a perfect chivalrous gentleman. \\n Chivalrous, not so much.  The character is Chaotic Good.  He\\'s is too lazy, too impatient, and has too short of an attention span to be chivalrous.  He enjoys the  concept  of chivalry, but in practice he\\'s not much for it outside of the bizarre concept that he should loudly challenge people to duels for besmirching his honor.  He\\'ll take oaths or make vows, and is sometimes good to fulfil them so long as they don\\'t take much time and he doesn\\'t get distracted. \\n His \"brilliant military strategy\" is mainly just him winning more fights than he loses.  Fairly hard line chaotic, he doesn\\'t have the patience or discipline to make ornate plans.  When others make plans, he usually goes off script (and then loudly boasts about his brilliant improvisational skills).  His favorite tactic for infiltrating an enemy stronghold is to simply knock on the door, plan B is breaking the door down one way or another. \\n Gentleman is another weak area.  While he does demand his morning tea and nicer spirits when they are available, he has developed a weakness for Human and Elvish women.  As he puts it, when you\\'re three feet tall you can\\'t help but fetishize long legs.  Fortunately, while he is not a gentleman, he is not a creep and has a good sense of humor about the poor girls who aren\\'t smart enough to be attracted to him. \\n He is not a master in all manner of skills and arts, but he has so far proven to be a master bullshitter which is close enough.  Most recently he argued a murder case in defense of a party member wherein he declared himself the prosecution, declared that the town\\'s poor policing skills were on trial as the defendant, and then demanded that the whole trial be governed by Maritime Law (despite neither he, the character, nor I, the player, knowing a damn thing about Maritime Law).  The case was derailed and inevitably dismissed. \\n Finally the stories and titles.  A lot of them were genuinely \"earned\" in the character\\'s previous incarnations.  The rest of them were, and perhaps will always be, complete bullshit.  Absolutely no way of knowing which is which, but I continue to collect the stories/titles and bullshit others.  I\\'m sure that not even he knows which ones are the real ones and which ones are fantasy anymore, or if it even matters. \\n Despite all of this he\\'s extremely friendly, will do anything for a comrade, and is willing to adventure for adventure\\'s sake.', 'Iomedae is a very interesting LG deity, she\\'s extremely level headed as a goddess and a warrior and should theoretically produce much less \"typical paladin problems\" among her followers. \\n All in all, she\\'s a pretty easy deity to keep happy and is practically the Stand Your Ground Law of Paladin deities.  She still has her rules, but they\\'re much more in line with the lifestyle of a warrior, soldier, or adventurer (and she should be!  She has been all three herself!). \\n If you\\'re ever in doubt, 3 D\\'s. \\n Diplomacy \\n Defend Yourself \\n Demand Surrender \\n There are very few situations that can end poorly for a Paladin of Iomedae if they follow the 3 D\\'s.  [It goes a little something like this:]( \\n Your party was following a lead on a quest and was set upon by a, presumably, hostile force.  Realistically there are a  lot  of hostile forces in the world of Pathfinder, and not all of them are bad or evil; they\\'re just people defending themselves or following orders and they might not even know who you are.   Diplomacy   can end an awful lot of potential conflicts before they start by firmly stating who you are and what you are about.  Sounds like you had a \"talker\" so you should be alright there. \\n The hostile force attacked.   You defend yourself.   That\\'s pretty cut and dry. \\n I would be remiss if I didn\\'t talk a bit about the concept of Escalation of Force.  The general concept is to use the least amount of force to resolve a situation.  It generally means to respond with equal or slightly greater force than your opponent. \\n If a drunk hits you with a barstool and you cut him in half, you\\'re the asshole. \\n In this case a couple of grown combatants attacked you with lethal force, you responded in kind.  Thats fine.  Murdering their entire village, to include their noncombatants, would make you an asshole (looking at you Anakin). \\n Regardless, you were attacked and exorcised your right to respond. \\n Now you\\'re questioning whether what you did was right.  Hypothetically, the church might too (it wouldn\\'t be worthy of a GRAND TRIBUNAL OF THE AGES or anything, or even losing your powers, but you might expect a couple hail marys).  Where you went wrong is that you skipped the last D.   Demand surrender. \\n After a couple rounds of combat it should have been clear that the party was the superior force and that the Tieflings (who aren\\'t  inherently  evil in Pathfinder) were on the ropes.  Demand surrender, give reasonable terms but be clear that this is  not  a negotiation. \\n >Surrender the stone, take your dead, and leave this land. \\n If they refuse to surrender, you\\'re probably in the clear.  You have offered them the chance to surrender, and have essentially covered your ass. \\n If they do surrender, then they\\'re just as defeated as if you had killed them all. \\n Of course that is not necessarily binary.  Since the 90\\'s gaming has become a lot more grey, more morally questionable than the clear good vs evil themes which were more apparent in the hobby\\'s early years.   But  if they don\\'t immediately accept surrender or refuse it, they\\'ll likely begin a dialogue.  There could be more to the story.  Reset to  Diplomacy  and go from there. \\n Usually, however, I\\'ve found that things will accept surrender.  Hell hath no fury like a Paladin scorned.  If they don\\'t, you might break their ranks anyway, a couple of the less resolved retreat and you\\'re left with an easier fight. \\n There will of course be times when you\\'re not in doubt about the course of action, ignore the 3 D\\'s and dive on in.   Demons, devils, tyrants, necromancers, etc.  There are some enemies that are clearly overwhelmingly evil evil and beyond reasoning, don\\'t bother with them.    They\\'re not a bug, they are a feature of this kind of game which tends to sometimes just let things be Good vs Evil.  Have fun with those. \\n The 3 D\\'s are for the bandits, mercenaries, and \"evil\" that you find at its home with their family.  These are the typical (and popular) scenarios which are practically designed to break Paladins.  You\\'ll know when to use them. \\n The only really questionable action is striking down a combatant that was most likely making an honest retreat.  This mostly depends on your DM, whose description of the action should make it pretty clear that this is a genuine retreat or allow a sense motive roll if they did not make it clear. \\n If in a situation where you\\'re applying the 3 D\\'s and someone is making an honest retreat.  Really running because they are scared for their lives, you should probably let them go. \\n Still shouldn\\'t lose your powers or have any great penalty for that action, but I don\\'t imagine Iomedae would be particularly pleased about it.  Nevertheless, the sweeping generalization of the overall D&D DM mindset is that they  love  to make Paladins fall or otherwise regret being Paladins.  Be proactive about it.  Doubt your actions, meditate about it, humbly ask a church official to discuss the matter and ask for guidance. \\n Last one is especially important because, through that NPC, the DM will give you a clearer idea about what his take on the setting demands.  You\\'ll have a better idea about going forward in future sessions.', 'NO!  Don\\'t.  No.  Don\\'t be that way. \\n The answer to everything in Shadowrun is \"magic!... because magic!\"  It\\'s a huge contributor to the game\\'s imbalances and internal  insanity. \\n Sure, you could go straight by the rules and catch him with magic (... because magic!).  Congratulations, you\\'ve got him right where you\\'ve want him. \\n You know what else you\\'ve got?  A ruined game.  A game where, no matter how slick anyone is or how good they are or how careful they are, they can get caught and screwed over (... because magic!) and there\\'s nothing they can do about it. \\n Listen, if you don\\'t fudge the dice because you don\\'t think its fair then \"because magic\" is  not  a fairer solution to the problem.  Sure magic can do anything it says it can without  any  mundane recourse (... because magic!), but that is one of the games  weaknesses  not one of its strengths. \\n Sure, every single corporation, at every single site,  could  have dozens of spirits just chilling out and constantly maintaining Detect Life and Detect Hostile and Detect What-the-fuck-ever.  The  mechanics  support that (the fluff makes excuses about why that is expensive or whatever, but its not a compelling argument). \\n And it breaks the game.  Allowing that to happen creates a setting in which Shadowruns are not within suspension of disbelief.  Just.  Not.  That doesn\\'t just fuck the infiltrator that fucks everyone, and if Shadowrunners can\\'t shadowrun while playing Shadowrun then what good is Shadowrun?  None.  No good at all. \\n Allowing that to happen, even once, is going to have a very lasting and very negative impression upon the player and the game.  As a mundane character, it becomes clear to him that there is  nothing  he can do about magical spirity detect-whatever bullshit. \\n Just like there\\'s nothing he, as a mundane, can do about providing adequate healing.  Just like there\\'s nothing he, as mundane, can do to adequately combat spirits.  Just like there\\'s nothing he, as a mundane, can do about ritual magic. \\n You should be noticing a pattern here.  It is  not  something that needs further reinforcement in a fucking  cyberpunk  setting that has already lost most of the punch of being a cyberpunk setting over the last couple editions. \\n Just watch him. Pay attention to him.  He sounds like a very methodical player, but I guarantee that there are things that he checks for and things that he does not check for.  You\\'ll find a hole in his routine eventually and exploiting it will very much be fair and very much be something that he  can  look out for in the future and become both a better player and character because of. \\n Rather than \"because magic\" which just screws him for the sake of screwing him, because you can (... because magic!) and he has absolutely no recourse. \\n He wants to be a badass cyber-hacker-spy-ninja.  Sounds like he has done a good job.  Pointing out that the very character concept  isn\\'t  possible, because magic, is absolutely detrimental to the game of Shadowrun as a  whole. \\n If an enemy (a player) seems impenetrable, the easiest way to open them up is to attack their weaknesses.   In this case that is probably his allies.  Maybe put someone  else  at risk and force him to respond quickly, this\\'ll open him up to making mistakes and you can make as hard of a move as you feel necessary. \\n Furthermore, when in doubt, become his fan.  His character\\'s fan.  Maybe just celebrate that he is  fucking good  at his job; as a Shadowrunner  should  be.  You can certainly craft a compelling story out of that all on its own. \\n edit/', 'This was too long and I was sort of all over the place.  I really need to start a blog so I can have this shit written out better and link references.  You asked a complicated question, but I felt like I owed you a complicated answer. \\n Get better at improv.  That doesn\\'t just mean getting better at coming up with D&D crap on the fly, learn about comedy improv and its rules because a large amount of it transfers over just fine. \\n Encounters \\n Running on the fly used to be a common way of doing things because the (equivalent of) CR tables worked.  You could just crack open a Monster Manual and put together adequate encounters pretty quickly.  Admittedly, 3.0 - PF era games kind of threw a large monkey wrench into this due to the gigantic variation in relative party strength between (for example) 12th level parties.  Doing encounters on the fly in this era of gaming can be really fucking hard, but for low level stuff its still a breeze.  In 3.0 - PF, you\\'ve got at least 6 levels where you can slap together compelling, balanced encounters without breaking a sweat.  After that it either takes a lot of system mastery (good) or you just fudge dice if your on the fly encounter was off the mark one way or the other (less good).  In either case, you get better as you go and there are some decent programs that help a bit (though, again, the difference in party strength between two sets of 14th level characters can be all over the place).  With other systems its  damn  easy to do still. \\n Encounters are definitely the hardest part of doing this and its doubly hard in 3.0 - PF.  I learned how to do this stuff in 2nd edition, so admittedly I had a hell of a head start before building encounters became so convoluted.  Still very easy to do in other systems, but 3.0 - PF are a headache. \\n Location/Setting \\n For location, they\\'re pretty easy to do by the seat of your pants.  When you\\'re starting out you\\'d essentially draw up 6 -7 mostly complete dungeons that were essentially the MADLIBS equivalent of underground architecture.  As you got better at improv you could essentially design a compelling environment completely on the fly. \\n Maybe categorize some tables for the five senses, not for random generation, but to have seed reference to build off of to give the players their sensory information.  Really handy to build a compelling adventure setting on the fly (my sense of smell is  terrible  so I completely forget about olfactory stuff if I don\\'t have something to build off of). \\n If your group wants to do Goloian then you\\'re stuck there, but I tend to like to build my own world if my players aren\\'t picky about a certain premade setting (some people have gotten  really  attached).  Hell, I find it better not to design the entirety of the world itself.  Characters don\\'t have google maps.  Most Royalty don\\'t have maps much further than their territories and the surrounding areas.  You can absolutely just design a small chunk of the world for the players to play in and fill the rest of it out as you find out what the players are interested in.  If one of them says they hail from a desert in the east, make a desert in the east and throw some hooks out for them to go there.  You can build an entire world just off of subtle hints from the players if you ask the right questions. \\n Story \\n As far as story goes, your prep work is notes.  You\\'d keep track of who the characters are, who the characters  were , what the characters want, and what segments really got the attention of certain players. \\n Even when players are \"doing their own thing,\" they\\'re not completely random and sessions almost always end with them approaching somewhere or planning to do something.  In that case you can do fully intensive planning for stories/encounters/locations that will show up in the next session.  They\\'re still doing what they want to do, but you\\'ll have time to be as meticulous as you want. \\n Really, they can wander around in your blank slate sandbox world for only the first few sessions, and this stuff is super easy to improv.  During this time you get to know the players/characters and toss out a couple hooks here and there for vague stories.  The players will latch on to a hook they\\'re interested in and will begin to pursue.  At that point you can either keep winging it or (between sessions) go full super in depth railroad mode. \\n Then keep track of how interested or willing the players are.  Maybe they\\'re willing to follow some vast unfolding conspiracy that started with the low-level quest hook/rumor \"disappearances in neighboring town and rumors of strange lights at the graveyard.\"  If they\\'re into it, lead them to a cult, and then necromancers, and then a big nasty lich trying to use Undead to something-something the world.  If they\\'re not, it\\'s just some antsy undead in a graveyard and you drop a few more hooks. \\n Hell, plan on ending it there.  Table chat happens.  Take notes.  If they were interested in the last adventure they\\'ll talk about it around the table.  Stuff like, \"I dunno, couple ghouls hanging out is a bad sign.  I\\'ll bet there is something else going on.\"  Sure it\\'s just table talk, but as far as story progression goes they\\'re essentially telling you they\\'re interested in seeing that storyline go further.  They don\\'t have to know that there  wasn\\'t  \"something else going on,\" but clearly they\\'re signaling that they would like for there to be.  Go for it. \\n Hell, they might reference back to previous areas/adventures.  Throw out some hooks to tie things together. \\n Feel free to ask them questions too.   \"Hey, what does Krognar think about the undead anyway?  He seemed pretty brutal with those ghouls.  Has he had any bad experiences with them?\"  4 out of 5 times they\\'ll give you something really cool about the character\\'s past that you wouldn\\'t have gotten from a pre-written backstory, and if you\\'re decent at reading players they\\'ll almost always give you hints at how much they enjoyed that session (also they\\'ll enjoy the brief spotlight on their character).  Not every DM needs to be some cackling figure lording from behind a cardboard screen who only gets involved to poke at the players with the world, this is a team sport.  Hell, I start every session with a question for everyone about something that I either think is relevant or that I feel the players would enjoy briefly talking about.  Great source of info, backstory, and seeds to build drama on. \\n You can wing entire campaigns, really cool ones, but really the easier thing to do is to wing stuff while learning about the players/characters and tossing out hooks/clues until you get a solid bite.  Then craft something bigger out of whatever hook grabbed them and find a way to continually tie it into the characters story to make it personal.  Explore it until it reaches a natural conclusion.  If you\\'re good at throwing out hooks and getting info out of the players, the campaign usually settles into its stride with a \"definite goal\" that the players have essentially chosen.  At that point they\\'ve sort of built the railroad for you.', 'I like to say that there is a spectrum to being a GM.  Different games (intentionally or not) tend to encourage the game to be towards one end of the spectrum or another. \\n DM Driven Narrative \\n One end is more task and challenge oriented.  Traditional dungeon crawls or perhaps even Shadowruns.  There is an end goal and to get there the players are essentially going through an obstacle course.  These obstacles can be anything:  Disarming a trap, winning a combat, opening a door, solving a puzzle, hacking the security cameras, anything. \\n A barebones dungeon could be easily conceptualized as the characters navigating a series of obstacles to get from point A to point B. \\n The furthest extreme of this end of the spectrum would be a very hardcore, very linear dungeon wherein all parts must be completed before moving on to the next part.  A lot of old dungeon crawl modules fall into this category. \\n Now take a step back, because this isn\\'t just about dungeon design.  If the game\\'s  story  plan is \"OK the players kill the goblins, and then they meet the king, the king sends them off to fight the skeletons where they find the gem.  They take the gem to the wizard, the wizard tells them its necromancy from the south, the players go south and find the lich, they players must search for the lich\\'s phylactery by following clues from the three ancient tombs, the players finally confront the lich with the phylactery and defeat him.  The end.\" \\n That is just an obstacle course made up of obstacle courses all strung together. \\n Shadowrun tends to be a particularly solid example of this rigid story structure and methodology.  The GM prepares a job and  thats  the job.  The players do the job which tends to be a bit more open ended than a typical dungeon (but then it\\'s just a modular dungeon, the players choose not to talk their way in but hack a side door instead for example).  Next week another job is available and  thats  the job. \\n There is nothing inherently wrong with this methodical way of storytelling.  It\\'s how books, television, movies, and most video games work.  It can work in tabletop as well, but you need to find a way to get the players to willingly surrender their agency and go along with it.  Can be accomplished through drama and invoking the right character motivations. \\n This side of the spectrum is the best for Dungeon Master driven narrative.  The kind of narrative where a DM essentially has a book or movie planned out and they want to get players to go about it and act it out. \\n Unfortunately, this side is also  extremely  prone to player derailment.  If the players cannot or will not be convinced to \"go along with it,\" if the DM loses their interest or there is missteps in the game\\'s Drama, then the players are going to go off script and the DM is going to find themselves in uncharted territory. \\n Player Driven Narrative \\n The other side of the spectrum is one that is predominantly based on Player driven narrative.  The DM still does quite a bit of work, but typically does not arrive the first session with any overarching story planned.  None.  Maybe a couple hooks in mind or themes, but there\\'s certainly no extensive dungeons or sprawling epic planned yet. \\n First sessions in this kind of game tend to be loose and improvised.  DMs learn about the characters in one or two ways.  They either ask for a written backstory ahead of time which they collect on the first night and go over with each player, or they simply start the game and ask a load of questions as the game is running. \\n In either case, the DM observes the players and their characters carefully and takes a load of notes (about the game, about their reactions, and about either their backstories or the answers to the questions). \\n First sessions tend to be very simplistic, completely by the seat of the DM\\'s pants or planned out stuff that is generic enough to work on its own.  Typical tavern meets and \"go kill goblins\" kind of stuff.  Good DMs will ask questions of the Players about their characters and take a  shit  ton of notes the whole time. \\n After the session the DM then goes through all the notes (and backstories if collected) and begins to plan some sort of big story that will tie everything together. \\n Sidenote:  Pet peeve of mine.  It became en vogue for DM\\'s to demand these lengthy backstories but not exactly know   why   they\\'ve asked for them.  They still have their methodical DM driven narrative all meticulously plotted out and have no intention of really involving the characters backstories, they just know that good DMs ask for them and expect players to be ROLEplayers not ROLLplayers.  So somewhere along the line it became   TOTALLY NORMAL   for DMs to demand a 4000 word essay before the game even starts as some sort of entrance exam that never amounts to anything.  Fucking drives me crazy.  If you\\'re going to make me thoroughly spell out my characters past, thoughts, hopes, dreams, and goals then it had better be central to whatever you\\'re planning.  It seldom is, but I\\'m way off topic at this point \\n The game\\'s entire story would involve the character\\'s own stories and motivations and essentially let the players \"do what they want when they want.\" \\n The script is flipped.  Rather than the DM providing challenges for the players to improvise and react to, the Players are voicing actions and the DM is the one improvising and reacting. \\n And improvise they do!  They have no choice really.  Its impossible to plan out a long intricate plot like this, but the players are always interested because they\\'re essentially deciding the direction of the story and the DM is just shooting from the hip to accommodate them. \\n Should things slow down the DM has  lots  of shit to hook the players back in by consulting their notes (they have been taking notes right?) Players running out of steam?  The Barbarian mentioned a sister 4 sessions back, and they  did  ignore those cultists a while ago.  BOOM!  Easy.  Barbarian catches word that his sister has disappeared.  The player is  definitely  going to want to go check that out and the other players, without much momentum of their own, will be happy to tag along.  You\\'ve got a whole \\'nother month\\'s worth of adventure just by dragging two notes together and the players will be super happy that you\\'re dragging their character\\'s past to the surface. \\n The strength of this type of playing is that it is impossible for the players to go off script because there really isn\\'t one.  The DM just takes notes for what they\\'re interested in and strings a story together and drags it along to a climax that feels natural.  Rinse and repeat. \\n There are two weaknesses of this system.  First is, obviously, that it is harder.  Its really easy to set up an obstacle course themepark and a lot harder to try and dredge up a compelling narrative on the fly.  Its a lot of work, but DMs learn and get better with time. \\n The  core  weakness is game mechanics.  This style of storytelling really suffered in the era of 3rd edition (and by extension 3.5/PF).  The difficulty of improvising compelling content goes up exponentially with the complexity of the game\\'s mechanics.  There is a \"baseline party strength\" that the monsters are designed around, but you\\'ll  never  run with that party and almost everything requires tweaking in a complex system.  5th should be much more suited to this storytelling style though I don\\'t have a lot of experience with trying yet. \\n The middle \\n Realistically, most games fall somewhere in the middle.  The DM meticulously plans out a bunch of content and a bunch of stories and lets the players run free.  I don\\'t think I need to talk about this one much because if you understand each side of the spectrum than that couple sentences ought to describe the middle. \\n There\\'s obviously a lot that can occur along the spectrum as well, I\\'ll leave that up to your imagination. \\n The strengths of this is that the DM has well prepared content and the players are free to choose from it. \\n The weaknesses are... frankly I think a lot.  I don\\'t particularly like running this way.  It\\'s a shit ton of prep work, just a  lot  of prep work.  Then when you\\'re done with the prep work there\\'s no real guarantee that the players will have actual interest in any of it.  That leaves them pacing around Disneyland while the DM is poking at them to try the rides. \\n anyway \\n My players do not surprise me, because my game is designed  around  them.  I\\'m just making up story threads as I go along, and I\\'m essentially doing it using  their  ideas and the drama they have created for me.  When I\\'ve got enough of them I weave em together into something that makes sense and then let them \"discover it.\"  At that point I usually meticulously design something big and grand (keeping the characters motivations and abilities in mind, let them all shine and hopefully tax them all as well).  Every time they leap on it like rabid beasts and are excited for it because I\\'ve used their own pathos to get them there. \\n This .  Even for the methodical, DM driven narrative types, there is a lot of good DM tips in there. \\n There\\'s an awful lot more to all of this.  I really enjoy the player driven narrative because I\\'m just a cooperative kind of person and I\\'ve always been good with the improv, but that is just the kind of game I like to  run. \\n People might  prefer  games more towards one side of the spectrum or the other, but I wouldn\\'t say one or the other is inherently better, and I\\'ve enjoyed games from both ends of the spectrum.']": "Based on the user's reddit postings, it seems that the user is primarily interested in tabletop gaming, specifically Dungeons and Dragons", "[\"My friend and I are driving across the country and doing whatever  missions/things/tasks/stuff .

It depend of what you means by 100%. It\\'s a tricky definition. \\n Do all parts of you brain are working/activating? Definitely yes. Do all neurons of your brain are firing at their maximum speed? Hell no. you wouldn\\'t be able to live with it (see for example epilepsy). \\n Take any studies done with fMRI. You will see small cluster of activation in some area of the brain for one given task. But it doesn\\'t mean that the rest of your brain is not \"activated\". \\n Basically, to see that kind of things, you take the activity of your brain doing the task and you subtract the activity of your brain not doing the task. But if you observed the BOLD signal of your brain not doing the task, you would see a global activation. Same thing with an EEG signal : you have continuous activation. A continuous blood flow. A continuous consumption. It\\'s not necessarily constant, it can have slight variation. And when you do specific task a neuron or group of neuron can either be inhibited, or activated. \\n But even when resting, your brain has an activity. \\n When you use a specific function that is related to specific part(s) of the brain, some neurons will activate \"more\" (generally, it will increase the frequency of their firing rate, but it can also decrease the frequency of their firing rate). But contrary to popular belief, more is not necessarily good. If you could increase the firing of any neurons with deep brain stimulation, I would advise against it (except if it is a medical reason). If I decide to electrically stimulate your hippocampus, you wouldn\\'t gain extraordinary memory. I could even suggest it would do the opposite (see for example depressive patient treated with electroconvulsive therapy). \\n The only possible exception I can think of is if you do not perform a particular task during one day. It would be difficult to do without thinking, planning, feeling emotion, seeing something... But it could be done with motor activation. If I amputate some part of your body (let\\'s say your left arm), the area responsible for motor representation of this limb could not be specifically activated (theoretically. Because it has been suggested that an incorrect activation of sensori-motor representation of missing limb could be associated with the phantom limb perception). \\n Because the brain do not like \"unused\" space (and like I said before, no specific activation doesn\\'t necessarily mean no activation, there could be a baseline), it would be replaced after some time (for example, if I cut one of your finger, the next fingers would take over this area).', 'Okay ! \\n So, one possible theory about  biological attraction  is based on the fact that there is benefits to have a system that easily consider potential mates. During human evolution, a strong child was a child that could resist disease, and to do so, you would need the help of your  immune system . \\n Now, to continue, I have to describe how works a part of your immune system. When a pathogen enter your body, your body reacts and try to destroy it. To do so, there is many ways, but one in particular interests us today : the White Blood Cells (WBC) will \"eat\" it. \\n Some WBC are slow and dumb, but they do an awesome job because they are big and powerful. They want to destroy, but don\\'t really know who to hit. So, how does the WBC recognizes which are pathogens and which are self-cells? \\n The T-cells will help. They are small, intelligent and highly specialized. Each of them have learned to recognize one enemy in particular. And when they find it, they will send a big firework to say \"there is an enemy here\". It\\'s extremely important they don\\'t believe one self-cell is a stranger, because once they signal it, it will be destroyed (remember, WBC are stupid).  Think of the implication in auto immune disease, or organ transplantation. \\n So, to assure that T cell will not make any mistake, all  self-cell  have molecule on their surface that are called  \"Major histocompatibility complex\"  (MHC, or in human : HLA) which is recognized by T cell. Similar to a uniform that would be 1) absolutely unique to your cells, and 2) determined by your genes. \\n (You bet than the real immune response is incredibly more complicated than that, and I have oversimplified some point... But you got the main idea). \\n Heterozygosity  is good for your survival. Different MHC alleles would increase your genetic variability and give you a better chance to have a \"stronger\" immune system  (not exactly right, more like a world where everyone would be identical could be wiped out by only one pathogen) . \\n So, many studies have proposed and showed a biological system that could determine a part of our attraction for the opposite sex. For example, when sniffing worn T-shirt of male, women rated higher (in attractiveness) the  odor  of males that had the most different MHC (remember, heterozygosity is good). \\n We don\\'t know if odor are the only way to signal the MHC (some papers have theorized saliva and other exchange of body fluids). But another interesting finding is the difference in attraction during cycle. \\n The most different MHC are perceived particularly attractive during  ovulation . But it seems that we observe the opposite effect during a  pregnancy  and/or during  menstruation . In other words, we are searching for closer MHC during that time. One explanation could be that once pregnant, you are in need of a familial structure, and your sibling/mother/father have closer MHC.  (the fact that it shift during pregnancy could have offered a good selective value, particularly when having a child was synonym of danger -like first homo sapiens-) \\n Another interesting fact is the effect of the pills or any  hormonal birth control . It\\'s mimicking the effect of pregnancy, thus making you attracted to similar MHC. It could explain the different attraction that women can have toward their SO when they stop taking the pills (especially if they choose it when under the influence of BC). Like \"feeling he is not the same\", \"more irritated by his behavior\", \"looking for a different type of men\", \"lower libido\", \"he have a stronger smell\",... \\n Body function can influence our behavior and attraction, and it is why it is fundamental to know it. To make the right (\"rational\") choice. \\n The good thing? It has actually been proven that BC is helping you for the longevity of your relationship. MHC is not the only thing that is affected by BC, your attraction to \"male characteristic\" is. In other words, when ovulating, women become more aroused with \"alpha\" features (deep voice, strong face, muscles,...). When pregnant, they are more attracted with \"beta\" features, because it is an indication of good parental ability & care. \\n The BC limits this mechanism, and you will be less attracted to \"alpha\" male. In other words, you naturally choose \"a good partner\" and your relationship is more likely to be long and strong. they were less reported cheating, more satisfaction, increased duration and overall greater satisfaction when women used BC at their first date. \\n NB : I\\'m not saying anything absolute. We are humans, we have a brain that can be influenced, be we can also think to try to make the best decision. Increased chance in statistic doesn\\'t mean suddenly a huge change, it can be a rather subtle one.', 'First thing : as everyone else have said, this therapist shouldn\\'t do what he does. Confidentiality is essential between patient and therapist. And like BrighTide has said, even in the \"best case scenario\", the situation doesn\\'t look very good. \\n You may not want to report him, and it\\'s your choice. But the first thing you should do is talk to your wife. 1) she has to know what he has said and 2) You know your wife better than me, but I\\'m pretty sure the \"it\\'s been 3 years, little progress, lets try someone different\" won\\'t work. I mean, she has all the reasons to believe her therapist, he is in a dominant position (he could have suggested that she was making progress, that she was realizing that you weren\\'t the best husband, that she needed him, etc. whatever he want). But again, I do not know him or your wife, it\\'s all suppositions. \\n The second thing is : even if she said that, and if it\\'s true, I don\\'t think it means what you believe. What I understand from what you write is that you think \"doesn\\'t love you\" = \"dislike you\" (or at least \"is indifferent and just follow passively the events\"). From what you are saying, I think I understand the feeling of your wife, because this is how I feel. \\n > is her determination to stay with me her version of love? \\n And if it was me, I\\'d said yes, it is. Because she is with you and doesn\\'t want to go elsewhere. It\\'s likely she is where she want to be. But you can\\'t be certain unless you speak with her. \\n It\\'s just an hypothesis, but maybe you would be depressed too if you had the impression of being not \"wired\" for love, in a situation where you would have absolutely all things to make you happy but where you couldn\\'t feel that seemed right. Where you can\\'t really find where you belong. And the worst thing is you can\\'t really tell your husband because he is quite emotional about you, and can\\'t really understand because he seems \"normal\", like all people surrounding you. You fear that if he could misunderstood what you have to say, and want to leave you. You feel different, broken in the eyes of the media, society, movie, books, and what the others couple say. And you don\\'t know how to fix it. So you see a therapist, but it doesn\\'t change anything, because he has is point of view. So, nothing works, and you become more and more depressed, obsessed by the fact that you are depressed and you shouldn\\'t be. (I\\'m not talking about personal feeling here, it\\'s really a total guess) \\n Calmly, gently approach her, and talk to her, in a understanding and non aggressive way. Try to find all the reason of her depression (and do not forget that depression is a disease), how she feels about you, about the children, about her life, etc. It will take some time (I\\'m talking about year-ish time here), but I really believe the moment she will be strong enough to face the truth about her feelings, and share them with you, it will be a huge improvement in your relationship, and maybe she won\\'t need a therapist anymore. \\n Maybe a little \"advice\" here (disguised in question) : in your point of view, how do you determine what is love? Who and what can forge (and have forged) your feelings and your perception on feelings? And from what you know of her, what are her answers? \\n In my humble opinion, the only solution for her is to accept herself, her limits, and become strong enough to be absolutely certain to make her own choice because she want it. The only question is : \"how do I want to live my life?\" And from my point of view, the answer include you (supposition, again).', 'IIRC : Man (OP) ask his wife about swinging, question remain unanswered (neither yes or no, slightly more no).

Try to say it to his wife, but she isn\\'t listening, and seems to clearly enjoy the experience. Man is sad, leave the room. The next morning, OP and wife discuss, it doesn\\'t go well.

Usually when he first got up from a nap he\\'d have a little limp in the back. It was enough for me to notice but he always walked out of it and it never seemed to bother him or keep him from running and playing so stupidly, we did not go to the vet for it. Big dog, hard floors. No problem, right? \\n And then he was playing in the yard one night, yelped, and was completely non-weight bearing on the left hind. Rushed to the emergency vet, they checked him out and were able to tell immediately when they felt they moved the knee that it was a torn ACL. They can\\'t tell if it\\'s just partial or full tear that easily. They said give it a couple weeks and if no improvement we will talk surgery. \\n Two weeks later, no improvement, he had the first TPLO done. CCL was fully torn, and his meniscus was also partially torn. Would not have healed without surgery. \\n Two weeks after the first TPLO, he was given the all-clear for short 10-15 minute walks. On his very first walk around the yard the next day, he got excited, bounced, and went non-weight bearing in the right leg. Called his surgeon who was kind enough to see him in between surgeries. He confirmed that the second ACL was blown. Give him a couple weeks to see. So we did. \\n Three weeks later he had TPLO #2. CCL was fully torn. Would not have healed without surgery. \\n My guy made a 100% recovery and now runs and plays just as well as he did before he was injured. \\n There are three different surgeries that I know of for this, but I only know about two. There is the Lateral Suture, otherwise known as the \"fishing line\" surgery. It\\'s the least expensive option but also the least solid option. Greater risk of failure, greater risk of arthritis in a young dog, but it\\'ll do the job. \\n The one my dog had, the TPLO, involves actually reshaping the bone and essentially replacing the ACL. It\\'s a very solid, permanent fix with very low risk of failure. There is still a chance for arthritis in a young dog with it (that is unavoidable - doesn\\'t matter which surgery you get) but it\\'s not as high as the lateral suture. The big downside is that it\\'s much more expensive than the lateral suture. Exact cost depends on your area but for the two surgeries  alone , without the emergency vet visit or extra x-rays or other appointments, the total was  OVER $9000!!!  But literally, it was. \\n You\\'re going to need to think about this and start looking up surgical options. If your dog\\'s ACL is fully torn or if it does fully tear at any point, not getting surgery is not a viable option if you ever want your dog to enjoy playing again.', \"God. Yes. I used to be on the fence but now I'm definitely pro-Barkbox. \\n To quote myself from my last response to a Barkbox thread: \\n >I got the first box in August.. 50lb+ of course. Came with a bag of [these]( a bag of [these]( [this]( food topper, [this]( cool mix, and an orange waterproof shark similar to [this]( \\n >Cy LOVED both bags of treats. With a passion. He LOVES the bully flakes (I've been using them sparingly so he doesn't get dependent on them) in his food. I haven't made the cubes or the broth yet but I will, soon. Cy doesn't play with toys so any toy they include is bound to be a dud, so I couldn't be disappointed in it. I really loved the quality of the treats - the liver treats especially, the only ingredient, I believe, was freeze dried turkey liver. I don't remember the duck treats but there was nothing offensive in them either. Cy adored 'em both. \\n >I didn't really know that it would be worth doing more than 1 month at a time, and I wasn't going to pay $30 a month for month to month. I canceled my sub. They promptly suckered me back in with a buy-three-get-greatest-hits deal so now I've got more coming. \\n >This month we got a green turtle toy for hardcore chewers (Cy is not - toy is again a waste), spray on wound bandage, a box of really interesting treats with the flavor of 'Tuscan Pizza' and yes they smell good enough to eat, a bag of beef jerky biscuits, and a crunchy deer chew that was gone in about 0.2 seconds flat. Obviously well loved by Cy. The other two treats, again a big hit but Cy isn't picky. The wound spray might come in handy someday and I wouldn't have ever thought to buy it myself. The toy, again, meh. \\n >I just today got the greatest hits box they offered me when they suckered me back into signing up. They sent two chews, one beef and cheddar and one chicken and cheddar, slim-jim like in texture and the first one I gave him was gone instantly as well.. They sent a firm velvety-ish squeaky toy, hard to describe, but again Cy didn't even look at it so w/e, a bag of treats flavored like coconut, molasses, and flax - they're training treat size and low calorie which is a really nice change from all the big treats. They sent a bag of beef treats which I haven't opened yet, and a bottle of dog beer. Yeah. [DOG BEER.]( I can't wait to see what the boy thinks of that. \\n >Cy now basically thinks that any box that comes through the door is his, after three barkboxes and one pawbox (do not recommend pawbox, btw - seriously) he gets excited when I get a box from the mailman. Automatically thinks it's for him. Usually it is, lol. \\n >I have really liked the treats they've sent so far. They're all really nice quality treats that have gone over with the dogboy very well. They give you a tracking number when they send the boxes out on the 15th of the month which is extra nice. The toys are a waste for us since Cy doesn't have ANY interest in toys, but.. what can ya do. The wound spray was nice and the mix in the first box was something I'd never seen before. I may actually continue to get the boxes after the third month here. \\n >If you want to try it, you can get  $10 off \\n I recently sent an email to Barkbox support asking if they'd consider sending a treat ball or puzzle toy of some kind since my dog doesn't really play with toys. I thought that would be the only kind of toy he'd play with. I got a prompt response asking me more about his likes and dislikes. Conclusion: a box arrived today, in  addition  to the regularly-scheduled October Barkbox, containing an  IQ ball . At no charge. Just because I politely asked if they'd consider sending something, they went ahead and sent Cy one and sent him a surprise, too. \\n The October box arrived today. In it was a chew like the one above but  rabbit  flavored, a glow in the dark ball, a strange chew/tug/whatever toy, a bag of goat liver treats, and a bag of 8 mini treat bags. Like, Halloween gift bags. \\n There is a blog that reviews the barkboxes.. The lady that writes the blog reviews lots of subscription boxes. She gets one small box a month for her two small dogs to share and she actually adds up the monetary value of everything in the box to compare to the price. Most of the months I looked through were worth about $35-40 at retail value for the SMALL dog box. So you definitely get your money's worth.

I WANT A DIRE WOLF!\"  who will eventually go out and buy some wolf hybrid or super scammy designer breed on appearances alone.. \\n Wolfdogs are not pets. They are  NOT  pets. I\\'m sorry. If you get a wolf hybrid on appearances without reading up on them (which will surely deter you from getting one), you are a  fucking moron . \\n Wolfdogs are NOT animals with a dog\\'s personality in a wolf\\'s body. They do NOT behave like dogs. You will not have a pet who can be trusted around your neighbor\\'s cats, or who can be let off-leash in the open without fear of running away. You will not have a pet who can be easily trained and who will do what you want, when you want. You will have a pet who is very likely to be very stand-offish and wary of strangers, skittish, difficult to train with an incredibly high prey drive and instinct to run away. When they bite, they bite HARD. Wolf hybrids are part wild animal and they fucking act like it, whether you want to believe it or not. They are not good house pets AT ALL. \\n There is a reason there are so many sanctuaries for wolves and wolf hybrids. People get them and then find out the hard way that they are NOT. FUCKING. DOGS. Very few people can actually handle a hybrid, especially that is medium or high wolf content so encouraging people to keep breeding them by buying them is completely irresponsible and idiotic. Owning a wolfdog doesn\\'t make you look cool, it makes you look like an ignorant twat who got a dog  solely  because of its looks because a wolfdog cannot provide a  single fucking thing  that any breed of domestic dog cannot. \\n Also, buying a puppy (wolf hybrid or not) at six weeks makes you look like an exceptionally irresponsible, ignorant potential dog owner. Buying a  wolfdog  at six weeks... I cannot even properly put into words how much of an idiot that makes you seem like.', 'The beauty comes at a huge price. \\n They\\'re highly intelligent, but not obedient. They have absolutely no desire to please their humans at all - they do what they want, when they want, and if you stop them or tell them to knock it off they will usually yell at you. They\\'re very stubborn and challenging to train not because they\\'re unintelligent but because they just don\\'t give a shit. They are fully capable of figuring out problems. They can and will figure out how to open cabinets, the fridge, simple locks, how to work the ice machine on the fridge, how to open that container you left on the counter containing leftovers set out to cool, etc. They\\'re VERY clever. They are absolutely the kind of dog who will create a diversion in one room to draw you out of the room with food in it so they can steal it. Smartasses. \\n They like to run away. They will jump over, climb over, dig under, or chew through fencing if they want to get out. If your gate\\'s latch is fairly simple, they may learn how to work it. If you let them off the leash, the vast majority will just fuck off into the woods and never come back no matter how loudly you scream \"FLUFFY! COME!\" \\n They are, however, super friendly. To everyone. All the time. Crazy ski-mask wearing bad guy breaks into your house with a machete? Dog\\'s either all over that shit or running out the door behind him. They have no natural protective instinct which means they absolutely will not protect your family or your property from anything except maybe squirrels. They do like killing small animals. \\n Also energy. A LOT of it. \\n They aren\\'t beginner dogs.', \"There's no way we could possibly know.. First, that puppy is too young to tell, secondly it isn't YOUR dog so it does not have the exact same features, and third.. your dog already has three breeds in it.. unless its sire was a really distinct looking purebred (and I doubt anybody breeding a corgi/pug/beagle mix would be very selective about choosing a mate for her) that passed on a LOT of his appearance, chances are, we wouldn't be able to tell anyway.\", \"Is there a way to prevent this knee from fully blowing out, or the other from partially tearing as I know he has an increased risk once one goes. \\n Sure there is - never let him have fun. \\n But seriously, the only way to prevent it from getting worse (if it IS only a partial tear) is to pretty much baby him. No running, jumping, or fast-paced play. Gentle walks, swimming. That's really about it. As for preventing the other one, yeah, not really. \\n >Is the weakness genetic or is it just bad luck? He definitely did not come from a good breeding background, and is a JRT mix with slightly bowed legs. \\n My dog is a blue-blooded Siberian Husky with good, clean legs. When he was conceived, somebody was hoping for a new show dog. He blew out both of his completely within 6 weeks of each other at 3 years of age. It has nothing to do with your dog's breeding. \\n A lot of it is just bad luck. Just bad, bad luck. It's thought that neutering young can contribute to a higher risk of torn ACLs, and overweight dogs are certainly at greater risk if they start tearing around like an idiot, but a lot of it is just bad luck. Once one goes, the other one is likely to follow. \\n I can't tell you what to do but I can tell you what I did. \\n Cy was just over 3 years old and probably weighed about 80lbs at the time. He was neutered young (6mos) and was overweight (his sire was 75lbs at the same age and a little shorter - so not  terrible  if you want to compare that way..). I had noticed that he would sometimes get up from napping and be a little 'off' in the rear. I couldn't tell which leg the lameness was in and there was no heat or swelling or pain reactions throughout the leg, and as he walked out of it in a minute I didn't think too much of it. My old boss's mastiff limped after a nap too. Sleeping on the hardwood floor did that to her. I assumed the same thing. \\n One night he goes out to play, sprints full-speed down the side of the house toward the back door and as he's going, he suddenly yelps, stops, and sits his ass down. My father calls me from outside, I go out and confirm he's completely non-weight bearing in the left hind, and we immediately put him in the car and take him to the emergency vet. Diagnosis: torn ACL. Prescription: two weeks' hard rest, painkillers, anti-inflammatory pill and then reexamine. If no improvement, we talk surgery. They can't really tell the exact extent of the tear and no improvement would suggest a full one. \\n Two weeks later, no improvement, we schedule a TPLO. Surgery happens. Surgeon says, yes, the CCL was completely blown and he had a minor meniscal tear as well. Surgery was the only way he would've healed. No big deal. More rest, painkillers, anti-inflammatories. Two weeks later he's cleared for gentle walks. The very next day my father takes him in the yard, he gets excited, bounces, goes dead lame right hind. His surgeon manages to see him in between surgeries that day and confirms yes, the other ACL tore. Two more weeks hard rest, painkillers, anti-inflammatories. Recheck, no improvement, schedule surgery. TPLO #2. Surgeon confirms afterwards that the thing was fully blown, and again, would not have healed without surgery. \\n Two and a half months after the second surgery he was allowed off the leash in the yard again and allowed to work up to normal activity again. We're now almost two years on from the first tear and he's 100% sound.. you'd never know. His food has glucosamine/condroitin in it and I give him an extra pill just in case; the surgery we went with is extremely effective and has a lower late of early arthritis but you can never be too safe, especially as he has issues with his weight. \\n If your dog's tear actually is bad, it will need surgery. They don't really heal. Humans get torn ACLs - how many athletes do you know of that've torn their ACL and not had surgery for it?\", 'I went to a dog park a few weeks ago for a husky/malamute meetup. There were separate sections for large dogs and small dogs, as is normal. We had 15 huskies, 2 malamutes, and a small handful of other breeds in the large dog side of the park. There were maybe one or two little dogs on the other side. \\n This older guy comes with three little dogs. A dachshund, a pomeranian, and some little terrier mix or something. All of them have their little coats on and all that. This guy takes his three little dogs  into the large dog section of the park . Which was  full  of dogs. \\n Needless to say, the little dogs came in and the huskies were all interested. The owners were constantly pulling their dogs away from the pomeranian. The owner of the little dogs was not paying one bit of attention. He was politely asked to go to the other side, and he did not. One of the huskies eventually decided the pom was prey and closed his mouth around the back of the pom\\'s neck. Thankfully the owner was standing right there and chased his dog off, the dog let go straight away, no injuries were caused, but at that point the owner of the three little dogs was  told  to get out of the big dog side. He did, though he was clearly pissed about it. You\\'d think he\\'d be mad about his dog getting chewed on - nope, he was just mad about being forcefully told to go to the side where he should\\'ve been in the first place. \\n Not long after, a lady with a little designer toy dog came into the big dog side (jesus christ why) and MY dog decided he wanted to play with the little thing. The little thing might\\'ve weighed 8-10lbs. Cy weighs 90. I was not at all worried about him eating the little dog but he could\\'ve easily crushed it. I promptly grabbed him and sent him off to play with somebody else and the little dog\\'s owners were all, \"no it\\'s okay, we have big dogs at home, she\\'s very robust.\" Yeah, well I don\\'t want to be responsible for my dog accidentally crushing yours because you can\\'t go to the correct side of the dog park. \\n Idiots.']": "Based on the user's reddit posting history, it can be inferred that the user is interested", "['The best fit I can find...

It depends on the venue. \\n I think we\\'re all so accustomed to the internet platforms you  have  to be on as a writer today, that we forget where critics came from. \\n We ask for critiques when what we really want is encouragement and an editor. \\n And an editor  is  a type of critic - but not the kind everyone thinks of. \\n I remember every \"movie review\" or \"book review\" in the paper growing up, and it was \"This was the worst piece of trash I ever read\" and \"6 thumbs wayyyyy down\" and \"don\\'t waste your time with this movie.\" \\n Some were good, of course, but the columns you could really trust? They didn\\'t pull punches, and they didn\\'t always stick to technical stuff with the work. \\n A critic isn\\'t your cheerleader. A critic should be honest. If they hate your vision, they hate it. They shouldn\\'t have to lie. \\n But they shouldn\\'t tell you you\\'re a dipshit who should never write again, either. \\n If you go to a venue that\\'s open and encouraging and someone trounces you and your story - that\\'s painful. And wrong. There\\'s a way critiques are handled on, say /r/keepwriting, or the weekly critique thread here, that is very different from, say /r/destructivereaders. \\n I post honest feedback on both, but I\\'m way more intense (assholish) on RDR. It\\'s not the critic\\'s - or the sub/venue\\'s responsibility to assuage your ego, or decide what you can handle as a writer. It\\'s yours. \\n If you know that one random asshole can break you - don\\'t go where assholes critique. \\n There are people who  need  those assholes. I\\'m one of them.

I\\'ve seen people break down in tears over a notation that a comma placement is wrong. Some people are thin skinned no matter if it\\'s focused on the work or not. \\n Some people (me) are thick skinned, and can take whatever you throw at them. \\n And whether a critic  should  be harsh or not doesn\\'t really matter.

And which you choose is entirely up to you. But you will encounter an asshole at some point. \\n I think rather than focusing on the critic (good or bad) it\\'s more important for the writers of the world to learn  how  to handle those critiques. \\n How to know if the critic  gets  your vision. \\n How to find the nuggets of truth in what the assholes say. \\n How to elicit honesty from your cheerleaders. \\n Whether your ideas click with your editor\\'s. \\n When and why it\\'s okay to make an exception to a rule, and what is a rule vs something subjective. \\n >A good critic is an unabashed cheerleader of your artistic vision, even at the expense of your personal pride. \\n No. \\n A good critic is honest about your artistic vision, even at the expense of your personal pride. \\n Preferably without insulting you as a person.', \"IANAL, but I expect it would depend on a lot of things.

His mother works 8 am to 3 pm at another well-paid office job. \\n Bill comes home to a clean home, a parent waiting to help him study, and a full meal in his belly. He goes to bed at a reasonable time, and wakes up to a good breakfast, and both parents home to make sure he gets all his things together for school. \\n Ted\\'s parents are divorced. His dad remarried and has no interest in him, and has fallen behind on child support. Ted\\'s mom has to work 2 jobs to pay the rent.  Ted comes home, if he\\'s lucky, to a babysitter who tosses some pizza rolls in the microwave and sends him off to his room. \\n She tells him to go to bed, but he\\'s six, and she\\'s not paying attention, so he\\'s usually up until his mom gets home around midnight. \\n In the morning, she has to drop him at school too early, on the way to work, so mornings are rushed. If he\\'s lucky, he gets a poptart and remembers his backpack. If not... well he ends up with a lot of zeros on take home assignments.  The school serves breakfast, which he may or may not make it to school in time for, since his mom is on the city bus. \\n When he does get breakfast, it\\'s usually sugary cereal because public school breakfasts offer that option, are largely unsupervised and well, he\\'s  six . \\n Because Bill gets plenty of sleep, eats well, and has parents helping him learn at home, he\\'s able to be alert and attentive in class, does well on his schoolwork, and learns what he needs to do well  next year . \\n Even though Ted is  just as smart , he is sleep deprived, malnourished, and has no outside help. He falls asleep in class, or his mind wanders to lunch, and he doesn\\'t learn everything he needs to do well next year. \\n Either he\\'s held back, in which case he\\'s now a year behind Bill, or he\\'s allowed to move on to second grade, where he cannot do the work because he\\'s unprepared. \\n Most often, conditions won\\'t improve for Ted, but  even if they do  he\\'s still starting behind Bill. \\n They do not have  equal  opportunity, because Bill has advantages Ted does not have. \\n So people start a program. Anyone who doesn\\'t have parents to help them at home can come in for free tutoring, breakfast, dinner, life skills (like getting enough sleep!) ... Each of these classes/programs is geared to getting TEDS on even starting ground with BILLS. \\n If Bill takes these courses too, he\\'s STILL ahead of Ted. \\n Usually, Bill won\\'t, because they say they are for Ted. Most of them would allow Bill anyway. \\n So we replace Bill with the average working class white man, back in the 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s, even the 90s, when these programs started being created. His two parent home is his skin color, which, while providing no specific advantages, also doesn\\'t  hinder  him. \\n At those same times in history, Ted, the average working class black man, had a parental situation (the color of his skin) which did hinder him. Not  everyone  would turn him down for a job because of his skin color, but  some  people would - whereas no one would turn Bill down for his skin color. That\\'s not equal. Same thing went for schools. \\n Even beyond that, a larger percentage of black people (due to racism in the past) started out with less than ideal home/financial backgrounds. \\n So programs were created to get the Teds of the world into an equal starting position. \\n It\\'s supposed to be a temporary measure, where, eventually, there are no \"minorities\" and everyone starts with equal opportunities. \\n That wasn\\'t thought through very well, because even if Bill and Ted start out equal, one may make better choices than the other, and their  children  don\\'t start out equal. Or they both make bad choices, or good choices, and their children start off on lower or higher ground than Jim\\'s kids. \\n Added to this (because we aren\\'t really talking about children) is the fact that there IS still racism in the world, (although much less of it) and the fact that during the process of integration, much of Ted\\'s  culture  was lost. \\n Culture being important to emotional growth (which affects every part of our lives) more groups are formed to celebrate what culture remains. \\n Being a controlling majority of the population means that Bill hasn\\'t suffered as much of this loss. He generally doesn\\'t need the hand up to get onto even ground. \\n That being said MOST of those organizations will still take Bill - the Caucasian applicant. They simply do not usually get the applicants. \\n There\\'s a lot more to it, but this is getting long, so I\\'ll stop for now.']": "Based on the reddit postings, the user seems to be interested in literature, writing, parenting, critiques, and social issues such as equality and racism.", "[\"I'm buying a gift for someone who has a young cat (under 6 months) who loves to play, especially with paper for the reddit pet exchange.

(I mainly read YGO) \\n Granted, I do recall the Zabuza/Haku arc, & IIRC Sasuke I pronounced like Suzuki or some...;( \\n Anyhow, when it came out on TV, I started paying attention to it 0_0...the first chapter I read was in the February \\'06 issue, while keeping up with the anime through various sources of both respectable & questionable quality. I\\'d say the comics I spent more time on, just because I owned them, but the English cast & dub for Naruto is beast - grown up, I can\\'t  believe  the talent in it. \\n IMO the English version in this case is basically Final Fantasy lite, it is  that  legitimate . Aside from having mostly non-struggling actors, it had multiple rounds of wide auditions, & most of the cast aside for an actor or two remains the same.  Viz is also owned directly by the Japanese company, & has very strong influences by them in maintaining consistency. \\n I also like that Viz has done a considerably amazing job of keeping the comics localizations updated, to the point where I managed to stop keeping up with the anime when it got to the filler (I suspect they synchronized it so on purpose) \\n \\n Unfortunately, with the fandom & market being what it is, especially with the shift to cheaper subtitling-streaming, the funding for the dubs have dropped massively.. \\n \\n ..& unlike new dubs, where they may just use Bang Zoom students & staff..these actors are established & busy, so they can only slow down the dubs, versus recasting (ew).. \\n Anyhow,', 'Please keep in mind I am on mobile, & this looks a lot prettier that way \\n So, I\\'m not a  huge  fan of this series (only seen the 26-episode series), but I\\'m a big advocate of dubs & anime being treated better (by TV networks & Hollywood in general)...& it came to my knowledge that, prior to NGE being outsourced as it was, there were plans for Sony to receive the show. Sony\\'s plans included a heavy localization process to create a show they felt would be more enjoyable for their audience. It included a soundtrack with grunge & electronic rock music, focus more on the action scenes & removal of the more \"artful\" parts, & a few other things which I don\\'t recall. \\n \\n The closest analogy I can think of would be somewhat akin to Voltron, or something like FUNimation\\'s adaptation of DBZ (although they\\'d likely have a budget far better than FUNi\\'s college-theater-project) \\n \\n Now, anime (& Japanese entertainment in general, actually) is an industry much smaller (& self-absorbed) than Hollywood (tho everything is), & as cool as  I  & a sizable niche of fans think their stuff may be...it is kinda true that it doesn\\'t have the sort of mass mainstream appeal that, say, Game of Thrones or Breaking Bad does. Even Disney FWR seems to garner much more mainstream respect for I-have-no- ** ing*clue-why. \\n All this being taken into account, I can see why a company operating in a larger market such as Hollywood (keep in mind art is made on piles of  business ) would tell a different sort of story to that audience, & it is rather understandable that a company would have their product sold differently in different markets - after all, almost all localization is, to some extent, an alteration of the original product. \\n \\n Nintendo did this with Fire Emblem Fates, Final Fantasy IV, & various other products on their systems back in the day. Metal Gear Solid dubs, strangely, while not censored at all, left out most of Kojima\\'s original castings, as the dubs were entirely outsourced the way the Polish, Russian, German, etc., dubs were. Thus the characters sound entirely different, & the director even mentioned they  are  different characters (as a non-player, I chiefly see Raiden as the glaringly obvious example) \\n \\n The actual Dragon Ball is generally considered inferior to FUNimation\\'s aforementioned college theater project, just because of the tone, by much of r/anime (who are mostly EU/NA fans) \\n \\n While Pokemon\\'s isn\\'t so bad, who actually knows who Booster, Showers, & Thunder are? \\n \\n \\n \\n Finally, it isn\\'t as if Sony releasing a different show for massive release would  stop  the actual show from existing or  stop  hardcore fans from simply watching fansubs  (after all, it isn\\'t like anyone even  cares  about proper dubs amirite?)...which they still do anyway. \\n \\n I mean it isn\\'t like anime fans are the most...contributive to the industry at all, so it\\'s not like their complaints matter anyway, right? \\n \\n On the contrary, I would argue that, if contracted with much of the original company involvement, it would  vastly  improve the potential quality of shows, boosting the Japanese business tremendously. I mean  look  at the wasted potential the DBZ dub had. I would actually say it\\'s a damn shame the Japanese are so inward-focused.  Heck, if the Americanized version sold well enough, it\\'s not like it\\'d be hard to get those actors to re-record those same lines for an \"uncut\" release, right? \\n \\n & keep in mind Sony is a  Japanese  company - one that does  insanely  well here - they\\'d know what they\\'re doing.', 'Like many, I am one who grew up on Ocean Group\\'s dub (commissioned by IIRC Nelvana?), directed by Terry Klassen or Karl Willems I forget. \\n As opposed to the \\'Murican series from the \\'90\\'s. \\n Sonic is really similar actually (less so Transformers), though that was 4Kids for the anime. \\n Strangely, despite Vancouver actors also dubbing anime (unlike most LA actors), & that US Megaman (& Sonic) shows were done in the same area with the same people (as opposed to SonicX & Transformers RID, which were cheaped out on &done non-union)... \\n ...most of the cast from the US cartoon were rearranged. \\n ...This is even stranger when the SAME talent pool did both Transformers Beast Wars  and  the Unicron anime trilogy. \\n [David Kaye - Megatron in both Beast Wars & Unicron anime (& later Optimus in a US show) - was Protoman in the Megaman anime. \\n Scott McNeil (4 Transformers) was Dr. Wily in the US show, & GutsMan among others in Battle Network] \\n This is...a bit odd. \\n However, it gets stranger when in 2004, Kris Zimmerman (who directed many great English dubs of Japanese games, most famously MGS) got the approval to dub an Onimusha game featuring Rockman.EXE & Lan Hikari...& cast Gwendoline Yeo, a guest live-actress & token Asian character VA, dubbing Megaman, & Colleen O\\'Shaughnessy (Sora from Digimon, & the current Tails from Sonic for Lan Hikari. \\n Clearly a mistake, no? \\n Looking up BTVA, it seems that originally, Lan (rather appropriately) & Megaman were played by women.

Just like puppies or flowers. In fact that was likely entirely the subconscious attraction.\\nAs I grew older, circa 2003-5, for some reason, some of the \"cute\" girls remained (still got the 2 im thinking of on Facebook), but for some reason or another, they were now a \"hot commodity\" so to speak.

Take Asuka for example. She is really outbursting and emotional, but you only learn about her a while into the show. Showing expression helps us understand a character.

I heard someone waiting behind me say \"Hey, I think there\\'s a spot right there (next to me)\" so I turn around and a woman is ushering a young boy over to me. She looks at me, shrugs, and says \"We don\\'t know where his parents are.\" So this 6 year old kid had been waiting in line with them for 45 minutes to ride the coaster alone. I was like \"whatever\" and chatted the kid up while we waited. He was completely nonchalant about having no parents and being about to ride a crazy roller coaster alone. After screaming my head off on the coaster for 2 minutes while the kid sat nonplussed, we got off and I said \"So how are we gonna find your parents?\" We walked down the exit and a man and another child were standing there and said to the kid \"Hey man, how\\'s it going?\" And that\\'s where we parted ways.

Not everyone enjoys dogs that follow you around everywhere but I do; I talk to them and generally enjoy their company, and they give me something to do when I am bored or alone since one of my main hobbies is training them. The main con for me is the time sacrifice. Many times I give up the opportunity to go places for long periods of time if I can't find someone willing to watch them, which is something I don't really mind doing to have them. If Oscar is old enough to be pretty much self sufficient (i.e. not in a crate while home alone for a few hours without destroying the house) like my older dog (if needed, she can be alone in the house for up to 8 hours without a potty break or me worrying she'll get into anything) this may not be too big of an issue. I also have a big fenced yard where they can play so I don't have to take them out on leashes every time they need a potty break, which can be a lot more work (trust me, I did it for a year). Does your boyfriend live with you? Having two people in the household is a plus because then there isn't just you available to let the dog out if you can't come home for lunch or something.\", 'I work at a big box chain pet store. We have over a hundred tanks that all share the same water system (plus the separate feeder fish system that houses comets and minnows). I generally work in a different area of the store but help out with the fish a lot because I used to work in the fish department and I enjoy spending time over there. I have a small tank of my own and went to pick up a guppy I was interested as I was leaving for the day. Unfortunately I noticed he was not doing well, which saddened and confused me because I had seen him not an hour earlier and he was perfectly healthy and beautiful. I walked further down the wall and noticed there was definitely a bigger problem than that. \\n At least half the fish were already dead and more were struggling at the surface. While it\\'s normal to have a few dead fish here and there since we have so many and had just got a new shipment yesterday, I knew something was really wrong. I ran back to the sump and one of my fellow employees had already noticed a problem as well. The water in the sump was foamy and \"dirty\" looking. We started a water change and tested the water but it was too late already. Almost all the fish were dead. \\n I grabbed some cups and started scooping out the fish that looked like they might have a chance. Some oscars, bigger goldfish, gouramis, and plecos. Unfortunately about half of those fish ended up dying even once I set up smaller 10 gallon tanks for them with fresh water and stress coat, but a few look like they may survive. Some of the fish I had removed to try and save began to bleed from their gills before dying. \\n Currently, according to the manufacturer of the system who was contacted by my manager when we noticed the problem and were struggling to find an answer (and which I suspected immediately as well) the prevailing theory is that someone (presumably a customer or disgruntled ex-employee?) poisoned the system by pouring something into the tanks when they were unattended. This would have been relatively easy to do as there were only two people working in that department who could have been helping other customers and not noticed. The tank lids are not locked either and we have no security cameras. And because the entire system shares the same water if something was dumped in one tank it would have been redistributed throughout all the tanks pretty quickly. We will probably never find out who did it but have taken samples of the water for testing to hopefully find out exactly what happened. \\n I am just completely disheartened by this entire event. To see even one fish die in your own tank is saddening but to witness a massacre like this and feel powerless to help is unfathomable.

Anyway, with the muzzle on I found that it took away 1) my fear she would bite a dog and 2) her need to confront the new dog in this manner right off the bat. After introducing her to dogs with the muzzle on a few times she got a lot better.

It\\'s also a much easier problem to solve, and tricks me into feeling productive when I do solve it. \\n \\n My boss told me to read up on Naive Bayesian classifiers, which I did, so I\\'m probably the most knowledgeable about how to classify stuff. However, as far as I know, I have no classes in which to put stuff (if I had the EventIDs, I\\'d imagine it\\'d be massively useful to be able to classify things into events...) I\\'m actually a bit unsure about what I  could  do...I guess I could make a model to predict the reading of one sensor based on the readings of the other--but when would that be useful? If you can get all but one reading, odds are you can get the last one too.

I started teaching myself Lisp as an independent study at school this year. My current project is to make a tic-tac-toe engine (done), and a genetically-created AI (in progress). \\n While working on the genetic programming, I was kinda scared. So I started with the easy bits and worked my way up: \\n Here\\'s this function which accepts a list of chromosomes, a minimum number to have in an individual, and a maximum number. It returns a random assortment of chromosomes as a list of length between the min and max. I still didn\\'t know what  exactly  I would be using as a chromosome. Would it just be a quoted chunk of code? Or something more complex? \\n Here\\'s this function which accepts a list of individuals, pairs them off, picks a winner, pairs off all the winners...and so forth until One Champion remains. I\\'m still not sure what an individual will be. \\n Oh shoot, now I need a function to compare two individuals. When I wrote it on Friday, I wanted results  fast . So I just made a dummy function that would return a if a was even, or else b. \\n The  pop!  I run  (evolve (make-population (loop for i from 1 to 100 collecting i))) ;this is slightly simplified , which made a bunch of individuals who were no more than a list of chromosomes--which were just integers themselves. And I got  \\'(2 7 3 3 4)  back as the winner, which makes sense, since its first digit is even (remember the  compare  function?) \\n The thing is--there were some bugs that cropped up. But since everything was still pretty short and simple, it was easy enough to fix them. \\n Were I using a typed language, I probably wouldn\\'t have been able to test anything--nay, I probably wouldn\\'t have been able to  write  anything--until I figured out exactly what types I was going to be passing around. But since I\\'m quite new to genetic programming, I wouldn\\'t have been able to know what types I wanted until I\\'d written the functions that were supposed to act on them. \\n I guess one solution would be to modify the types as I went along. To start with integers and then change them to something more complex. But wouldn\\'t that be kind of sloppy? \\n I\\'m sorry if I came off as arrogant--I\\'m not trying to be, I promise. It\\'s that of the three languages I know--Python, Java, and Common Lisp (sort of)--only Java has static, explicit typing. And it beats you over the head with it until you bleed. I\\'m assuming that the typing in Haskell or ML is friendlier...I just don\\'t know how, and am generally curious about what \"the other side\" thinks.', 'One of my CS profs wrote his own textbook which covers the very basics of functional programming. He includes a section which compares it to OOP, in which he says that FP makes extending behavior easy but creating new datatypes hard, and OOP makes creating  datatypes easy but extending behavior hard. To wit, he has a toy problem which defines types  Cat  and  Dog , and operations  makeHappyNoise()  and  makeAngryNoise() , which return \"hiss\" or \"purr\" or \"bark\" or what have you. With OOP, it\\'s easy to make a  Chicken  class with the appropriate methods, but undesirable to make a new method  makeExcitedNoise()  since it involves editing the  Cat  and  Dog  classes. \\n With FP (and he used SML), he had something along the lines of: \\n datatype Animal = Cat | Dog;\\nfun makeHappyNoise Cat = \"purr\"\\n  | makeHappyHoise Dog = \"pant pant\";\\n...\\n \\n So, of course, adding  Chicken  as a possible datatype involves tacking new patterns to all the existing functions. In the last paragraph of the section, he mentioned that the visitor pattern helped solve the problem nicely. \\n I recently went in during office hours and suggested that CLOS had what seems like an optimal solution, and showed him [the generic methods I\\'m sure you can imagine]( He hadn\\'t really seen that before, was interested, asked me to send him a copy of the source code, and suggested he might put in a line about CLOS in the textbook. Cool. \\n As a sidenote--do you think this is a fair representation of OOP, FP, and CLOS? I feel like there should be some sort of FP solution with functors or monads or typeclasses whatnot, but I\\'m ignorant about it. \\n \\n Now, a few weeks later, in a different course (Software Development), we\\'ve been learning design patterns. Today he taught us Visitor. He enjoys posing a problem, demonstrating intuitive solutions (\"tries\"), and then having Try 3 or so be the \"correct\" way of doing things. So Try 1 featured an  if (foo instanceof Bar) baz(); else if (foo instanceof Quux) frobnicate();  mess. Try 2 featured, effectively, what would be multiple dispatch. He asked us what the problem was. I said that it didn\\'t work in Java, and suggested that the world would be a better place if it did. \\n So he acknowledged that there were languages that supported that, but that none of them had really gained any popularity, and he then proceeded to defend Java\\'s dispatching system. I pressed him about it, and the only substance I got was: \\n \\n The fact that Lisp doesn\\'t have as extensive static checking as Java worries him. \\n \\n There are cases where he finds multiple dispatch precedence unclear. If A and B implement I, and X and Y implement J, and we have  (defgeneric m ((a A) (j J)) \\'foo)   (defgeneric m ((i I) (x X) \\'bar) , then he says  (m (make-instance \\'A) (make-instance \\'X))  is undefined. I didn\\'t know how to answer that this morning, but have since then figured out that ties are broken by the order of the arguments. \\n \\n \\n I\\'m too laid back to freak out about #1, and feel like #2 is equivalent to advocating the use of hand drills for everything since electric ones have a higher accident rate. So I left the class thoroughly unimpressed with the visitor pattern. \\n But he\\'s a smart guy, with much more experience than I have, and it seems hard for me to believe that the mainstream software architecture community is so completely unsympathetic toward multiple dispatch. Are there any benefits to Visitor or downsides to multimethods that I\\'m not seeing? \\n More generally, how does this play out in the real world? In my pastebin it was all very nice that I could append whatever I needed to the end of my source file, but in more complex situations that could get really messy. Are things grouped by class? By method? Helter-skelter? \\n Have you ever had issues with the compiler not catching silly type errors that ended up burning you? Have you ever been confused by Lisp\\'s dispatching? Is it sometimes helpful to have  visit()  and  accept()  written out explicitly? How helpful is it to have a toolbox full of design patterns, rather than a toolbox full of language features?

Not fair. \\n From what I understand, tights, leggings, skirts, dresses, and boots can all be massively comfortable--and are all pretty much unobtainable for guys. Also, were a girl to get somewhat-dressy while still wearing pants, it'd probably involve flats, pants, and a glorified tshirt. Guys would wear clodhopper shoes, pants, an Oxford-cloth shirt (fully buttoned), and a tie. \\n So if someone were to make a density curve of clothing comfort, I think the female one would have longer/higher tails in both directions. \\n I've occasionally borrowed some kind of sweatshirt/jacket from a girl, and felt like the inside material was the same as normal. But I actually liked the closer fit (especially in the sleeves) more. \\n Final note: Girl in guy sweatshirt/pants/tshirt/whatever: publicly perceived as being okay. Guy in girl whatever--even if it's just the wrong cut of pants or tshirt: publicly perceived as being gay, a predator, or both.\", \"Background \\n I'm a CS undergrad particularly interested in AI, and have gotten my feet wet with ML through internships, Stanford's online AI course, and a job I have at a startup doing simple text mining and less-simple searching (and I'm also learning through osmosis as the software company I have a summer job at just got acquired by IBM's Big Data division). I'm also incredibly interested in 18th-century Scottish fiddle music, and my chief hobby for the past six years has been playing, composing, and otherwise studying it. \\n I've noticed that there's a lot of patterns in the tunes. The vast majority are 32 bars (measures), there's a handful of patterns that make ~5 unique bars get repeated in such a way as to fill the 32 (one common idiom is playing ABAC ABAC DEDC DEDC twice, where each letter represents a bar). And when playing a tune I've never seen or heard before, I sometimes have correct intuitions about what new content will come next--there's a lot of melodic and chordal patterns whose precise nature I can't quite articulate. \\n Project \\n So as any sensible person would do when faced with vague theories and good data sources, I want to package up several thousand tunes in [ABC notation]( cause my computer to do incantations over them, look at the patterns my program finds out of pure musicological interest, and then use them to generate new tunes. \\n Now it's time for the question : do you know of any previously done work on something similar? I've spent a good amount of time trying to find things, but can only find audio-based projects. I'm not interested in analyzing the genre of an MP3 or contrasting the performance style of two artists. Nor am I interested in smashing together several loops of electronic sound and calling it music. This is a strictly sheet music-based project. \\n Practical Details \\n From a logistics standpoint, I'd have a little bit of time this upcoming academic year to work on it (on the side), and if I wanted to I could have about twelve 20-40 hour weeks in the summer of 2013. In the summer and fall of 2013 I plan to be in Edinburgh studying ethnomusicology (yay, domain knowledge). I'm also thinking of applying to the [Singularity Institute]( and spending a week or two there in the beginning of the summer--if anyone has any thoughts on that I'd be interested in hearing them. \\n By asking about prior work I'm hoping someone will link me to a journal article where I'll learn what algorithms other people have used and how (un)successful that was--which would give me a place to start. If that doesn't work out: \\n Current Strategy \\n First I'll create a hierarchy of things I'm interested in. One group might be broadly responsible for the overall structure of a tune, and I'll have one node recording data on length, another node recording data on which patterns of repeated bars are used, etc. Another top-level group might be broadly responsible for figuring out what type of note comes after what, with nodes that keep track of intervals (be it a minor third or a fifth or whatever), chord patterns, relative position in the bar, relative position in the tune, relationship to the key signature, etc. And so on and so forth. This obviously requires a lot of thought, and I'd like to try as much as possible to make things specific enough to be easily findable in the corpus, but abstract enough to be useful in a broader context. Then I'll run the corpus through them to get the actual data, inspect the results, probably iterate on that a few times as I realize what type of information is more valuable than others, and then feed it all to a glorified Markov chain generator for the composition aspect. \\n \\n I've done my best not to make an imposing wall of text, but...I wanted to make sure you had all the information you might want. The main question is about previous efforts, but anything else you'd like to add to the discussion is very welcome. Does this seem like a reasonable project? Any words of warning? I'm aware that even if everything goes perfectly according to plan and I have an automatic traditional tune spitter-outer the usefulness is questionable (not much of a market to monetize it with, and it seems a bit out there to go the academic route with)...it's purely for personal interest, pragmatism be darned. \\n Thanks!\", 'Unfortunately, [this]( is a lot more representative. \\n Serious snipers use scopes with either mil (milliradian) or moa (minute of angle) dot reticules. That is, just a Cartesian plane on the scope. Then, in their pocket, they have a small notebook/binder affair with scratch paper, a calculator, and a range card that details how fast a given bullet drops and how it reacts to wind. \\n The actual aiming involves: \\n \\n measuring the size of the target in mils/moas and using math to calculate the range. For example, a 2 yard man 1.3 mils high is 2*1000/1.3=1540 yards away. \\n \\n Looking up how many mils/moas the bullet will drop at 1540 yards, and  dialing in that number on the elevation turret, a small knob that adjusts where the scope points. \\n \\n Using a  kestrel  are also important for slight up/down adjustments. Once the mil/moa value is found, it\\'s either dialed into the windage turret, or used to \"hold over\" the sighting, that is, putting the, say, 3 mil reticle on the target, instead of the center of the crosshairs. \\n \\n Further voodoo if the target is moving.

Kiritsugu matches Saber's altruism but is a foil to her ideals of honour, and in a similar relationship Archer matches Saber's honour but is a foil to her altruism. They both believe strongly in a fundamental difference between a king and his subjects, and in a tie of fealty that must be honoured between the two. But where Saber is completely altruistic in that she owes everything she has to those beneath her, Gilgamesh is perfectly egoistic in that everybody beneath him owes everything to him. \\n There are important comparisons you can make between almost any two characters.

It was either Chelsea or Kurome, but Kurome still had an important role in the story. Still her death could have not been so rude... \\n Seryu:  Necessary. After what she did to Sheele she had to be punished. \\n Lubbock:  Necessary. They got caught by the Empire's stronger generals, no way he could escape (unfortunately...) \\n Syura:  Unnecessary. In the anime his actions are not as evil, and I don't think it was much relevant for the plot progression even though he deserved it... \\n Budo:  Necessary. If he was still alive, Night Raid would probably not raid the capital to take down the Empire. \\n Susanoo:  Necessary. It was either Susanoo or Esdeath would probably take down one or two other members from Night Raid (if not more) \\n Mine:  Unnecessary. Her death was kind of weird and it was totally unnecessary. Sure, it might have totally changed Tatsumi's mind, but she didn't have to die, she could have just got the manga treatment... \\n Kurome:  Necessary. It was really important for the plot progression in the anime. \\n Tatsumi:  Unnecessary. Super Sayian Tats could stop the Shikoutazer by himself. If some other strong characters joined him, maybe he could have survived. \\n Esdeath:  Necessary. I don't think I even need to explain this one... \\n Leone:  Unnecessary. The war was over already, we didn't need more deaths, why did they even keep the slaughter?!\", \"Basically the Homunculus were created from human transmutations, but in the anime, not every of their creations is explained. So, how were the remaining Homunculus (Gluttony, Greed and Pride) created? I saw the wiki page but couldn't find answers apart from being created by Dante, but they probably result from a failed transmutation, right? So there is most likely not a canon answer to my question, but is there any plausible theory or something? Also, the Homunculus are meant to represent one of the seven deadly sins, but I fail to find the connection between Trisha and sloth... The wikia has an explanation for that, which says she didn't kill her sons and friends whenever she had the opportunity, also she only attacked with one arm while the rest of her body kept immobile. And the water powers coming from a current never flowing its path. Honestly, I don't think this is a plausible explanation for her sin or her power. Not killing her sons might be due to the fact she still holds memories about them, or they might even be a weakness to her. Neither does staying idle while attacking means she represent sloth... she has long range abilities it's no use to get into melee range when she is stronger in a wider range. And if her enemies can't reach her, there is no need to keep moving. Personally, I think she should be Pride, but the Fuhrer would not give a good Sloth either... Apart from Sloth, the other Homunculus are a better representation of their sins, at least imo. So, what do you think about Trisha being Sloth? Is there any other evidence that she is a good representation of Sloth?\", \"So there's something bugging me about Itachi... Before I mention it I need to say that I'm only at chapter 551 so it might be something explained later or maybe it was already answered here but I couldn't find it. So, what is bugging me is... I already know all of Itachi's intentions to protect his brother and the leaf, including his first approach with Kisame to capture the Nine-Tails. But, if his real intentions on that approach were to threaten Danzo, why did he simply followed Naruto to Shukuba Town? Was it only to keep his cover or did he had another intention behind it? If it was only to keep his cover I don't think it was a good plan, since Akatsuki's goal with the jinchuriki could possibly harm Sasuke in the future. I recall seeing somewhere (although I can't find any sources of it) that he wanted to protect Naruto, but if he was going to capture him and deliver him to Akatsuki that's not a very good protection. There is a last possibility that he only cared about Sasuke and nothing else, but that doesn't seem true since he did so much to protect the leaf, and as I said retrieving Naruto to Akatsuki could also harm Sasuke. So what are Itachi's real intentions in his first approach to the leaf?\", \"So, this is probably posted a lot of times, I apologize for that, also I think I could have found an answer myself if I searched harder, but sometimes the best answer comes from the fans of a show, since it's more subjective. Basically, I wanted to start watching Gintama, but I see so many animes and spin-offs with the same name that I don't know where to start and which order to follow.

Everyone carries a different baggage of experience with them and will, sooner or later, start from different assumptions about reality, and that irrevocably leads to different conclusions that are irreconcilable with our own conclusions. The fact that other people hold beliefs that I think are false does not mean that they are automatically irrational in holding those beliefs.', \"What kind of therapy did you get? What you're describing sounds suspiciously like social anxiety disorder. The best way to tackle it is through cognitive-behavioral therapy, which I think is best done under the supervision of a therapist but you could also try it by yourself. \\n The behavioral part is simply exposing yourself to social situations. The cognitive part is that you challenge the various cognitions/ideas that your mind automatically brings up when you come across social situations. \\n Social anxiety is a self-fulfilling prophecy: when you automatically assume the worst in social situations, you get anxious and start behaving as such, and people may notice that and then think you're weird, and that will only confirm your suspicions. And then you go back home and spend the rest of the day worrying about other people's perception of you. \\n The key is to break through this vicious circle. Challenge your automatic social defense system whenever it comes up: how do you know other people think badly of you? How do you know they spend most of their time thinking about how embarassing you are? Are you a mindreader? Don't buy the answer that your mind automatically generates. \\n People accidentily do embarassing things in front of others all the time; they really don't spend excessive amounts of time thinking about  your  actions, and they've probably come across many persons who acted much weirder than you ever will.\", \"Here's an interesting thought I had last night. I was thinking about how lots of people make new accounts to ask for help here, because they apparently think it is an embarassing thing to ask and they have grown fond of the identity that is attached to their normal accountname, so they don't want to bring that down by doing something embarassing. \\n Note that just as with SA, there's an overestimation of how much people care about what you do and say. It's extremely likely no one will care (and most probably won't even take notice) when you post using your older account as opposed to a new one, unless 1) you post so much on reddit that you've become as popular as eg. Shitty_Watercolour, or 2) you happen to be the victim of an extremely rare case of stalking. Just as in real life, people are absorbed in their own little worlds, with their own hopes, fears, worries, etc. and will rarely spend more than a few seconds thinking about  you  and what you said and did in front of them, let alone minutes or even hours (while, just as you, they do spend a lot of time scrutinizing their own actions and words and hopes and fears and what not). \\n So people like using a new account because it's completely anonymous and they can be certain that other people don't know much or anything about them except what they post with that new account. \\n Here's the thing:  your day to day life is not much different from that state of pure anonymity. \\n You come across lots of people who don't know you, just as when you're anonymous. They might notice a few things about you, maybe even things that are embarassing, but from one moment to the next they'll have forgotten you, and soon after that won't be able to identify you anymore if they came across you again. \\n Then there are people who are acquainted with you or friends, but to what extent do they know the real you? Can they look inside your head, see your fears and hopes and dreams and desires, do they know what defines you? They can stick a label (name) to your appearance and perhaps say a bit about what kind of person you are, but appearances are fluid and personality descriptions are often flawed.\", 'Personally? I think lots of these supposedly rational people hold to various hidden assumptions and ways of thinking that come down to scientism and naturalistic reductionism. Scientism in the sense that only (empirical) science can give us valid/legitimate knowledge, reductionism in the sense that everything must be explained and in the end reduced to natural phenomena. These assumptions are very rarely actually argued for; sometimes there\\'s a vacuous appeal to utility (\"well science works\"). \\n Or maybe it\\'s not so much hidden assumptions but a clear bias towards these two ideas. This is why eg. often on threads on the ontological argument, you\\'ll see comments like \"deductively this seems air tight, that means there must be a problem with how language functions. You can\\'t just speak God into existence like that\". When the argument leads to a conclusion that conflicts with scientism and naturalism, the people who cherish these assumptions will try to find ... unconventional ways to be able to disregard the argument anyway. \\n And frankly, whether you want to call it \"being religious\" or not, it\\'s pretty clear that for many, many atheists their being an atheist has become an important part of their identity that they cherish, an important group identifier especially on these online forums. And an important result of having a group identity is inevitably that you tend to disregard bad arguments for your own side and good arguments for the opposing side. The vast majority swallows whatever Dawkins, Hitchens et al. say without giving it much thought; critical rationalism is selectively applied. You\\'re as likely to find posts on atheist forums detailing the various flaws and mistakes in the books by Dawkins, Harris etc. as you will find posts on Christian forums detailing discrepancies in the Bible. \\n In the end, religious and non-religious people are not so different from eachother at all, certainly not in this regard. Of course, that these people are described as being, rational, logical, scientific, skeptical etc. is (as I said above) not reflective of how they actually behave, but this is part of the narrative (or myth if you will) they tell about their own identity.', 'I wanted to flesh out why I like Doran Martell so much. One reason is that he has kept Dorne out of the war until now,  and  he has a good heart for both his people and his family (this sets him apart from Littlefinger, who is pretty much the only other ruler whose kingdom so far has been left untouched by war). \\n Another reason, however, is Doran\\'s strategy in the game of thrones. One thing that is apparent when reading what other people think about the prince of Dorne is that he is invariably described as weak. Especially those close to him, eg. Arianne and the sand snakes, say that he does nothing, he thinks too much, he only delays, he is feeble. In his ADWD chapter, Areo Hotah notes that half the Dornish lords want to go to war and that they think that Doran is weak. Harry Strickland (Golden Company) later notes that Doran is \"scared of his own shadow. Not what you call daring.\" \\n However, this is in stark contrast with what Doran is actually plotting to do. In the Arianne reveal chapter in AFFC: \\n > I have worked at the downfall of Tywin Lannister since the day they told me of Elia and her children. It was my hope to strip him of all that he held most dear before I killed him, but it would seem his dwarf son has robbed me of that pleasure. I take some small solace in knowing that he died a cruel death at the hands of the monster that he himself begot. \\n And in ADWD when talking with the sand snakes: \\n > I am not blind, nor deaf. I know that you all believe me weak, frightened, feeble. Your father knew me better. Oberyn was ever the viper. Deadly, dangerous, unpredictable. No man dared tread on him. I was the grass. Pleasant, complaisant, sweet-smelling, swaying with every breeze. Who fears to walk upon the grass? But it is the grass that hides the viper from his enemies and shelters him until he strikes. Your father and I worked more closely than you know \u2026 but now he is gone. The question is, can I trust his daughters to serve me in his place? \\n The grass comparison makes it clear that Doran only feigns to be an insipid ruler. In AFFC, for example, he tells the kingsguard Arys Oakheart that he thinks he himself is \"frail and failing, and sometimes... Sunspear wearies me, with its noise and dirt and smells. As soon as my duty allows, I mean to return to the Water Gardens.\" But this talk of duty is nonsense of course, since Doran has been planning for many years to take revenge on the Lannisters  - a plan which has recently come into its main phase when Tyrion decided to send Myrcella to Dorne and to give the Dornish a seat on the small council. He is already actively executing this plan, which he had so long desired to do, at the moment he has this conversation with Arys. \\n So what game does Doran play? He presents himself as a frail prince, so that firstly he hasn\\'t had to involve Dorne in the war so far - giving him the great advantage of having his enemies kill eachother, and having his army (not to mention finances and food stores) still fully intact whereas half of Westeros is now devastated. It\\'s an excuse to not be involved. Secondly, people see that he is doing nothing and think he is not much of a threat whereas he is in secret hatching various schemes and forging alliances wherever they can be found, to further strengthen his position. And now the viper that is Dorne is ready to strike from the grass. \\n > Sometimes it is best to study a game before you attempt to play it. My brother loved the fight for its own sake, but I only play such games as I can win.', \"I understand where you are coming from. Historically, there is no basis to suggest that Buddhism was any less supernatural than other religions. Indeed, it seems to have been pretty typically Indian and incorporated various Indian mythological beings in its philosophical ideas, whether gods, demi-gods, spiritual beings, demons, ghosts or other creatures. \\n However, I don't think it is so much of a problem that many or even most western buddhists are atheists. Buddhism has never been (primarily) about doctrines and beliefs, but about practices. Monks were kicked out of monasteries because they broke the rules, not because they held unorthodox beliefs; indeed, the very concept of heresy is simply not applicable to buddhism. I think a better litmus test, if there has to be one, is whether one meditates regularly. \\n Nonetheless it would be better if western buddhists were more aware of the heritage of early buddhism that is shared by all major buddhist traditions. To that end, I cannot recommend [The Foundations of Buddhism]( by Rupert Gethin enough.\", \"in so much sci-fi and forward looking aspects of academia, there seems to be the idea that eventually humanity will just wise up and forget about Christianity or religion in general. \\n This is known as the secularization hypothesis in the sociology of religion. Lots of sociologists abandoned it after the early 1980's, when it became apparent that religion was not gradually declining in large parts of the world - think of the Moral Majority and fundamentalism increasing in popularity in the US, the islamic revolution in Iran, etc. There are still sociologists who hold to it, but also a lot who reject it and it certainly is not as obviously true as it used to be a couple of decades ago. \\n In an increasingly globalized world, people seem to fall back on religion in order to help them deal with new developments, being confronted with other people, other nationalities, other religions, etc. One can include economic developments in this. \\n One also has to consider the fact that secularism is correlated with much lower birth rates, to the extent that many western countries have declining populations. Secular societies don't really seem viable - they are dependent upon immigrants from outside in order to keep a stable population. Of course, these outsiders tend to be more religious (as do those couples in western societies that  do  produce more than 2 children). \\n It often seems to us westerners that religion is on the decline, but while that may be so in Europe and the US we should keep in mind that religion is fully alive, maybe even growing, in most of the rest of the world.

The only reason you would defend amateurs would be because I was saying something negative about them, when I never did.  I even said this at the end of my post: \\n >\", \"I don't necessarily think this is a bad post, but I do think it's irrelevant. \\n The questions here aren't about family or bonding.  You can get that somewhere else.  Questions here are supposed to be about how to cook, and that's best explained by a professional.  I'm not saying only a professional can give a good answer, but put equal parts of pros and amateurs together, and you'll get better answers, in general, from the pros. \\n >Good home cooks know their ingredients, the folks at their tables, and the limits of their equipment. It's a different game. \\n It's really not, at least from this standpoint.  The same holds true in a professional kitchen.  We know our ingredients, we know our customers (maybe not intimately, but enough to get them coming back), and we know the limits of our equipment. A professional kitchen is definitely a different beast, but how to cook is the same. There's still a science and reasoning behind the answers.\", 'A qualifier like that isn\\'t always a bad thing, and sometimes, is necessary to distinguish the difference. \\n Taking your example, if I\\'m not in Chicago and I see deep dish on a menu, what kind of deep dish are we talking?  Is it a thicker pizza that still has sauce on the bottom and cheese on top, or is it going to be the reverse?  It\\'s hard to tell which style I\\'m getting  unless  I\\'m actually in Chicago.  If that\\'s the case, anyone specifying that it\\'s Chicago-style is just being silly, because if you\\'re in Chicago, that\\'s what you should expect. \\n Being from Connecticut, we have some others.  New Haven has their own style of pizza that\\'s different from New York.  If you aren\\'t in New Haven (or in NY, I suppose), then the restaurant might specify the style so that you know which you\\'re getting.  It doesn\\'t make it bad pizza, it\\'s just to clarify.  And speaking of, when I lived in Santa Monica, we had a place that had both NY and Chicago style pizzas, and that\\'s how it was described on the menu.  Since it\\'s so far removed, it\\'s the only way to know the style of the pizza being ordered. \\n There\\'s also the lobster roll - the original is hot with butter, and it\\'s CT-style, but it\\'s never called that.  It\\'s usually just called \"hot,\" although if it said \"CT-style,\" I would know what they were talking about and wouldn\\'t feel put off from it.  For the cold style with mayo, that would be a \"cold lobster roll\" or \"lobster salad roll,\" or \"New England lobster roll.\"  The name in front is just to specify that it\\'s in that style.  If I weren\\'t in CT or New England, I\\'d want a qualifier (or menu description) to know if that\\'s what I\\'m getting or if it\\'s something entirely different. \\n In Philly, it makes sense not to say \"Philly cheesesteak\" because you\\'re in Philly, and if it\\'s a cheesesteak, that\\'s what you should get.  But outside of Philly, I wouldn\\'t say it\\'s necessary, but if it happens, it\\'s not a guarantee that it won\\'t be good.  There might be a correlation in quality, but it\\'s also a buzzword to a lot of people (outside of Philly), so it might make sense for a restaurant to put that part in there.', \"Salted butter is meant for things where it's used as an added flavor to a dish...not really sure what to call it.  But basically for things like toast or muffins, as a couple examples, salted butter is the way to go.  Try some unsalted butter on toast, and it's okay, but you need that salt! \\n The whole point of unsalted butter is to give you control.  So if you have a recipe for cookies, you want to make it the same way every time, and you want anyone to be able to replicate the recipe.  You don't really have that freedom of taste and adjust that you have in cooking (unless you're  really  experienced).  So by using unsalted butter, you have complete control over the salt content.\", 'My responses to you were not prickish at all.  I\\'m sorry if you take bluntness as being a prick, but it\\'s really not.  It may seem harsh to you, and I\\'m honestly sorry if it does, but you may want to develop a thicker skin if you think being straight up is offensive. \\n Pretty much every single person I\\'ve ever met that has at least made it to sous chef has an idea of restaurant food cost, not just of their restaurant, but of the industry in general.  Everyone beyond that really knows what they\\'re doing.  I\\'ve met only one exception, and turns out, she\\'s a glorified cook.  Nothing wrong with that, but point being, executive chef or owner is basically a guarantee of having an understanding of food cost.  This includes you. \\n So here you come in, an owner, and you want to clear up a common misconception, and that\\'s awesome.  You\\'re likely going to be considered an expert, and honestly, I have  no problem at all  with your posting your specific information.  However, unless you point out  how your restaurant is not standard , it\\'s a  very poor way  to prove a point, especially if you\\'re trying to imply that this is standard across the industry.  Just saying \"this is my restaurant\" is not enough, because you never said that your restaurant is different than the average restaurant.  Yes, it\\'s accurate for your restaurant, but that wasn\\'t the point of your post, was it?  Your post was to point out a common misconception - how can you disprove a common misconception with an uncommon example? \\n >Typically, a restaurant will shoot for a food cost of ~35%-38%. Sodas are slightly more profitable, but nowhere near the level people seem to think. \\n This just isn\\'t true at all.  We\\'ve already gone over the food cost and why yours might be different.  You\\'re using your specific food cost as the example for an entire industry, along with equipment cost included in the price of the beverage.  This is why I made that comment to the culinary student - he obviously values your opinion, but he\\'s being fed incorrect information, and I don\\'t think that\\'s cool.  You may think I\\'m a prick for pointing that out, but I think what you\\'re doing is worse. \\n And let\\'s look at the soda thing for a typical restaurant that\\'s out of a reusable glass - water is not going to be included anyway, and neither is the ice machine.  All you\\'re including is the cost of syrup.  If the average person drinks say 16oz (honestly guessing here) of straight up soda, and you\\'re looking at $.017/oz, then we\\'re looking at just $.272 per soda.  Even at your $1.69, we\\'re looking at a beverage cost of about 16% (although I\\'d say at least ~$2 is more likely, making it only ~13.6%). \\n And yes, I understand that you said it was your own restaurant, but you also said this at the beginning: \\n >This is a self-repost to  clear up an extremely common misconception \\n This means your post is going to apply to the typical restaurant by using your own as an example.  Why do I say this?  Because you can\\'t clear up a misconception  unless it\\'s the standard .  I mean, imagine you sold your soda for $.75 instead.  Would that still clear up the misconception?  Of course not, that\\'s an outlier, not the standard.  Specific examples are only good if they\\'re near the average, which yours clearly isn\\'t. \\n >', 'This is actually a really tough question to answer! And I will say it depends, not as a cop out, but because a bun is hard to emulate, so really, you need to find something else. \\n So first off, there are some replacement rolls that can be made, and there are a ton of different recipes, such as \"oopsie rolls.\"  If you like stuff like that, then you could work on finding a recipe that emulates a bun. \\n But for me...a big part of it is about eating differently.  I don\\'t mind eating vegetarian sometimes, I don\\'t always  need  to have meat in my meals.  But if I do that, I\\'m not doing it with replacement proteins.  There\\'s nothing wrong with that, but if I want to eat a veg meal, I don\\'t do it with fake chicken and beef.  I just eat heartier, protein rich plant food.  So for me, it\\'s not so much of a replacement as it is finding a new way to enjoy foods so that I don\\'t  need  the replacement. \\n Anyway, some options for the burger - the typical solution is just to wrap in lettuce.  A lot of people like iceberg, although romaine (or any large leaf) should work well, too.  When I live in Cali, sometimes I\\'d get my burger protein style at In-n-Out, which meant no bun.  I honestly didn\\'t miss it.  I felt less bloated after a meal.  Felt great, actually! \\n Then there was a place that I went to where you can choose all these different toppings.  I got my burger on some greens and picked a ton of toppings (that worked together, of course).   What was cool is if you have a huge burger, it\\'s hard to eat, all the toppings fall off, and you can\\'t really eat it properly.  Without the bun, you can load them on and get everything in each bite.  So you trade out the bun, but trade in the customization.  I enjoy that trade-off, and I feel better afterward, too. \\n I realized that I tend to take a lot of sandwich items and just put them on some greens.  It\\'s really pretty great in my opinion.  I love bread, don\\'t get me wrong, but after a salad loaded with whatever protein and fat, I feel content.  After a big sandwich, I feel stuffed.  I still eat bread now, but try to cut it out when I can.  I just feel better if I don\\'t eat it. \\n Sorry if I rambled.  If something doesn\\'t make sense, just let me know and I\\'ll respond back in the morning.', \"Add salt!  Cooking is all about seasoning.  Always taste and adjust, both throughout the process and at the end.  Just be mindful of things like reductions.  If you're going to reduce a sauce, then know that  everything  will be more concentrated, meaning you should be careful with your salt so it doesn't get too strong by the end.  But if it's not salty when it's finished cooking, then by all means, add some salt!  One thing that I've noticed, though, is if you're salting something with a lot of fat, then the salt may not distribute evenly right away, so in that case, you might need to give it a bit of time to sort of adjust itself.  For everything else, it's usually pretty quick. \\n But anyway, salt has a habit of, in some sense, masking the bitter flavors.  As an example, get some grapefruit and sprinkle some salt on it.  I think you'd be surprised how sweet it tastes after you do that. \\n The beans might add a bit of sweetness, but won't get rid of that lingering bitterness.  The chili powders will provide heat, but shouldn't add any bitterness.  The beer, even if it was a more bitter beer, shouldn't make much of a difference at all, at least not one that you would notice that much at the end.  Unless it was incredibly bitter going in, then it's not the issue.  Oregano is delicious, and I tend to add way too much, so no issues there! You have other bitter or bitter tasting compounds in the chili, such as the cocoa powder and even the molasses, but the salt should help to bring out the sweetness and take away that lingering bitterness.   Also, after you make your chili, cool it down and store it until the next day.  It'll taste way better!\"]": "Based on the reddit posting history, the user seems to be interested in cooking and food.", "[\"You gotta tweak the settings a little.

This was followed by the ESRB re-rating the game as AO instead of M. Resulting in a full recall of the game. Rockstar then re-released the game without the content and re-gained the M-rating for the game.

Now, I don't know if it was just luck or what, but I just finished a game(on easy admittedly) where everything just went horribly right, and felt like sharing. \\n Fresh out of finishing my first game on easy with the Man o War I figured I'd try out the Osprey. Within the third or fourth sector I already had it fit with the base burst laser along with the burst laser III and an ion blaster on top of the main beam. Not only that I picked up the Zoltan cruiser along the way and filled out my crew. I even had to turn down at least 4 extra crew members including Zaraaak when I picked up the Mantis ship. Now, when I say horribly good, that's because of what happened when I tried to pick up the Rock ship.

Up till now I've been afraid to turn up the difficulty because the occasional boss will give me some serious trouble, but this changed my mind about that. Also, I'm currently playing on Adept, so I'll be switching up to expert.\\nSo I stumbled upon the Gauldur Amulet quest when I was on my way to Solitude for the first time.  After rifling through the camp outside the dungeon and discovering the book that starts the quest I decided to delay my trip to Solitude for a little dungeon delving fun with Benor, my companion. At first it was nothing but a bit of looting, but after a while we started seeing a few Draugr. I easily took their lives(or unlives?) and occasionally their souls with my homecrafted Night Mother's Breeze(glass bow with a fiery soul trap enchantment). After reaching the corpse of the mage searching for the amulet, the number of Draugr increased. I let the bridge fall, and before the Draugr on the other side could react, both lay fell to the ground with an arrow in their chests. As I entered the next room, around 6 of the undead fiends stepped from their coffins as the heard the heavy clatter of Brenor's boots. Unfortunately for them, they didn't notice me, and each fell before even reaching Brenor.\\nAfter clearing out a few more fiends, we found ourselves in a hallway lined with coffins, and at the end was the spinning door in which to place the claw. Feeling excited, we quickly stepped forward only for all the torchlight to suddenly vanish. Around us, the 8 coffins broke open revealing their undead contents. Fortunately, my instincts stepped in as I spun around, firing a single deadly arrow into each putrid carcass. I only failed to kill one before it left its coffin, and that was because Brenor was in the way, but as the creature stepped towards him, he cleaved its skull in with an ebony waraxe. The hall grew quiet and the light flickered back to life. I glanced at the bodies as I walked by, some were laying in a way that you could almost believe they hadn't even shifted since laid to rest, if it weren't for the arrow imbedded in their shoulders. After shifting around the door we stepped into the final resting place of the holder of the amulet. Sensing the seal on the door breaking, he rose from his grave, calling almost a dozen more to rise from the room around as well. Seeing an opportunity, I fired an arrow which struck him straight through the heart. Any ordinary creature would have been dead right then, but fortunately for him blood no longer flowed through his veins. As he reeled from the first shot I notched and let fly another arrow. This one landed close to the liver, and withe the call of the Night Mother tugging from both shots, his soul could no longer resist. It abandoned his body and flowed into one of the many gems I had gathered from others like him. Now that the magic that had bound them here was gone, the thralls filling the room collapsed and crumbled where they stood. The air felt lighter and fresher now that these creatures were gone. I claimed the amulet as well as a few other trinkets and a word of frost before finding my way back to the entrance. Coming into the cold air I smiled. Neither Brenor nor I had suffered a single wound, save for stubbing my toe on the occasional skeleton. \\n So after all that I figured I could definitely use a little more challenge. Yeah, I have a hard time taking bosses on straight up, but as a stealth character, it's just too easy to bring them down from the shadows. What do you guys think about the difficulty? What seems too easy or too hard, and what level do you like to play on?\", \"So far my favorite was one of the dragon crash landing ones. While I haven't encountered the vertical crash like I've seen around here, I had one that was rather amusing still. I came across a frost dragon terrorizing an ice troll on a mountain path, and after a pretty dramatic battle the dragon came crashing down on top of the mountain. He had a decent amount of health left though, so I hurriedly climbed up to finish him. I came to the top and using the stairs as cover fired a few more arrows to finish him off. I did notice a few of them sticking in midair however. Finally, the dragon fell and I stepped forward to claim the soul. Problem was, an invisible wall blocked my way. His crash landing on the stairs caused the game to create an invisible wall that stopped the only easy way up. I liked this glitch mainly because it forced me to spend the next 15 minutes or so finding another way up the mountain to claim the soul and the word that was up there. \\n Also of note here, the dragon's texture glitched out during the battle and he lost both his spines and the scale pattern. After he died they returned however. \\n Most importantly is this: after claiming the soul and the word, I noticed a dead cow lying half covered in dirt at the end of the dragon's crash site. I have no idea what this cow was doing on top of a frozen mountain, but he was definitely in the wrong place at the wrong time.\", 'I am so thankful that my fiancee came into my life when she did because of this.

I love her very much, but it got to the point where if I wanted to go visit my brother next door when I\\'d visit her in the Summer that she would do everything she could to make me feel horrible and guilty enough to stay with her because leaving would be a complete betrayal. She is still raising my little half sister now and although my mom has gotten better I really worry about her because as far as I know my soon to be 15 year old sister still has a mental breakdown anytime she is left alone, and can barely manage to put together even ramen without help from our mom.

I was only next door and made sure she knew that in case she just couldn\\'t handle it or something happened, but after only trying for two days my mom yelled at me for it and forced me to stop. \\n Anyways, enough about my mom. After the second divorce I moved in with my dad. He was married to my stepmom, but they lived in different cities so for several years my dad was my sole true parent. His parenting was very open. He was loving and friendly, but I think he was just really tired after years of parenting and giving his all to his teaching job, on campus and off. I grew a lot during that time from the new experience of independence, but I lacked a lot of drive and direction. I knew I was expected to go through college like my siblings so I worked for that, but not so much because I truly wanted it as it was to just meet a basic expectation. After a few years my siblings started to move out and then my stepmom moved back together with my dad. Up until then I didn\\'t realize how much my siblings meant to me and how much we helped each other growing up. I\\'d always been at odds with my older stepsister(4 years older than me), but as soon as it was just the two us us left with the parents we became really good friends and were always there for each other. It was because my stepmom was the complete opposite of my dad. where he was laid back and friendly, she was distant, relentless and constricting. She had a very strict idea of what we could and couldn\\'t do and limited everything. She organized our chores based on what the professional maids she\\'d hired before could do, and if we were subpar it was grounding after grounding. Neither my stepsister or I ever did anything I can think of worse than going to a friend\\'s house before doing chores at that point, but she treated us like we were problem children on the verge of running off with a gang to shoot up a house. Beyond that, she expected nothing less than perfection in our school. When my brother who was working a job on top of college to support himself and his fiancee had his grades drop below 4.0 she practically disowned him even though he was giving it his all. The first time I had a B+ instead of an A she told my dad to have a talk with me and threaten punishment if it didn\\'t get any better. My dad was far too laid back through all of this and still is and basically just went along with whatever she thought and whatever she wanted. What all of this did for me was demoralize and depress me. The longer it went on the worse my grades got and the worse the punishments became. \\n I started college at 15 but it felt like the stakes just got higher with her. At this point I had a breath of fresh air though, since I stood out so much at the college. I got nothing but support from my classmates and professors and excelled in my first few years there. I discovered what I wanted to do and really felt like I had a drive. Just before college, my stepsister and lifeline had moved out, but for a while it didn\\'t get to me because of all the support at school. Then when I was 17 I hit a breaking point with my stepmom and hit the fridge with my first during one of our arguments. Only hard enough to make a loud thud, but it was the first time I\\'d done anything physically around her. That brought back childhood trauma for her though, and I went on lockdown. I wasn\\'t allowed in the house when my dad wasn\\'t home, but I also wasn\\'t allowed to see friends during this time. They had gps enabled on my phone as well to keep track of me. If my dad would go on a business trip I\\'d tag along and sit in the hotel while he was there. Worst of all, our family therapist sided with her on this and explained to me that the majority of men abused as kids would go on to abuse their mothers, wives, and children, and ended up basically saying that my stepmom\\'s fears were completely validated and she should be afraid of me because it was only a matter of time before that statistics would prove themselves true. I wasn\\'t a statistic. I had never gotten into fights except when someone was beating me up and I had never lifted a hand to anyone. I was not a statistic and I wouldn\\'t let some psychological profile define me. I was done with everything I had to deal with living at home, and my girlfriend at the time gave me an out. \\n She offered to move in together. I was only 17 and she was a little over 18 and at first I thought it was just a pipe dream. After a while though it started making sense. I had a good job and she had a car and we were both aching for our own life. I still don\\'t know how, but when we pitched the idea to our parents they were all in agreement. \\n We moved in together. I was finally free. And for the first time in a long time I felt appreciated, respected, and admired. my girlfriend did what my parents didn\\'t and encouraged me and drove me to do what I wanted to do, and was always proud of everything I accomplished. Things were and are hard, but we\\'re making it and I feel so much better than I ever did, just knowing that I have someone who will always be there to support and love me and who will actually say the words \"I\\'m proud of you.\" It is amazing how much of an impact those words really have. I\\'ve just recently graduated and am (hopefully) on the verge of landing just about my dream job, and I owe so much of it to her for being there for me. \\n What amazed me is that I didn\\'t even realize how little my parents showed their admiration for anything I did until just recently, at my graduation. My dad told me congratulations, but never once said he was proud or happy for me. My stepmom took a photo, didn\\'t say a word, and left. I\\'m on much better terms with them now than when I moved out, but it still stings to think about it and how long it has been that way. I\\'m just happy I don\\'t have to deal with it alone anymore. \\n So... if you want to take something from this, then here. Tell your kids, your friends, your SOs, and even your parents that you are proud of them when you are. Notice the things they do and what they achieve. Just because someone else has done it before doesn\\'t make it any less of an accomplishment and they need to know that. They won\\'t unless you take the time to tell them. It sounds so simple, but it means so much. I am proud of who you are and what you have done. I am proud of where you are going, and I can\\'t wait to see what you do out there. Give them hell, and never stop trying. I know you can do what you set out to do because I know you and who you are. When you get knocked down it will hurt, but you\\'re going to get back up and you will keep going because I\\'m rooting for you. I am proud of you.']": "Based on the user's reddit posting history, the user is interested in video games, specifically role-playing games (D&D, Borderlands), board games (Talisman), and Steam games.

I did appreciate the nod to the Smallville finale when the new \"James\" Olsen stated that \"funny, that\\'s how he started.

It was the \"woods\" of our subdivision. \\n Anyways, we called this spot the \"nifty spot\"... we used it to camp, drink, spoke pot, hangout, skip school, et cetera. We also had a fire pit. One morning, when waiting for the bus (the bus passed a cross street near the spot before getting to our stop, which was just a short trail through the woods) we forgot to put out the fire. It burned the majority of the lot, which was right near a bunch of houses. I wasn\\'t actually there, so I guess it wasn\\'t really  me , but it was my group of friends so I hold myself partially accountable. \\n A couple of my friends that went to school that day came back home to fire trucks. \\n We made a Nifty Spot II, eventually a Thrifty spot. We even got the local neighborhood watch to leave a police card on our stolen bench that said \"We are watching you\" from a Lt. (insert his name).', \"He did it for the (insert gasp) prestige of it all. There is no point to any game, and thusly nothing about any game matters. It's purely entertainment (counter argument is that entertainment is the point), sometimes just knowing you did it is the best gift of all. Like climbing Everest, except in a video game with no sun, sore fingers, broken controllers, x number of rage quits, pizza rolls, and a pissed girlfriend (or no girlfriend).\", \"Squadmode is not competitive \\n I know. I never mentioned or indicated that I was talking about squadmode at all. \\n I was just answering your question, so I hope you didn't take offense because it seems you got riled and defensive. I could be wrong. Anyway they are planning to incorporate MLG official rules in to CvC (or so they say), and they intended it to be more competitive. Since most gaming circuits run on 4v4 it made the most sense to run similar group size. \\n > If it was competitive, the larger clan who just happens to play more would not control all if the nodes \\n Now you're talking about clan wars, which is not CvC at all. I didn't address clan wars in the slightest. Different ballgame. Again, I was addressing one line in your comment, answering a question with good intentions (whether the question was rhetorical or not) \\n >this is nothing more than a different way to pub. \\n Well duh. It's clearly not MLG/GB, it's an in-game feature to bring the PUB players closer to competitive gaming, not meant to redefine life as we know it. \\n \\n You clearly have other worries than just what I addressed, as you've divested from my reply with no prompt. \\n So, to address some other issues: \\n \\n Clan War: Is it perfectly balanced? No, but clans are pit against similar sized clans, so a larger clan size shouldn't matter if your clan is decent and active. Now having inactive players is a clan issue, not a clan war issue. If clan A has 70 members that are all active, and your clan has 60 with 30 that's not...well that's not clan wars' fault.  Find better members or a more active clan. If they play more, they've worked at it more. They still HAD to get the wins. We lost to a clan we felt is way worse statistically, and you know what? Our Fault. WE didn't play a lot. We suffered. We dealt with it, it sucks, but we cant all win or it'd be called Call of Duty: You win even when you lose.  IW cares about people playing, not that you have a 5 kd for the clan.  MLG/GB cares about that. Different function, friend, seems like you expected something from someone who isn't and never claimed to be what you wanted. Sorry. It's Cod. happens every year. \\n \\n CvC is meant to be akin to competitive gaming, but not supposed to emulate it. They wanted to add MLG rules and probably will once MLG settles on set rules (I think they have). CvC is classic 4v4 style gaming because that's what competitive gaming does. \\n \\n Squadmodes: I hate squads so fuck it I dont have a response. Of course its not competitive gaming, it's more like Combat Training. Wut? \\n \\n >Just because its 4 players doesn't mean competitive \\n \\n I agree, but it's closer than...say 6v6 in regular TDM lobby? But technically, any game mode is a competition, so it can be called competitive (though poor at that), but you do get a different group of try hard pubscrubs in CvC. It's like visiting China Town in NYC.

I highly recommend the video linked below.  It\\'s not quite the same problem/solution, but a very similar thought process. \\n > what are the communities thoughts on how to retain the feeling of being in a huge, living world, while still having a project that is realistic? \\n Don\\'t.  Seriously.  Like most other things in game dev it\\'s more about giving the  impression  of that kind of world.  The web series extra credits likes to talk about choice and how many games and mechanics only serve to create the illusion of choice or meaningful interaction.  If you break it down from that perspective most games, including AAA titles, do not accomplish much in this field. \\n For example, a lot of people nostalgically remember the Final Fantasy series for their big sprawling worlds and massive (usually 30-50+ hour) adventures.  If you dig into some of the content what you\\'ll see are a ton of fluff npc\\'s and dialogue, a mostly linear progression, and a handful of optional objectives.  The \"world map\" has been a major point pride for series veterans, but if you examine them closely they only give the impression of exploration.  Most of the time objectives are quartered off in sections serving as a set of linear paths making the big the overworld no different than a set of corridors and a teleport system. \\n Another example would be metroidvania styled games, particularly Castlevania: Aria & Dawn of Sorrow, Order of Ecclesia, and Dust: An Elysian Tail.  Most games in the genre are solitary affairs, however these titles added a small village hub with NPC\\'s.  Beyond the flavor text these NPC\\'s often split up the roles that were handled by singular entities (The Librarian & Maria in Symphony of the Night, the computer in Metroid Fusion).  In reality the marginal cost of adding a handful of NPC\\'s will always be small compared the cost of creating the underlying systems for the first one.  By splitting a single peddler into an item, armor, and weapons vendor the player gains the impression of life for what is essentially good OOP and a palette swapped sprite. \\n Roguelikes tend to feel like individual experiences with no relationship between runs.  There\\'s no real sense of a \"huge, living world\" when it\\'s essentially random rooms with the same enemies and tiles.  Rogue Legacy greatly alleviated this issue with the lineage system.  By having each play attempt provide rewards to improve the family and subsequent quests they managed to unify the runs into a single epic quest to beat the boss.  Yes, it was a core game mechanic, but alongside of a few lines of story text (seriously, it\\'s probably less than 100 lines overall) this simple mechanic completely changed how the player perceived the game.  Oh, and by the way, it was originally meant to be a sprawling and overambitious Castlevania styled game.  In fact, most of their decisions were made to address realistic budgeting for the title.

I'm not a techie, but to stream raw video output locally would still require a ton of bandwidth most routers and ethernet(?) couldn't support, right?  So being able to stream would mean that computer running the game would also be encoding a video feed to other devices.  If this were the case, wouldn't the encode also be internet worthy? \\n If I understand this right, Steam could actually become a platform for video capture, sharing, and livestream which makes the multimedia (Music, TV, Movies) seem less out of place.\", 'Since we seem to have a broad group of people here I was kind of curious to see what kinds of things everyone is into.

In terms of elements a solid art style and fun soundtrack will draw me in, so I ended up with a strong preference for East Asian/Japanese games (Although Bioshock and Deus Ex get a special western mention). \\n \\n Some of the series I\\'m into are pretty huge and well known own, such as Castlevania, Final Fantasy, and [Touhou](  While those are still quite valuable to me, I now find a lot more attraction to some of the niche titles like [Valkyria Chronicles](  I absolutely adore how they put up the whole thing to feel like a storybook.  There are tons of juicy bits like the sound effects coming out like comic text or the subtle hatching in the shadows through the gameplay and cutscenes.  The music is moody and adjusts well to the shifts in the battles and war throughout the game. \\n \\n Another set of titles that really stuck with me was  Dark Cloud 2  and used perfectly in each cutscene or environment.

I dont smoke anymore, not even occasionally because i cannot handle it. I think weed is a stupid waste of money. I dont like being around people when theyre doing it. \\n However, tobacco is much more addictive and harder to quit than marijuana by far, and tobacco smoking has been linked to far higher chance of disease. People smoke more tobacco than marijuana. A cigarette has about a gram of smoking material in it, and ive known people who smoke two packs a day. The most ive seen anyone smoke weed was a gram a day, which is very uncommon. Quitting my cigarette habit was way harder than quitting my weed habit. Tobacco is way worse than weed. Prove me wrong. \\n Alcohol is the worst drug we are talking about here. Alcohol withdrawal can put you into siezures and kill you while marijuana withdrawal causes insomnia and headaches, and an urge to smoke which for me after daily usage for three years went away after a week. Alcohol makes some people transform into monsters and come home to beat their wives and children. This happened to many of my freinds growing up. Never heard anyone talk about a father coming home after smoking too much weed and beating the fuck out of their kids. \\n Drinking 25 shots of booze will kill you. Eating seven cigarettes or an entire cigar at once would in theory kill you. You cant overdose on marijuana.

I\\'ve never felt addicted to booze, pills, tobacco, etc like i\\'ve been with weed. It\\'s not that simple bro. \\n What I\\'m saying is not that out there, I\\'ve smoked weed for five years and have seen this firsthand with many people. It\\'s not a matter of willpower to cut down. An addiction is an addiction. It\\'s either smoking a gram a day or not at all for me, so I picked the latter after years of trying.  I felt withdrawals... Sure they are mild, but both me and my dad got physically sick when we abruptly stopped smoking weed.

My peak experience with acid was as follows: \\n Took three hits and longboarded to Temple Square. I was raised mormon but left at 15. It was strange. I got to go up to the temple and put my hand on it it, thinking \"the people who made this probably didn\\'t like the native americans much\", and then I saw a LDS general authority jogging around it with his younger, attractive girlfriend. I thought this was absolutely rediculous, him having religious authority, anyone having religious authority. \\n I had my fill of the \"Church Zone\" and went to the \"State Zone\"... As in the Utah State Capitol building. I just thought the idea of a church or a government was absolutely rediculous at this point. These buildings were made by people who by today\\'s standards would be seen as crazy intolerant zealots. \\n Then I went to Memory Grove Park(there was an acid trip scene filmed here in SLC Punk! by the way) and went on a trail. I sat down and tried to break apart how a tree worked by looking at it. I figured that there was a fractal node system of some sort going on. Then I realized I am like a leaf. And this was in fall so a lot of leaves had fallen off and were aging. The old leaves were wrinkled just like old people. And they fall off and become the dirt in the ground. \\n So I saw this as a big metaphor for life. Somewhere in my head I accepted that death is a process that is okay, and part of a bigger picture.

In my Boy Scout troop, we were always notorious for pranking our summer camp on one of the last nights of the week, every summer. It was sort of a rite of passage for the older scouts (15 and up, usually) in my troop and it was a big deal to us. \\n Anyways, my last summer before I got Eagle and aged out, I had an idea. We\\'d been brainstorming what to do and it just sort of came to me. The dining hall was furnished with a bunch (read: ~350) of these plastic chairs, mostly the same size and style for ease of stacking. What we did was take every single one of these chairs and, using a ladder that was conveniently attached to the wall of the building, the nine or ten of us that were participating basically set up a relay and put every single one of those chairs on the roof of the dining hall. We also put the lifeguard stand in the swimming pool and spelled out \"???\" on a pavilion roof with paddles and life jackets. The entire operation only took about an hour and a half or so but I\\'m amazed we didn\\'t get caught. \\n Our scoutmaster finds out and immediately knew that it was us, even though we try to deny it. Doesn\\'t work, he makes us get up and we go down to see the camp directors, who are livid. It turns out we had stacked all the chairs on the roof of a very expensive walk-in refrigeration unit, and they were worried about it collapsing. Meh, whatevs. We line up for the morning flag ceremony and it\\'s all anyone could talk about, camp-wide. \\n The best part, in my opinion, of the whole operation was one of the unseen effects of removing all the chairs from the dining hall: we had to eat breakfast standing up. After breakfast we clean the dining hall, bring all the chairs down, and just generally undo our damage. After lunch we had to clean the dining hall again. After dinner we had to clean the dining hall again. Thankfully there were 9-10 of us so it really didn\\'t take all that long and it was totally worth it. \\n That night at the closing flag ceremony those of us who participated wore the camp t-shirts rather than our traditional uniforms so that we could stand out. I mean, we were pretty proud of what we\\'d done, and we wanted recognition. The camp wanted to play it down so I think they gave us an honorary award, like \"best prank\" or something. \\n There\\'s more I could add, but this is already a wall of text.', 'It was revealed a while back that in TWOW Sansa is going to do some sort of morally objectionable act that might not sit well with the fans. Not sure how much this has been talked about on here, but an idea came to me today. \\n I\\'m doing my reread of A Storm of Swords and, while I\\'m not there yet, I\\'m constantly aware while reading Catelyn\\'s chapters that the Red Wedding is fast approaching. In the books, as far as I can remember, following the wedding the Blackfish and Jeyne Westerling disappear. We don\\'t know where they are, but we can reasonably assume they get away and are in hiding. \\n On top of this I was comparing how that scene played out on the show. I understand the show isn\\'t canon, but it stands to reason that if Robb\\'s wife on the show was killed off then she is likely to die in the books as well. Again, not canon, all speculation, etc., I get it. Just hypothesizing. \\n Anyway, enter Sansa. She\\'s coming down from the Eyrie for the winter to the Vale of Arryn, and who does she find there but her dear great-uncle and sister-in-law, growing heavy with child. We as readers have sort of picked up on the idea that Sansa is learning to play \"the game\" and is learning from one of the best in Littlefinger. \\n Now we get to my idea. Sansa is going to recognize that, with her brother dead, the unborn child is the heir to the North. However, Sansa is soon to be lady regent of the Vale if Littlefinger\\'s plan works out, plus she has a (somewhat distant) claim to Riverrun. My thinking is that maybe Sansa will dispose of Jeyne in some way or another, thus solidifying her claim to three realms. \\n Kind of tin-foily, and certainly not supported by the books, but it stands to reason that if Jeyne wasn\\'t dead or going to be killed at some point then they wouldn\\'t have killed her on the show. \\n Of course, you could also assume that if they knew she would be killed by Sansa then they probably would have spared her for that. \\n I don\\'t know, it was just a thought I had and it seemed like a fun idea to entertain so I wanted to share it with you. Thoughts?', 'Well first off, it\\'s the \"Desolation\" of Smaug, which is a reference to the area around the Lonely Mountain that Smaug burned down and cleared out after capturing the mountain. The movie will involve the post-Misty Mountains portion of the journey, including the trip through Mirkwood, the stay in the Elven Halls and subsequent escape, and the visit to Esgaroth, possibly leading to Bilbo\\'s encounters with Smaug if there\\'s time. I would be surprised if they fit the actual battle with Smaug into that movie, considering at the same time they\\'ll be telling of what Gandalf had been doing regarding the Necromancer (Sauron) at Dol Guldur while the rest of the company was in Mirkwood. If that\\'s the case then the last movie will involve the fight with Smaug (and possibly their first encounters with him as well), the recapture of the Lonely Mountain, the standoff between Thorin and the the Dwarves and the contingent of elves and men at their door, the Battle of Five Armies, the return journey, and whatever else from the outside works they\\'ve been consulting that they might decide to throw in.', \"Sorry for the wall of text, but here goes! \\n I'm still somewhat in the formative stages of my worldbuilding. I'm ultimately hoping to turn all this into a novel, so I'm juggling plot and setting so that slows things down a bit. \\n Anyway, my era is primarily medieval but with some touches of pre-industrial technology here and there, mostly in the form of machinery. I guess a parallel could be made to the Dwemmer ruins in the Elder Scrolls games. \\n The political aspects are taking me longer to work out than most other parts of the story. One of my main inspirations is the political revolutions occurring in the Germanic states in the 1800s. Bismarck was a very interesting political figure and the way he dealt with opposing forces in the newly-unified German state was impressive. I really like German culture and the diversity in the Germanic states is interesting to me, considering that prior to 1815 there were more than 300 sovereign states spread across present-day Germany, Poland, Austria, France, Switzerland, Italy, Czech Republic, etc., and that they were mainly just linked by a common language and cultural tradition. I wanted to take this sort of diversity, minimize it for ease of reading and writing, and make a story out of it. \\n So with that in mind, the political system I'm working on will be a similar to a constitutional monarchy, though the sovereign will retain a lot of his or her powers. The parliament/senate/assembly will be bicameral- the upper house will be made up of the elected and/or hereditary leaders of each province, plus certain advisors and leaders appointed by the monarch. The lower house will be made up of smaller lords and nobles and lesser elected officials. The upper house will deal with issues pertaining to foreign affairs, inter-provincial and -national commerce, and large-scale governance, while the lower house will deal with taxation, roads, and just general municipal affairs. Basically, high politics versus low politics. \\n The trick here is to create characters that fit into the system and will know how to manipulate it and create intrigue. The story will sort of jump into a period where there are pressures for unification from some factions, while others want to maintain their historical autonomy. Internal struggles, mixed with pressures from competing nations/kingdoms, my equivalents to France, Britain, Russia, etc., and some other things I've thrown in on my own, should hopefully make for an interesting story.\", \"I am still a fan, but at times I feel like I'm just watching it because I've invested so much time in it that I need to see it through. There are a few characters who I still like a lot, such as Eric and Lafayette, that keep me interested, and I liked the insights into vampire society and politics that we've been getting these last several seasons (leading up to finally meeting the Authority). However, I think Sookie is kind of an idiot and I haven't really liked her all that much since the first season. Maybe it's not that she's dumb but that I just can't connect with her or something, but I'm not a huge fan. I also think the stuff with Bill has gotten steadily weirder the further the show goes. At first he was just a Civil War veteran-turned-vampire who fell for a human that could read minds, and now he's the King of Louisiana and a prophet/holy vessel/Messiah for Lilith.

Very safe, little to no crime, everyone knows everyone. \\n One day I had my hair in two, two strand twist/braids(I\\'m white, think Dorothy from Wizard of Oz)and I went into the local hardware store. One lady there, lives about a block from me, said she wished she could do that for her daughter because she doesn\\'t know how to do her hair. The woman is white, kid is black, adopted obviously. I tell her I actually know how how to do black hair, used to do it for a living, gave her a couple YouTube channels to look into, said if she had any problems, I\\'m right down the street. \\n So one day, the girl, we\\'ll call her Jane(she\\'s 16 btw), rings my doorbell and asks if I would do her hair for a party. Sure, come on in. I don\\'t know how many of you know, but it takes quite a long time for black hair to be done. So we put on a movie, and she starts in talking like a 16 year old girl does lol. \\n Now, I knew through the grapevine that Jane was having a tough time in our town. For one, she\\'s black in a primarily white and Mexican small town. What other black people there are, unfortunately, are the type that racists say prove them right. You can count the number of upstanding black citizens on one hand, the rest are welfare/drugs/poverty/what have you. I won\\'t get into the why\\'s and how\\'s of it, but that\\'s just the stone cold reality here. Very sad. \\n On top of being black, Jane is adopted, to white parents. And has 3 also adopted siblings, but they are all Mexican or Mexican/white, which is more accepted here. On top of that, she has some issues. The kid has seen some shit in her short life, more than most adults. This has hurt her mentally and physically, lots of scars in both areas. She\\'s in and out of the hospital/treatment centers for cutting, suicidal thoughts, extreme depression, burning, and various other things. You can\\'t even imagine the shit this kid gets in a town like this, even from adults. One of the churches set up an intervention because they wanted to exorcise her! \\n So she jabbers like a teenager, and I listen and do her hair. She talks about boys and drama, the way she\\'s treated at school, what she\\'s into, her siblings\\' problems, her parents\\' problems, just general off loading of the things on her mind. I listen, toss in a few, \"Don\\'t worry about what other people say, be yourself\\'s\" and off she bounces back home. \\n Next week she comes bouncing back with hair questions, and while I\\'m teaching her she finds out I can crochet and sew. So the next day she shows up with yarn and a crochet hook wanting to learn. And then it became a habit. \\n The kid is head over heels in hero worship for me. She has so many questions and thinks I have all the answers. She asks my SO about things as well(he generally hides in his man cave when she\\'s here). I get it. In her house there\\'s 4 teenagers with issues, vying for the attention of two parents that are realizing that they got a bit in over their heads with them. They adopted them as 7 and 8 year olds, don\\'t think they put much thought into what 4 teenagers at once would be like. But when Jane is at my house, she\\'s an \"only child\". She can talk to me one-on-one without worrying about upsetting someone else. And I think every teenager needs a non-judgmental adult that\\'s not their parents to talk to. Most of us grow up with an aunt or uncle, grandparents, friends\\' cool mom, whatever. She doesn\\'t have that, so she has me. \\n And I don\\'t mind her, she\\'s a good kid. At 30, I\\'m far too old to be her BFF, but, as my friend put it, I\\'m like the one person Big Brother/Big Sister program for our county. She brings supplies and we\\'ll sew or crochet, I let her dig through my sewing room and be creative, or we\\'ll watch a movie, or she does my nails, she sometimes stays for dinner so I\\'m teaching her how to cook. She\\'s in the marching band at school, so I went to homecoming to cheer for her. She plays with my dogs, she walks them with me. I teach her how to do her hair. Couple times a week it\\'s like I adopted a teenager, she calls me sissy. \\n I was fine with all this until recently. One morning last month, I wake up and she\\'s standing in my bedroom. She was going to a band contest and wanted to borrow a makeup bag and some makeup. Sometimes I\\'m hard to find in my own house, and I don\\'t always hear the doorbell. The back door was unlocked, so she thought I was up and just didn\\'t hear, so she came looking for me. Well, I was dead out asleep and she scared the fuck out of me. We had a long discussion about it, she felt terrible, and it was an innocent mistake, but I told her if I don\\'t answer the door, she needs to text me. If I don\\'t answer the text, I\\'m either asleep or busy. And she usually texts me before coming over anyway. \"No, I don\\'t hate you forever, just use your head in the future please.\" \\n Yesterday it happened again. I woke up and my SO asked me if Jane had text me. I said no and he said, \"Well she was in the fucking house again and I\\'m pretty upset\". He said he heard the dogs barking around 9am(he had gotten up to let them out, then went back to bed to watch tv, and nodded off again), it woke him up a bit, then he heard the back door. Next thing he knows, Jane shuffled down the hall, past our bedroom, didn\\'t go into any of the other rooms(one of which is the sewing room), turned around at the end of the hall, and walked back out of the house. \\n So I text Jane and ask her if she was in my house again, and she denies it. Says she went to work at 6am. I know where she works, a little cafe, they don\\'t open at 6 on Sundays. But I want to give her the benefit of doubt, so I ask my SO if he\\'s positive it was her. He says he\\'s 90% sure. So I grill her in text and she swears it wasn\\'t her. I tell her that means a complete stranger just walked into my house(completely unheard of here)and I\\'m scared. I tell her I\\'m going to ask her mom, she still denies it. I finally tell her I\\'m going to check the cameras(that I don\\'t actually have, but she doesn\\'t know that)and after a 10 minute pause, she fesses up. It was her. \\n She says that she had another \"episode\" so mom put her on her heavy duty meds, so she doesn\\'t remember anything. Mom told her she said she was coming to my house at around 9, that she came and went right back, and that she didn\\'t get to work until 10. I get that this kid is on some strong stuff, I can completely believe that it would zombify her, but I can\\'t have her coming in my house at all hours! \\n So I\\'m not sure what to do at this point, and we\\'ve finally arrived at why I\\'m posting. What am I supposed to do? How do I handle this? Do I talk to her mom and tell her to make sure she has expressed permission to come over before she lets her leave? Do I need to start distancing myself from this kid who\\'s obsession and hero worship might be heading towards unhealthy levels? All doors are locked at all times now, that\\'s for sure, but she\\'s been known to hang out on my back porch even when I\\'m not home because she has nowhere else to go when things get hairy at home(sometimes having nothing to do with her, but like parents are in battle with one of her siblings).

I want to know what they're about, what their goals are, and who the major players will be.  I make sure I include some sort of central (and possibly hidden) conflict(s) that will be a good lead in for the campaign.  Then I think in terms of how each of the factions will plan to achieve their goals, and what happens if the PCs don't interfere with their plans.  This is a pretty sandbox style setup, but with story elements thrown into the mix. \\n At this point, I pause to get player input in terms of what sorts of characters they will play.  I make sure each player announces some hooks for their PC, which gives me an idea of what sort of game they want to play, and how to entice their PC into adventures.  (The system I use helps reward players for this)  This then gives me ideas of how to expose the various factions' plans to the PCs in ways that they'll naturally get involved.  The adventure then, is a plan from the antagonists' perspective, and the PCs are invited to interfere with it (or not) as they see fit.  However, there are strong story elements that drive the PCs to action, whatever those actions may be.  Sometimes they'll end up doing something unpredictable, and I make sure that whatever they are doing, the world moves forward.\", 'I\\'ve had a lot more success using a Wiki for my own project, although I was also creating a new ruleset (Fate modification) to go with the setting.

They are there to enforce laws and to maintain the peace, and in many (not all) places, are issued with lethal weapons with which they can  defend  themselves.  They are there to stop the bad guys.  But the expectation is that they are there to arrest the criminals and bring them in for trial, not take them out with a sniper round or blow them up with a grenade. \\n And you are right that history is rife with examples of military and police forces overstepping their bounds.

We had a brief discussion about a similar topic of character survival with our gaming group the other day.  What came up was that there were two schools of thought on how players relate to their characters. \\n Some players felt their characters were their  avatars  into the world; it was the means by which players exercised their control, and the characters represented / were proxies for the players in some way.  Here survival was paramount.  If you let your character die, you\\'ve failed somehow. \\n Other players felt their characters were  props or actors  on a stage set by the game.  There is a story unfolding, and you participated in / controlled it through your characters.  And in fact, there may be ways to directly control the story in ways outside that have nothing to do with your characters.  The contrast was that for these players, character survival wasn\\'t as important a concern.  If the characters died in a way that befit their personalities, then mission accomplished. \\n It seems the divide maps pretty nicely on first and third person PoV.  Fate certainly promotes the \"characters as actors\" concept by allowing you narrative control over things outside your character.  By contrast, games like Shadowrun are very objective focused and it may be easier to think of them as the run for the  players  to beat.

The answer wasn\\'t meant to confuse you, but tell you a little bit about pro audio equipment vs hi-fi, vs rigging up a jankety cable to do something it is not designed to do. \\n Here\\'s the deal: You say it\\'s a \"box speaker\", but where are the controls for volume and audio inputs and outputs (ie, the preamp for pro audio, or the receiver for hi-fi)? What all inputs are on there? Are there any stereo/RCA type inputs or only XLR? \\n The cord shown in your reply here (and from another poster) should work if that is the only means of signal path. What I was trying to point out is that you are taking a L/R/ground input (stereo plug if not used on a balanced TRS connector - the one I described with ground/mono/mono phase shift), and then splitting it into a cable that we have no idea how it is wired (but guaranteed either 1 pin is floating or could possibly hurt you if is duplicated signal, and you are plugging it into a balanced connector, which will then halve or null your volume, since it subtracts it from itself). \\n The fact that your cord now works, and this is the same cord does not guarantee they are wired the same way. Most cords that make sense do not use a floating pin, or have more outputs than inputs. For all you know, that cord pictured could be a stereo jack to multiple stereo XLR splitter, and not even be wired for L/R. \\n The cord pictured  will  connect. However, I hope they are wired the same way, since this is not a  standard  cable, and you have no way of knowing what that third pin in each XLR is connected to. \\n If you can, link a model number for your \"box speaker\".', \"The driver that operates the Icicle does not allow for multiple devices to be used as ASIO inputs, unless you do some manhandling with ASIO4ALL, or some other workaround. \\n If you already have multiple mics, I don't see how your math regarding buying multiple Icicles ($35 at cheapest) adds up. The cheapest 2 channel interface on Musicians' Friend is like $49. An 8 channel amazing preamp is around $250. \\n How many mics do you have, and are planning to use at once for drums?\", \"I had bought a used Ibanez 7 string off a friend, and though it was taken care of immaculately, the guitar just sounded awful compared to my other gear. The amount of noise generated almost exceeded any note definition. By this, I don't mean hum or any electrical issues. All chords just had mush added on top of them. The stock Ibanez pickups were just noisy as fuck. \\n I bought a set of Seymour Duncan SH-6 Super Distortion 7 string pickups, and I figured that they would be at least slightly better, if not way better. I expected about 10 minutes of soldering (since I have outfitted all my gear with random new pickups). \\n I was NOT prepared for the fact that Ibanez shitty screws the pickups straight into the body with no springs (they used two arbitrary pieces of foam stuck to the underside of the pickups. This sort of explained why I was never able to raise the stock pickups past a point where the screw would be slack, and the pickups still too low. The metal covered pickups I bought absolutely didn't fit the crappy stock routing, and a little bit of dremel work did the trick. \\n I can't rave about how much better these pickups sound over the stock pickups.

I use a combination of streaming services, sites and torrents as well as music stored on my computer. \\n My laptop is getting really creaky and the 800gb or so of space is almost full up, so what I'd like to do is move my media somewhere it has roome to grow, as well as reinstall windows. \\n B: why not NAS (please correct if wrong) \\n I originally thought I'd spring for a Chromecast and Synology NAS with 2-4TB in RAID and use its native OS / media apps to control it from my phone, but realised: \\n \\n Streaming video to my chromecast is horrendously jerky over my home connection \\n I'd have to rewire my house (currently wifi router is in hallway, gets kicked over occasionally and as I'd need to connect NAS to the router by LAN cable I didn't want to risk the NAS getting damaged) \\n I'd have to spring for an expensive NAS box (I was looking at Synology) for it to be able to reliable encode HD video \\n I wouldn't use some of the features of the NAS (no desire to access my media outside of my home network, no need to host any other software or data) \\n It would be better to just have a computer connected directly via HDMI to the projector and have audio jacked in directly (though I could conceivably set up a bluetooth receiver similar to the ones made by [Belkin]( \\n \\n C: what I need to be able to do at the lowest price (in the UK) \\n So this points me to a small HTPC. As I haven't looked at specs for a while, I'm at a bit of a loss of how powerful a machine I need to: \\n \\n Run a torrent client \\n Accept 2-4TB of storage, either internally (preferably RAID) or externally, as media will be indexed for rapid searching and will only need to be accessed 1 file at a  time \\n Stream web-based content either in browser or with a dedicated app \\n Run something like Kodi to organise and play back stored media \\n Allow remote access over a home network (or maybe just standard sharing) \\n Allow me to view audio files through an android phone, but play on the HTPC (which would be hooked up to speakers, I think this is a KOBI features)  this is because I don't have a monitor for browsing the computer due to my main non-laptop screen being a projector, so I want to be able to access and playback audio without having to turn on the projector. \\n \\n I keep finding HTPCs that either cost  500+ pounds  or [cheap ones]( which I could just hook up some external storage to that I'm worried would be underpowered.\", \"Ish... pullups respond well to overall volume, but the relationship between how many you can do over a day versus how that brings up the maximum you can cluster into a set varies from person-to-person. \\n An extreme case of this is doing a set of pullups to near failure every hour (e.g. if you work at home or are a student with enough off days). Because this can lead you to doing >100 PUs per day (i.e. more than you'd do in a typical training session), this will ramp up your capacity as well as drive decent muscle growth, due to sheer volume. c/f Pavel Tsatsouline on this. \\n However what you're doing describes something closer to the myo reps methodology (search this sub), putting that all into a shorter space of time. However, like /u/Strikerrjones says, you're gonna have to do more than one rep per burst to get the most out of it. \\n Finally, rest-pause training has shown to be effective (find the studies or trust me as an anecdote), but that's still slightly different to what you're suggesting here.\", \"I look back upon my logs and ask: could it really have been four long years since I started lifting? \\n Yea, the path to swoledom is long and the road behind me was fraught with pits and falls and long, long pauses. \\n There was much stupidity along the way, I blame my own young gullibility and foolishness: \\n \\n Bro-splits \\n \\n Anorexia \\n \\n Not squatting \\n \\n Flared elbows on the bench \\n \\n Externally rotated shoulders on the dip \\n \\n Avoiding shrugs and curls thinking they were vanity movements and thereby suffering strength losses \\n \\n Accordian deadlifts \\n \\n \\n The list goes on and on. And yet, through various training injuries, plus a left elbow that no longer fully extends and a weakened right shoulder from rugby ( Bully for you, OP, playing the gentleman's game! ), I feel that I've made progress down this road. \\n I have been whalemode, ghandimode, t-rexmode and now approach dragonmode. I have broken through the various strength thresholds and let me say to our younger brethren:  there is no finer feeling of accomplishment in the weight-room than loading multiple times yourself in iron onto the bar, then putting it on your back or in your hands and watching that steel flex while your flesh is unyielding and diamantine . \\n My friend asked me, when I'd come back from my first ever deadlift, what I was going to do when I could lift my bodyweight. I knew at that moment that the road I walked I would follow for life. Because somewhere past that 1x pull, there's a 2x. And a 3x.

Started the 12-week version you find in some [spreadsheets]( and plugged in a conservative max. Now I be like 2.7x. \\n Thoughts: the 4x4 is daunting at the beginning, the jumps for the two heavy doubles are intimidating, the back off 8+ set is really scary until you complete the 2 sets of heavy doubles. If you start low enough and give your body time to adjust to the (probable) hike in volume compared to what you're used to, it is a really rewarding program. \\n It combines what I really enjoy: heavy ass deadlifts and volume at a weight (4x4+8 at c.75% of max) that just works with deadlifts.

A foundational tenet of these narratives is that monotheistic Yahwehism is true and factual. \\n The following problems exist with your quest: \\n \\n Pretend that you have access to all the knowledge of everything within the universe (and not just the Gospels) - with this knowledge prove that Yahweh does not exist where the attributes of this Yahweh is that Yahweh exists out of the universe, outside of space-time, and transcends (whatever the fuck that means) everything. \\n The canon Gospels were designed to support the position of Jesus as the Jewish Messiah and John goes even further to raise Jesus to just short of being a Deity (making the human Jesus a full Deity would have been to contrary to the most basic tenets of the Jews from which the Christian-Jewish cult was attempting to recruit members - the whole fully human-fully yahweh was made up later).  Is it reasonable to find supportive fan-fiction that proves the most foundational and essential tenet of the protagonist to be false?  \\n \\n Let's see how this argument goes.... \\n In a goodly number of Gospel narratives, reference is made to the apologetics of Paul (well the 7 books that were probably actually written by Paul/Saul and which were probably written before Mark, the first Gospel) and to the Old Testament/Torah. These references to Yahweh, and Yahweh worship, establishes the precept and precedent that earlier scripture related to Yahweh, and worship of Yahweh, are accepted canon and doctrine (except for minor implementation differences). With this precept and precedent established, I present the: \\n \\n [Argument against monotheistic Yahwehism/Allahism]( \\n \\n of which the\", 'The God of Abraham, the monotheistic belief in Yahweh (aka. God or Allah), is the foundational and essential Deity for Judaism, Christianity and Islam. \\n > They absolutely do not believe in the same god. \\n This statement may be better presented as: They absolutely do not believe in the same [interpretation of the monotheistic] god [construct/concept identified as Yahweh/YHWH/Allah]. \\n The God is the same; however the interpretation and presentation of the assigned attributes of monotheistic Yawhahism differs and each view is subjected to extensive apologetics to justify/rationalize that \"this\" self-serving viewpoint is the correct and superior view. \\n For example, from  Major Differences Between Islam and Christianity  and goes on to argue/claim that the nontrinitarian position is flawed and therefore a weakness in Islam. \\n \"Trinitarianism is Monotheism \\n Trinitarianism is monotheism. The debate between Muslims and Christians is whether the monotheism of the Qur\u2019an is true or whether the monotheism of the Bible is true. Does the Bible or the Qur\u2019an present us with the one true God. \\n Christians believe that the Bible presents us with the one true God and that the Islamic form monotheism is one of its major weaknesses. As one Christian scholar notes: \\n Its [Islam\u2019s] doctrine of God is the major weakness of Islam\u2026Only a God who is triune can be personal. Only the Holy Trinity can be love. Human love cannot possibly reflect the nature of God unless God is a Trinity of persons in union and communion. A solitary monad cannot love and, since it cannot love, neither can it be a person\u2026Trinitarian theology asserts that love is ultimate because God is love, because he is three persons of undivided loving communion (Robert Letham, The Holy Trinity, 446). \" \\n For more on the Trinitarian monotheistic Yahweh construct, you can check out the apologetics of the Roman Catholic Church. \\n From: [Catechism of the Catholic Church: The Profession of Faith, \"I BELIEVE IN GOD THE FATHER ALMIGHTY, CREATOR OF HEAVEN AND EARTH\"]( \\n The dogma of the Holy Trinity \\n 253 The Trinity is One. We do not confess three Gods, but one God in three persons, the \"consubstantial Trinity\".83 The divine persons do not share the one divinity among themselves but each of them is God whole and entire: \"The Father is that which the Son is, the Son that which the Father is, the Father and the Son that which the Holy Spirit is, i.e. by nature one God.\"84 In the words of the Fourth Lateran Council (1215), \"Each of the persons is that supreme reality, viz., the divine substance, essence or nature.\"85 \\n 254 The divine persons are really distinct from one another. \"God is one but not solitary.\"86 \"Father\", \"Son\", \"Holy Spirit\" are not simply names designating modalities of the divine being, for they are really distinct from one another: \"He is not the Father who is the Son, nor is the Son he who is the Father, nor is the Holy Spirit he who is the Father or the Son.\"87 They are distinct from one another in their relations of origin: \"It is the Father who generates, the Son who is begotten, and the Holy Spirit who proceeds.\"88 The divine Unity is Triune. \\n 255 The divine persons are relative to one another. Because it does not divide the divine unity, the real distinction of the persons from one another resides solely in the relationships which relate them to one another: \"In the relational names of the persons the Father is related to the Son, the Son to the Father, and the Holy Spirit to both. While they are called three persons in view of their relations, we believe in one nature or substance.\"89 Indeed \"everything (in them) is one where there is no opposition of relationship.\"90 \"Because of that unity the Father is wholly in the Son and wholly in the Holy Spirit; the Son is wholly in the Father and wholly in the Holy Spirit; the Holy Spirit is wholly in the Father and wholly in the Son.\"91 \\n All three religions (Judaism, Christianity, and Islam) claim monotheistic Yahwehism as their essential and foundational Deity and all three present extensive apologetics to support the claim that their version is the one true and eternally correct Deity. \\n \\n Regardless of the arguments/claims of whether or not Judaism, Christianity and Islam have, and submit in worship to, the same God, or which God construct is more correct or more monotheistic, I would argue that any monotheistic construction/belief in Yahweh/Allah is fallacious. \\n Given the precedent that Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, has demonstrated in accepting revealed scripture of different cultures, societies and authors concerning the God Yahweh, how does a monotheistic Yahwist reject the essential and foundational polytheistic revealed scripture of polytheistic Yahwehism of societies, cultures and authors that preceded the Torah and Old Testament and which formed the basis of the people, society, culture, and religion of the Israelites that is depicted in Judaism, Christianity and Islam? \\n The physical archaeological and linguistic anthropological evidential sources support and/or document the development and growth of monotheistic Yahwehism/Allahism from a historical polytheistic foundation of revealed holy scripture from Babylonian, Ugarit, Canaanite (hypothesis), and early Israelite societies; this scripture related to Yahwehism shows the origin of Yahweh as a subordinate fertility/rain/warrior local desert God in the polytheistic foundation of the El [El Elyon] (the Father God/God Most High) God pantheon - where the God Yahweh evolved, for man-made/man-driven political and military reasons from the foundational polytheistic (many many gods, El is in charge, Yahweh is the son of, and subordinate to, El) belief, into a monolatry for Yahweh (Yahweh is in charge, acknowledgement and worship of other revealed Gods is accepted), to monotheistic Yahwehism (where Yahweh is and, somehow, always been the one and only God \u201cThere is no God but Allah\u201d/\u201cYou shall have no other gods before Me\").

To a lessor extent (as it is based upon already redacted material and with better editing/explicit rationalizations already included) the New Testament and Qur\\'an also show linkages to this foundational polytheistic belief. Given that monotheistic Yahwehism is the essential foundation of the Abrahamic Religions, this falsehood propagates to any/all doctrine/dogma/claims based upon this foundation - rendering these religions, at best, demonstratively invalid; and nominally, morally and culturally reprehensible. \\n With this false foundation or premise, any claims or doctrine based upon this claim is also false, a lie. In terms of morality, being false, or presenting a lie as truth, is assigned a negative morality; from this position any and all sources, scripture, apologetics, prophets, messiahs, savors, which are dependent upon the false and negative morality, but essential position of monotheistic Yahwehism, are also fallacious.', 'three highly precise clocks\u2014the heavens, atomic and optical clocks\u2014came about by accident? \\n Seems to be a mixture of two classic arguments for a designer deity.

From this precedent, then the Holy Scriptures related to Allah/Yahweh, scriptures with predate the books of Torah, must also be considered in the study of Allah. \\n Ask the counsellor to share with you the origin story of Allah and the worship of Allah - as the beginning may help you to see the truth of Islam.  The history of Allah/Yahweh, and the history of worship of Allah/Yahweh, that the Prophet Muhammad was undoubtedly aware but chose not to incorporate within the words that would become the Qur\\'an as the Prophet did with predecessor Judaism and Christian Yahwist history. \\n Spoiler: The origins of Allah/Yahweh is polytheistic and the real physical archeological and linguistic anthropological evidence shows an evolution from a polytheistic belief to a henotheistic polytheistic belief (Allah/Yahweh is one of many Gods, and deserves special worship among the pantheon), to a monolatrist polytheistic belief (Allah/Yahweh is the most important God, there exists other Gods but worship of these other Gods is to be rejected) to, finally, a monotheistic belief (there is and, somehow, always has been, only Allah/Yahweh) for strictly man-driven military and political gains and dominance.', 'Can a potential/possible cause of x be logically rejected without determining an alternative cause? \\n Yes, if \"logically rejected\" is not taken as an absolute (100% certainty), and is taken to mean very unlikely (to some level of reliability and confidence).  Why the squirrely definition you ask? Because a \"cause\" (or event/effect/causation/interaction) is a physicalistic or materialistic descriptor and within a physicalistic system, certainty (100% certainty) or unity probabilities are unjustifiable (though values asymptotically approaching certainty/unity are possible). See [Problem of Induction]( There is one notable exception - many theistic systems claim absolute 100% certain knowledge (though with an intervening Deity the Problem of Induction is [actually much worse for the theist]( \\n An alternate cause or hypothesis can be rejected if there is no credible evidence or argument to (1) justify rejection of the null hypothesis and (2) provide support for the alternate hypothesis.  For example: \\n Null hypothesis: {supernatural deities do not exist} \\n The null hypothesis cannot be proven, only rejected (due to falsification or evidence/argument to support an alternate hypothesis). \\n Alternate hypothesis: {supernatural deities do exist and that Deity is the creator Deity} \\n In order to support acceptance of the alternative hypothesis the burden of proof must be met to justify rejection of the null hypothesis and to support the alternate hypothesis presented. In the above example where the alternate hypothesis has two claims (i.e., supernatural deities do exist, supernatural deity(ies) are the source of creation) then two burdens of proof are required. Failure to meet the burden of proof results, logically, in the rejection of the alternate hypothesis - with the null hypothesis remaining. However, just because there is no credible evidence/argument to support the alternate hypothesis, that does not prove, to a level of 100% certainty, that a creator supernatural Deity does not exist (the absence of evidence does not provide a certainty of evidence of absence - see God of Gaps), only that it would be disingenuous to reject the null hypothesis and believe or accept the alternate hypothesis. \\n Another example. There is a claim to a pill that taken daily for a lifetime will prevent cancer. The null hypothesis is {the pill will not prevent cancer} and the alternate hypothesis is {the pill will prevent cancer to some level of reliability and confidence, to some level of efficacy}. If the anti-cancer pill is presented without any credible evidence, is the rejection of the null hypothesis and the acceptance of the alternate hypothesis justified? If you answer yes to this question, I would like to sell you a lifetime supply of anti-cancer pills, with no credible claims (or liability) to efficacy, for a large upfront payment, with additional monthly instalments for the duration of your life :D  In this example it is clear (hopefully) that one will, logically, fail to reject the null hypothesis and not accept the alternate hypothesis, even though another cancer prevention method (another alternate hypothesis) is not presented for consideration.', 'live question and answer show \\n > Islamic group \\n With Islam being both a culture and religion to Muslims, and with the belief that all events/effects/causations/interactions occur only with the direct and purposeful intervention of Allah, plus the belief that prayers to Allah requesting intervention/supplication may actually be answered positively - how can the adherent avoid the reprehensible dismissal and abstention of personal responsibility that so very often accompanies, and is oft demonstrated in, such a belief system by the shifting of responsibility for personal actions (or more often, the lack of action) from the adherent onto Allah? \\n > We will be discussing issues such as does God exist \\n \\n There is no god but God/Allah, and Muhammad is the messenger of God. \\n \\n The most essential and foundational position of Islam is that there is only one god and that God is Allah.

But that is not the topic under discussion. \\n Also note that the DoI is not a legal document - it basically comes down to a bitchfest-against-England document (think of it as saying \"fuck you\" to England, put in proper-eze language) which uses emotions, in addition to actual evidence, as a foundation to gather support for the split from the English masters. \\n Given the DoI author, editors, inputters, the \"Creator\" is a deistic creator Deity that is not believed to have decreed a divine objective morality against which \"rights\" or morals can be determined or derived. The Deistic belief is that there is a positive purpose to creation, and this purpose (while unknown) is the basic for the development of a positive morality (and positive principles, ethics and laws). \\n The question here should be - if there is a Deity that is capable and is actively intervening within the natural physicalistic causality-limited universe in which we inhabit (notwithstanding the presuppositionalist flair), a Deity which is not in evidence other other than wishful thinking, emotions, feelings and circuitous meta/peta-physical arguments with no relationship nor linkage to our reality (which is the definition of Religions Faith), the real question is: \\n Given an intervening Deity and a revealed Divine objective morality, a morality that is unimpeachable, unquestionable, and unchangeable; regardless of what us mere humans, both at the time of revelation and in later societies, consider immoral and reprehensible, how can rights or morals be derived except that which is explicitly stated by the unchangeable Laws decreed by \"God\"?  Implicit rights/morality/Laws require a judgement to be made, and under what authority can a mere human justify speaking for a \"God\"?  Rights/morality/laws which have not been explicitly addressed by the Deity, but are identified as necessary against a non-bronze/iron age society, are worthless under the revealed Divine objective morality - but yet they are followed by true adherents to the Deity.']": "Based on the user's postings, it appears that the user is interested in religious studies, particularly focusing on the Abrahamic religions (Judaism, Christianity, and Islam) and the monotheistic belief in Yahweh/Allah.

First off, there are pre-game decisions to make in Dice Masters, since each player chooses which versions of which heroes to bring to the game, and each player can only buy the heroes they brought to the game.  In Quarriors, on the other hand, it's more like Dominion where there's a randomly determined pool of stuff that all players have access to. \\n Scoring and combat are different.  In Quarriors, you summon creatures, they attack the opponent's creatures but don't take any damage from blockers, and you score points if they survive until the beginning of the next turn.  Dice Masters is, again, more like Magic.  You summon heroes, and they attack your opponent's life total.  The opponent's creatures can be assigned to block, and there's a damage exchange rather than just attackers hitting blockers, so attackers will often be killed by blockers. \\n It also looks like Dice Masters has different types of resources for recruiting different heroes, like the different colors of mana in Magic.  Quarriors just has quiddity, a general resource that gets spent on everything you do. \\n Thematically, Quarriors is more cute/funny/generic fantasy stuff.

If you read it, you will see.

One script, is just information.  She doesn\\'t ask if the child was touched, or if they feel safe.  She DOES talk about what is consider appropriate touching in the family.  For instance, there is an interview on p. 27 of someone, an older child, who was clearly NOT suspected to have been molested.  The investigator didn\\'t do the little anatomical drawing that she did with every single molested child, and didn\\'t ask if the child felt safe, as she did with every single molested child.  Second, there is an enormous amount of information here, recall--this is not the interview of a four-year-old. \\n But the NEXT interview, p. 28-29, the investigator DOES follow the pattern for the for determining if the interviewee is molested or not.

I am very close to the man who was involved and he told me everything he felt when his ex dumped him to go fool around with someone else. \\n \\n When my friend was dumped by his ex (who I also know) so that she could play the field, he was very hurt.  (He was her first kiss, sexual experience, real boyfriend, etc.)  If she had come to him and said, \"Look, I love you, but I need to date around a little before we commit to \"forever\".  Can we take a little break so that I can have some of the same dating experiences you\\'ve already had?\" he would have been sad, but fine.  However, she  broke-up  with him to experience sex with other people (in much the same way  you  did).  That HURT.  It ruined a lot of trust. \\n \\n While they were broken-up for a few months, my friend did start casually seeing someone else.  It wasn\\'t serious, but he did talk about the other girl a little bit.  (Mentioned her on Facebook and posted some pictures of a day-out they had.)  He wasn\\'t trying to show her off, but his ex assumed he was.  She brought her new \"boyfriend\" to his birthday (note: the girl he was seeing WAS NOT there) and showed him off.  She was trying to make my friend feel jealous.  Instead, he saw her as petty and cruel. \\n \\n When things didn\\'t work out between the ex and her fling, she came crawling back to my friend, saying she made a HUGE mistake and wanted to be together forever.  While my friend still had feelings for her, he was apprehensive.  She left him once to go screw other people, threw someone else in his face, and then crawled back when things weren\\'t as easy.  He felt like her back-up.  (That\\'s how she treated him, and that\\'s how you treated your ex.  Playing the field didn\\'t work?

While the average domestic cat is far friendlier than a wild cat, they\\'re still not naturally \"cuddly\" animals. \\n One thing: Don\\'t be an \"alpha\" and force a cat to sit in your lap.  While multi-cat households will have a dominance hierarchy, there\\'s no \"alpha\" and \"beta\" like a wolf or dog pack.  Just \"whoever bitchslaps the hardest.\"  If you force a cat to do anything, they will resent it and avoid the behavior. \\n Your cat is young.  Kittens can take time to become people lovers.  Just chill out and go about your routine.  You may find that your kitten starts spending more time around you when you\\'re just relaxing and ignoring him.  Offer treats during this time to remind him that people are awesome. \\n Many cats never turn into cuddlers.  They\\'re more comfortable just chilling in the same room as you.  While there is nothing wrong with getting another cat or kitten, this is no guarantee that your cats will start being more affectionate.', 'You need to talk to her.

(I was working/going to school long hours and my cat was starting to get very clingy and hyperactive during the time I was home.) \\n As long as there\\'s enough space for each cat to have a \"territory\" and not being completely on top of each other, there should be enough room.  My friends had two cats who hated each other in a very small apartment and everyone survived. \\n I agree that long-term fostering may be a good place to start.  HOWEVER, do not think that just because cats are aggressive in the first weeks they\\'ll never get along.  Make sure that a potential new cat is compatible with your current kitty in activity level, roughness, playfulness, etc.  (Ex: a kitten and a fat, elderly cat may not be a good mix.)

It might be a good idea to stay away from ALL of these relationships and just work on making your way on your own for a little but.

All of them looked-back on their decisions as good, even though it was hard at the time.  Some of them were able to repair relationships years later, while others never were.  However, if your family is more interested in appearances than your happiness or well-being, you may need to step away from them for a while.  Things may get better, they may not.  However, you will be free to make your own decisions and not have to worry about what is \"proper.\" \\n As for the stigma of having two children by two different fathers - Yes, it exists.  However, this is 2011 and not 1950.  It\\'s not what happened in the past, it\\'s what happens in the future.  Do you become the victim of circumstances, or do you take charge and make a way for yourself?  So long as the children are happy, healthy, and cared-for, it doesn\\'t matter if people think bad things.  Those close to you will know they are loved.  Additionally, if you marry someone else who is not their father biologically, that does not prevent him from being their FATHER or their siblings from being brothers or sisters.  Family is not all about blood.  None of my friends who had half-siblings ever called them that.

(Do you want to hear my rant about how hard it has become to get live feeders for baby snakes that NEED live food?  Because I have a rant.)  While their pet rodents may come from feeder stock originally, many stores do not openly sell live feeders.  If they do, they often have separate feeder stock and pet stock (mainly because the pet stock tends to be \"fancy\" and can sell for $15+, while the feeder stock is plainer).  While yes, people may go into a pet store and purchase a \"pet\" rat to feed to a snake, this is not because it\\'s a rat specifically bred to be a feeder animal. \\n All of that being said, I also know people who breed feeder rodents.  If your livelihood is rats, you are very careful NOT to inbreed or otherwise treat your colony in such a way that their genetic viability and production drops.  While feeder breeders may not keep the same type of records that those who breed for show do, this is only because feeder breeders aren\\'t as interested in traits like fur texture or ear size.  A good rodent breeder still keeps close tabs on their colony, and will introduce new blood as needed to ensure the genetic viability of their animals. \\n A lot of feeder breeders will also hold back any particularly nice rats to sell as pets.

I\\'ve met my fair share of dull or unpleasant women and I\\'m sure there are lots fascinating, fun, kind men out there. I\\'m just reflecting on my relationships, sexual or otherwise. \\n I\\'ve always gotten on better with women and femmey people. I\\'m a gal\\'s gal I guess. I\\'ve never had a close male friend and my dating relationships haven\\'t been that intimate (or serious). I feel like I struggle to relate to men and it\\'s really starting to worry me. \\n Women seem to like doing stuff more. And talking about stuff. Over the years I\\'ve had some really fun adventures with women. Hiking, swimming, bike rides, art galleries, punk shows, road trips, shroom trips, laughing till my face hurts, just staring at the stars. \\n I\\'ve found the men I\\'ve dated have mostly wanted to watch tv or play video games or perhaps stare into the bottom of a pint glass. I do like a good/stupid movie but want to talk about it or laugh together. Taking the piss out of a horror movie with a group of friends and some snacks is great. I can\\'t just marathon crime dramas in silence. Video games are fun but I like to just pick it up and play, preferably with others. Not into watching someone \"grind\" endlessly or swear at the tv. I like board games, cards, chess and puzzles, but I have never been able to get guys to play with me. I\\'m not extremely competitive but I do try hard to win obviously. Like a typical girl, I enjoy watching sports and cheering for the home team but I know next to nothing about sports. I once offered to take my then boyfriend to see his most beloved team for his birthday, he declined as he\\'d rather watch it on tv. On the other hand, my girl friends will go to beer league games just for something to do. When ever I put on music, guys jump down my throat that I don\\'t know every album or that I don\\'t \"get\" this style of music. Music is a sensory experience, being an expert on it isn\\'t necessary to enjoy it. I\\'m a shit painter but I\\'ll do art nights with my friend because it\\'s nice to express myself and I get to drink wine. \\n I feel like men don\\'t want to do things they don\\'t see a point to. That\\'s fair. But I feel like doing things together gives you something to talk about. Sharing novel/fun/though-provoking situations is how I bond with people. Guys always want to hang out one on one and I find it hard to keep the conversation going. I also realize my prattling on about people they have never met would be super annoying, but it would be nice if a guy wanted to meet my friends. Even just doing a task together like making dinner seems to make me way more comfortable. \\n I think this is more about the way men are socialized rather than some inherent quality of males. Men seem more afraid to be bad at something, or look silly or admit they don\\'t know everything. On the other hand, I\\'m dismissed as flippant or frivolous because I like to be playful and I do things I\\'m not good at. I have to be good at stuff at work, when I\\'m with someone I just want to goof off. \\n Women seem more open to abstract thoughts and ideas, talking about our pasts and imagining the future. Women can talk about their fears and times they failed without worrying they\\'ll be mocked. I feel like you need to be able to do that to have real intimacy. \\n This is not to bash men, I really really want to get close to a man. I want to meet a guy and fall in love and have him as my best friend and partner in crime. Maybe I\\'m just emotionally immature and this is some elaborate way of avoiding adulthood. Maybe I\\'m a chatter box and totally annoying to men. \\n I also want to add to (already long) post that I am genuinely wondering about my sexuality. I often try to picture what being with a woman romantically might be like. I feel like I have no script for dating women and I don\\'t even know where to start. I\\'ve had very close \"best friends\" where the relationship is almost passionate. Constant declarations of love, being available to each other 24/7, sharing everything, sleeping in the same bed and being physically affectionate. I do feel love and attraction towards women but I don\\'t know how to actually date a woman and not just play girlish games. I\\'m also terrified I\\'d be shit in bed', 'Basically, my boyfriend of 8 months dumped me, drunkenly when I asked him about the fact that he had lost his job (and hid it from me).

I begged him not to end things, and for almost two months I hoped he\\'d change his mind if I just gave him space. I went complete no contact. \\n So against all of the advice I received, I did send him a message. I feel it\\'s helped me accept the break up and begin to move on. I couldn\\'t bear that everything was left hanging. I was waiting for him to be \"emotionally ready\" to talk about the sudden break up. I was stuck in limbo and I\\'m sure he felt bad knowing I was waiting for answers he couldn\\'t give me. \\n I said: \"Hey, I hope you are doing well these days.

Maybe using humor as defense mechanism a bit here. \\n Also, as a kid I was diagnosed with something called dyspracsia. I have poor motor skills but normal intelligence.

But guys are into that, right?\", 'Two months ago, my boyfriend of 8 month dumped me suddenly. He showed up drunk at my house one night and when I asked him about the fact that I had heard from a mutual friend he had been fired from his job, he broke down sobbing hysterically, calling himself a loser and all sorts of names for hiding it from me, saying that had ruined everything between us. He told me that he was seriously depressed and spent most of his days in bed but had been hiding it from me. He told me he was preparing to go out west to scatter his dad\\'s ashes. His father had died driving driving drunk less than two years ago. He only spoke about him a few times and that was just to hint at his anger and hatred of the man. He has also mentioned that his mother had become an angorophobe and that he was the \"man of the house\" now, in charge of looking after his younger brothers and sisters, who he has conflicts with apparently. He was also very ashamed of the fact that he lives at home and works low-paying jobs despite being very educated (lots of student debt). Also, He\\'s Irish-Italian and Catholicism is a big part of his life culturally but he does not believe in god, I was raised without religion but this a big crisis for him, when I asked him about it months ago he wept, saying he misses god. \\n He was a great boyfriend to me, always caring and supportive when I was stressed or anxious. He very open to listening to my problems but was very tight-lipped when it came to his own. I guess our relationship dynamic was that he was the strong one, he called me his little girl or special one and really doted on me. I leaned on him and I guess he felt he couldn\\'t lean on me. This was the happiest time of my life and the best relationship of my life, but in hindsight I realize we didn\\'t communicate properly. I\\'m sure he had issues and doubts but he was unable to raise them with me, so it was doomed. \\n I always felt like we rushed into things. I have never met a guy that wanted to commit more than me, but he did. Even at the time I suspected he threw himself into this relationship to distract himself from his pain. He always went on and on about how proud he was to be with me and loved to show me off to his friends, it was intoxicating. Even weeks before the break up he talked about how he wanted to deepen the relationship and be \"partners\" rather than just boyfriend and girlfriend. He said he wanted to be my \"person\" and make it his duty care for me and make me happy. \\n I was shocked when he broke up with me, I didn\\'t see it coming. He cried so much, he didn\\'t seem like himself. He felt so small and shaky in my arms. Snot everywhere. I basically just kept telling him it\\'s ok and nothings wrong and we don\\'t need to break up, that he was being rash but he was set on it. I was stunned. I haven\\'t seen him since. \\n I didn\\'t cry that night but I did quite a bit in the following days. I got drunk and texted him basically begging for him back and being a sad sack. I said I\\'d wait as long as he needed and that I was there for him to talk whenever he\\'s ready and that I needed him. I realize now that if he wasn\\'t able to talk when we were together, he wont be now. \\n He was extremely apologetic throughout this, saying he is a horrible human being for hurting the one he cares about and betraying my trust and that I probably hate him now. he seemed genuine to me. He kept saying this wasn\\'t it for us and he\\'d still be here for me. He kept insisting we\\'d be friends but we weren\\'t friends before (we started dating pretty much as soon as we were introduced) \\n I want to meet with him to tell him I accept his decision. I can\\'t stand leaving things off at me begging for him back. He told me he is too depressed to be together and I respect that, besides our relationship could never work if he is unable to express his feelings. I miss him dearly, but I wouldn\\'t want to get back together unless we committed to working on our inability to address his feelings and he went to some sort of grief counseling. I don\\'t want to go through that again, I would need to know it\\'s what he really wanted and now that he was just afraid of being alone or felt guilty for hurting me. I hate to think of him beating himself up over this though, I want to tell him I\\'m ok. \\n Personally, I\\'m not friends with my exes, but I\\'m on good terms. They\\'ve all been friends of friends and being civil post-break up is important to keep my social circle harmonious. I live near him and have mutual friends, we frequent the same places. Running into him seems inevitable. In fact my best friends have run into him a few times already. I don\\'t want to bump into him at the convenience store in my sweat pants or drunk at a bar, or for one of us to be on a date. I\\'d like to plan ahead, be emotionally ready. \\n I feel like meeting for a coffee or a walk in the park would be a good way to get closure. I\\'ve done this with exes before and it has helped me be on good terms. Even if I\\'m the one being dumped it helps to feel like this is something we are deciding together, although my break ups have all been pretty mutual and I have never liked someone they way I liked this guy. I\\'m sure meeting him would make me feel sad, but the last time was so crazy and unexpected, I feel like a convo where nither of us is drunk and crying would help me move on. \\n Also, shortly after my sad begging for him back texts, I lost my phone and my number changed. He could still contact me through face book though and it\\'s probably best I didn\\'t have his number for while there. \\n I\\'m doing ok, all the other things in life are still the same. I was very happy when we were together but he was just one part of it. I still have a good job, good friends, a nice apartment, I\\'m still working on school. I\\'m still just where I want to be. Things are falling into place for me and he was just one piece. \\n In my ideal scenario, He\\'d be his regular self and have a new job. He\\'d be feeling better and we\\'d hug and say we cared. I don\\'t to dissect what went wrong or him to explain. I just want to say it\\'s ok. I never could stand unresolved conflict. \\n Everyone says I should just block him off everything and forget he existed but I can\\'t. I want to be able to look back on our tine together and feel good. \\n I want to reach out to him and clear the air, break the ice or whatever. I read an article for school that I thin he\\'d like. We used to send each other stuff all the time. would that be weird, to pass it along in a friendly way? what about liking things on face book, that\\'s a pretty low key way to say \"I don\\'t hate your guts\"', 'I work in a health food/ organic grocery store.

I\\'m not good at this stuff. \\n This went on for weeks to the point that it must seem obvious to him that I think he\\'s cute. It\\'s a small store and I felt hyper aware of him every time he was in there, and he seemed to be making excuses to talk to me. After spending five minutes helping him pick out ice cream today, I resolved to consult r/dating on how to get a date with this guy. \\n He came back a couple hours later though, and bought a few more things. At the check out he handed me his number and said he\\'d like to get coffee.

I think the \"I\\'m here for you stuff\" is just to be nice and I don\\'t intend to message him again. I really do hope he\\'s doing better. He always seemed like a calm and emotionally stable person to me... seeing him break down like that was really disturbing. \\n I guess I don\\'t like leaving things unsaid and closure is important to me. I feel like a have a tiny bit of control now, that he doesn\\'t think I\\'m just waiting for him to walk back into my life. Sometimes it helps to forgive people, whether they asked for it or not.', 'Two months ago, my boyfriend of 8 month dumped me suddenly. He showed up drunk at my house one night and when I asked him about the fact that I had heard from a mutual friend he had been fired from his job, he broke down sobbing hysterically, calling himself a loser and all sorts of names for hiding it from me, saying that had ruined everything between us. He told me that he was seriously depressed and spent most of his days in bed but had been hiding it from me. He told me he was preparing to go out west to scatter his dad\\'s ashes. His father had died driving driving drunk less than two years ago. He only spoke about him a few times and that was just to hint at his anger and hatred of the man. He has also mentioned that his mother had become an angorophobe and that he was the \"man of the house\" now, in charge of looking after his younger brothers and sisters, who he has conflicts with apparently. He was also very ashamed of the fact that he lives at home and works low-paying jobs despite being very educated (lots of student debt). Also, He\\'s Irish-Italian and Catholicism is a big part of his life culturally but he does not believe in god, I was raised without religion but this a big crisis for him, when I asked him about it months ago he wept, saying he misses god. \\n He was a great boyfriend to me, always caring and supportive when I was stressed or anxious. He very open to listening to my problems but was very tight-lipped when it came to his own. I guess our relationship dynamic was that he was the strong one, he called me his little girl or special one and really doted on me. I leaned on him and I guess he felt he couldn\\'t lean on me. This was the happiest time of my life and the best relationship of my life, but in hindsight I realize we didn\\'t communicate properly. I\\'m sure he had issues and doubts but he was unable to raise them with me, so it was doomed. \\n I always felt like we rushed into things. I have never met a guy that wanted to commit more than me, but he did. Even at the time I suspected he threw himself into this relationship to distract himself from his pain. He always went on and on about how proud he was to be with me and loved to show me off to his friends, it was intoxicating. Even weeks before the break up he talked about how he wanted to deepen the relationship and be \"partners\" rather than just boyfriend and girlfriend. He said he wanted to be my \"person\" and make it his duty care for me and make me happy. \\n I was shocked when he broke up with me, I didn\\'t see it coming. He cried so much, he didn\\'t seem like himself. He felt so small and shaky in my arms. Snot everywhere. I basically just kept telling him it\\'s ok and nothings wrong and we don\\'t need to break up, that he was being rash but he was set on it. I was stunned. I haven\\'t seen him since. \\n I didn\\'t cry that night but I did quite a bit in the following days. I got drunk and texted him basically begging for him back and being a sad sack. I said I\\'d wait as long as he needed and that I was there for him to talk whenever he\\'s ready and that I needed him. I realize now that if he wasn\\'t able to talk when we were together, he wont be now. \\n He was extremely apologetic throughout this, saying he is a horrible human being for hurting the one he cares about and betraying my trust and that I probably hate him now. he seemed genuine to me. He kept saying this wasn\\'t it for us and he\\'d still be here for me. He kept insisting we\\'d be friends but we weren\\'t friends before (we started dating pretty much as soon as we were introduced) \\n I want to meet with him to tell him I accept his decision. I can\\'t stand leaving things off at me begging for him back. He told me he is too depressed to be together and I respect that, besides our relationship could never work if he is unable to express his feelings. I miss him dearly, but I wouldn\\'t want to get back together unless we committed to working on our inability to address his feelings and he went to some sort of grief counseling. I don\\'t want to go through that again, I would need to know it\\'s what he really wanted and now that he was just afraid of being alone or felt guilty for hurting me. I hate to think of him beating himself up over this though, I want to tell him I\\'m ok. \\n Personally, I\\'m not friends with my exes, but I\\'m on good terms. They\\'ve all been friends of friends and being civil post-break up is important to keep my social circle harmonious. I live near him and have mutual friends, we frequent the same places. Running into him seems inevitable. In fact my best friends have run into him a few times already. I don\\'t want to bump into him at the convenience store in my sweat pants or drunk at a bar, or for one of us to be on a date. I\\'d like to plan ahead, be emotionally ready. \\n I feel like meeting for a coffee or a walk in the park would be a good way to get closure. I\\'ve done this with exes before and it has helped me be on good terms. Even if I\\'m the one being dumped it helps to feel like this is something we are deciding together, although my break ups have all been pretty mutual and I have never liked someone they way I liked this guy. I\\'m sure meeting him would make me feel sad, but the last time was so crazy and unexpected, I feel like a convo where nither of us is drunk and crying would help me move on. \\n Also, shortly after my sad begging for him back texts, I lost my phone and my number changed. He could still contact me through face book though and it\\'s probably best I didn\\'t have his number for while there. \\n I\\'m doing ok, all the other things in life are still the same. I was very happy when we were together but he was just one part of it. I still have a good job, good friends, a nice apartment, I\\'m still working on school. I\\'m still just where I want to be. Things are falling into place for me and he was just one piece. \\n In my ideal scenario, He\\'d be his regular self and have a new job. He\\'d be feeling better and we\\'d hug and say we cared. I don\\'t to dissect what went wrong or him to explain. I just want to say it\\'s ok. I never could stand unresolved conflict. \\n Everyone says I should just block him off everything and forget he existed but I can\\'t. I want to be able to look back on our tine together and feel good. \\n I want to reach out to him and clear the air, break the ice or whatever. I read an article for school that I thin he\\'d like. We used to send each other stuff all the time. would that be weird, to pass it along in a friendly way? what about liking things on face book, that\\'s a pretty low key way to say \"I don\\'t hate your guts\"']": "Based on the user's posting history, it seems that the user is interested in relationships, dating, and personal interactions.

I explicitly mentioned infinite in the title, because I'd easily be able to manage a finite world: you could procedurally generate a single texture for the whole mesh (it would be big, but the idea is it could be done/calculated in one go). \\n Anyway, I have a game (ish) written in C++ using OpenGL, that is based around an infinite 3D world that uses a chunk system. As specified with the word 'theoretical' in the title, I don't like using 'infinite' because it's not, but the generation happens on the fly, for an undefined length of time. Each chunk represents 16 metres, so the textures we're talking about here need to be quite 'local' (as opposed to sea here, mountain there, beaches here). It would be low-level ground detail within 16 metres. \\n The problem with this is, the ground detail has to be continuous between chunks, going through their boundaries with no seams. This rules out options one and two, which were: use the same texture for each chunk, but colour it differently and use different textures for chunks in different biomes, for example, because one would look unnatural and two would show blunt edges between textures. \\n Ideally, I would dynamically generate the textures for each chunk: actually 'colour in' a new array of pixels inside the texture depending on the environment. Much like generating the terrain, seams would not be an issue, because if you're at the same place and looking at the same chunk, it will be the same! But I believe OpenGL texture generation is a relatively expensive process, that is usually done at loading time. Considering this would have to be done for every chunk in a 41*41 grid and every time the player crossed a chunk boundary, I've ruled this option out. \\n Back to the title, what do options do I have left? I saw a video on youtube recently in which textures were not actually used for the terrain, but instead, the colour of each pixel was calculated 'mathematically' to colour all the terrain to look very realistic. 'Mathematically' was as far as they went, so if anyone recognises this per-pixel-no-texture wizardry, I'd love to know what is going on here. Something about using pixels as 'pho-atoms'.\", \"referring to the title: ie 'convert' a dynamically allocated array into a static one). \\n I have a member function of a 'Mesh' object I have defined, that requires an array with some (vertex) data inside it. This will be used for drawing in OpenGL (which, I believe, works with either dynamically allocated or static arrays). \\n The Mesh class has a member: \\n float* mVertices;\\n \\n which I plan on initialising in the constructor with new float[] and then by passing in another dynamically allocated array to populate it. Once this is done, then the draw function can use mVertices to draw the object needed, and it will All Just Work^TM. \\n The problem is, I need to pass a  populated  array which is full of data into the constructor, so the argument shown below needs to point to a dynamically allocated array containing data: \\n Mesh::Mesh(float* someArrayOfVerts){\\n    mVertices = arrayOfVerts;\\n}\\n \\n so that mVertices can be populated. As I am doing at the moment (see above), I am passing a dynamically allocated array, but this would not be full as I cannot initialise a DA array like this{-0.5f, 5.0f, 0.0f} etc. I would have to go through each element: \\n array[0] = -0.5f;\\narray[1] = 5.0f;\\narray[2] = 0.0f; \\n \\n and this would obviously be ridiculous for HUGE arrays full of data. \\n My plan is to either \\n a) change the constructor to take in a static array and then convert it to a dynamic one in the body, before setting mVertices to this new dynamic array (which contains all the necessary data).  This would require converting a static array into a dynamically allocated one. \\n b) OR keep the constructor as it is, taking in a DA array, and populate some DA array before the object is created in some other code, and then pass that into the constructor when the mesh is instantiated.  This would require converting a static array into a dynamically allocated one. \\n I'm sorry if I've completely missed something obvious or I've not been clear enough (I hope I made sense!). Any info would be greatly appreciated!\", \"There are many different ways of making mob-killers. Many of which can be done effectively with water, but now we have lots of lava in our worlds I  planned , to use lava in them. \\n Imagine the ladder is the sign (i couldn't get a screenshot before an actual sign burst into flames) and the mobs drop from a spawner down the top funnel. The sign means they can fall straight down through the tip of the lava meaning they catch fire and hit the floor causing them to die. Their loot can then be taken away down water channels to wherever you want :) Another slightly more complex version: \\n Here, the sign (ladder) both holds back the water and lava! The only problem with burning signs, is the only other alternative is ladders and mobs and their items get stuck on top of them, defeating the point of the system.\", \"Hi guys, \\n I'm making a 2D game with procedurally generated, blocky terrain, quite like Terraria. The game loads chunks, and the speed of random number generation greatly affects the speed at which these chunks are loaded. I need a random number generator that is very quick, but is not predictable. \\n How the system works: \\n I have a function, determineHeight(int xPosition) that will return the height of the ground at any, infinitely large x coordinate. This has to be quick, and the speed of this function depends on the speed of the random number generator being used. determineHeight() contains another function, genYCoord(int xPosition) which takes in the xPosition as a seed for the random generator inside, and returns the result of the generator when it is called with that seed. \\n What I have tried so far: \\n I started off with uniform_int_distribution, which - prior to me making a chunk manager - seemed to work OK and it produced great random results. But when the game became more complex, I needed to load chunks individually, and I stugggled with 'jumping' chunk loading, where you would fly through the terrain but you would stop moving as a new chunk was loaded and then continue - they were'nt loading quick enough. I found out that uniform_int_distribution is apparently awfully slow, and so switching to rand() solved my problems, or so I thought... \\n When looking at the terrain generation when zoomed out, I noticed it was extremely predictable - just a long, elaborate repeating pattern. rand() therefore does not work, because the generator is seeded with the xPosition each time (this is done so the worlds are the same, with the same main seed), and then I return rand() % someValue. someValue is always the same, so when determining the ground height, the random number generator loops in a pattern.\", \"In the game I'm trying to create, each Mesh contains its own VAO. This VAO in turn, contains its own buffers for position, colour, and texture coordinates as well as an index buffer. When creating a Mesh, the programmer has the option to populate the data within the buffer objects, after it has been created: filling the buffers with data does not have to happen in the constructor of the Mesh. \\n Once  addMesh(transform, texture, shaderIndex)  has been called inside the body of some  Renderable3D 's constructor, then the mesh can be generated using  mMeshes.back()-&gt;generateMesh()  which takes in vectors of position data, colour data, texture coordinate data and index data. This function then gets this meshes VAO, and fills its buffers with this data that has just been generated. \\n Enough with semi-relevant info... \\n When I call std::make_unique to create a new instance of the same  Renderable3D  object (that contains a mesh), multiple times, all these objects - when rendered - look identical to the last one added, even though their meshes have been generated with different data! Each one is carefully given new position data in the generateMesh function, that is passed to the mesh->VAO->VBO->position data vector, but when rendered only the last data is used for rendering all of them! \\n My first thought was to print the data for each object  and compare raw x, y, z coordinates - that way I could see if the data wasn't being changed or whether it was something else. After manually printing the vertex coordinates for each object ('s mesh) I saw they  were  different, meaning the VAO's VBOs  did  contain different data. This feels like there is OpenGL data being overwritten, rather than created uniquely in a different object, but that is just a guess.\", \"Ik what you mean, same thing happens to me. Because all mapped functions are treated as screen touches, when you look around using the right stick, it is essentially an invisible finger being moved over the screen. But if you very slightly move the right stick (to look around) then it is treated as a very small movement of a finger on the screen. This very small movement is then registered as a touch by MCPE's code (for practical reasons) and so a block is placed.\", 'Hello again, \\n Nearly a month ago, I installed Visual Studio Community 2015.

Each character has a pronunciation that fits Japanese syllables/morae, and some characters have the same pronunciation as others. Each symbol conveys a meaning or idea, and the meaning of a word is conveyed by the symbols in it, in context of each other. For example, \"anus\" is the kanji for \"anal\" (as in, \"of the butt/ass/anus\") and \"gate/opening\". \\n Sometimes, the contextual meaning can change the pronunciation of the grouping of kanji to fit the established japanese word for the meaning. In my previous example, the word is pronounced \"k\u014dmon\", but the two pronunciations for those characters are sufficiently different from the sounds in that word. \\n So your name spelled phonetically with kanji might have multiple interperetations.

Probably not. \\n I guess my point is that while using an intentionally slow algorithm may buy a little time, system administrators need to stay on top of the security of their systems so that they can quickly identify intrusions, and follow procedures to remedy the problem, force everyone to change their passwords, and notify users of the intrusion when and where appropriate. As an application developer, providing the widest array of reasonable options and ways for sysadmins to easily switch between them is probably the best thing you can do.

One example of a neurotransmitter that plays a significant role in addictive behavior is oxytocin, which is found in the nervous system in virtually all vertebrates. An increase in release of oxytocin in the brain has demonstrated to correlate with addictive behaviors such as reproduction, food consumption, consumption of certain kinds of drugs (e.g. cocaine), and emotional attachment. Dopamine is another neurotransmitter involved with the brain's reward system and correlates with sensations such as pleasure and happiness.\", 'Water is the most abundant molecule in all cells, and the air that we breathe in and out of the body passes through this moist environment.

Microevolution describes how a gene pool (gene pool= the collective comparison of all the various gene types, also called alleles, found within all the individuals of a given population) changes from generation to generation, whereas macroevolution describes how evolving populations result in speciation. One example of a speciation mechanism would be if a population got split into two populations and were then isolated from each other (e.g. separated by a geological barrier) so that both of them could no longer interbreed and exchange genetic information. They would no longer occupy the same environment, and would therefor have different selective pressures to determine which mutated genes are added to their gene pools. As the two populations continue to evolve independently from each other, the accumulation of microevolutionary changes (changes in the gene pool from generation to generation) needs only to reach a point where neither of the populations can successfully reproduce with each other. Once this point is reached, it no longer matters if the populations get mixed together again, because neither of them can contribute to the other's gene pool. As time increases, so will the genetic divergence between the two populations (they could also now be labeled as two different species since they are incapable of reproducing with each other), and if their respective environments favor the survival of both populations/species, then their offspring can continue on to form populations of their own that can result in other various speciation processes and so on and so on.\", \"I've read one of William Dembski's books on this issue and have attended lectures of creation scientists that throw out the usual astronomical probabilities. I'm mostly just familiar with the probabilities that are asserted by the intelligent design community for abiogenesis and rates of evolution. As far as probabilities for abiogenesis, they're completely bogus. The probability models are based on the assumption that atoms just randomly came together all at once to form the cell or the macromolecules that we observe in extant species today. It ignores the fact that we can experimentally demonstrate the spontaneous synthesis of the molecular building blocks of life in early Earth conditions and that a leading model for the first primitive cell doesn't even exist yet to test for abiogenesis probabilities. The probability models often proposed by YECs for population genetics concerning the rate of evolution are harder to argue. This is mainly because the scientific investigation of the relationship between mutation rates and their selective pressures is basically still in its infancy. There really isn't a scientific consensus on the most accurate methodology for producing these probability models, although it should be noted that typically the methodology and results from YEC scientist probability calculations are pretty different than that of most other methods used by scientists. Also, these probability models are based on very complex computer simulations that most biologists are not qualified to critique, and the results attained by YECs don't match the experimental evidence of evolution rates that are measured in the lab/wild.\", 'That\\'s just pure bullshit. I grew up as a YEC (mostly in the Bible Belt) until my early 20s because it was really the only view that I had been exposed to. My understanding of the big bang and evolution was that millions of years ago everything came from an explosion out of nothing, and then life randomly came into existence whereupon a bacterium could become a fish or a tree by simply deciding to do so. Since this was my limited understanding, it\\'s no wonder I thought these \"theories\" were too ridiculous to believe.  I was ignorant of the science at the time, and was under a strong influence of cognitive biases since virtually every adult that I had personally known and looked up to while growing up was a YEC fundamentalist. It wasn\\'t until college that I began debating atheists on youtube about things like cosmic/biological evolution and Biblical contradictions. 99% of those that I debated were quite arrogant and condescending, and this ultimately just made it too easy to ignore whatever evidence they gave and made me more confident in my views. Finally, I found out that one of my close friends at college was an atheist, and this really shocked me since he didn\\'t fit the stereotype that I was taught by the many fundamentalists that I grew up with. He was friendly, honest, and clearly loved his friends and family. Once I found out he was an atheist, we began discussing over the next few weeks our beliefs and how we rationalize these beliefs. He was able to effectively explain his evidence and reasoning without getting impatient or flustered, or even in a way that made it seem like he was trying to prove me wrong. He pretty much used the same exact arguments that the atheists used when I debated them online, but the difference was their attitude was essentially the opposite of that of my friend\\'s. After weeks of us discussing topics of why we exist and hearing him continuously present factual evidence, my walls of cognitive bias finally broke, and that\\'s when I first  really  started to question my worldview. I began reading books by scientists, such as NDT and Dawkins, and watching countless video lectures and documentaries on science and religion. Over a course of two years, I went from identifying myself as a Christian to identifying as an atheist, and I have my friend\\'s persistent and patient attitude to thank for this. I have since then met quite a few other atheists that were once YEC, and many of them also \"de-converted\" by being exposed to logic and evidence in one way or another.', 'I\\'ll first start off by saying that I think you would really benefit from checking out  Biologos . They actually have quite a few reputable scientists and scholars that contribute to their collection of literature. I\\'ll just put it this way: I\\'ve read a good amount of literature referenced by Biologos and as a result, I\\'ve come to a fairly confident conclusion that our scientific understanding of the origins of life and the universe are compatible with what\\'s presented in the Genesis creation account and Christian theology (I\\'m an atheist). \\n And now here\\'s my bit on the statistics of abiogenesis: \\n The statistical arguments used against abiogenesis are analogous to the common argument \"it\\'s just a theory!\" that\\'s often used against evolution, in that both arguments are based on a misunderstanding of abiogenesis/evolution. I encourage you to research and find for yourself where these statistics of abiogenesis come from and how they are calculated, but if you feel comfortable taking my word for it, then I\\'ll go ahead and save you a lot of tedious hours by informing you that there currently is no such thing as a statistical approach to abiogenesis that\\'s in any way meaningful or accurate. In order to analyze the statistical likelihood of a certain physical process to occur, one must first understand and define what that process is. The statistical numbers that YECs use as an argument against abiogenesis will often come from popular creationist book authors, such as William Dembski or Stephen Meyer. One particular aspect of this that puzzles me is that these YEC proponents love to state how \"there\\'s no scientific evidence for how the process of abiogenesis occurred\" (which simply isn\\'t true) and yet the way that they try to refute abiogenesis as the explanation for the origin of life is by statistically measuring this \"unknown\" process. Furthermore, these statistical analyses aren\\'t based on any model for abiogenesis that\\'s currently accepted within the scientific community. Many of them are literally just statistical measurements of individual atoms randomly coming together to form a complete cell or organic macromolecule (e.g. DNA, proteins, etc.), and the cellular/molecular structures that they analyze are completely based on extant (i.e. currently living; not extinct) organisms. Any kind of meaningful statistical approach to abiogenesis would involve knowing the precise chemical pathway that was used (which involves a timespan of ~500 million years), as well as being confident that all of the parameters for the entire process are accounted for. Our current gap of knowledge in the process of abiogenesis thus renders any kind of reliable statistical likelihood to essentially be immeasurable. This is why you won\\'t find any of these statistical arguments published in scientific literature. \\n There are a several leading models for the chemical processes of abiogenesis, and scientists are actually able to describe plausible chemical pathways that could occurred have naturally evolved into a functioning primitive cell. These models require a rather in-depth understanding of the molecular structure and function of cellular life in order to intuitively grasp how the natural organic molecules of early Earth could have chemically evolved into a self-replicating cell, and so most people of the general public aren\\'t equipped with the knowledge that they need in order to explain the scientific concept of abiogenesis or refute arguments against it (which also means that the ones arguing against abiogenesis probably have no clue of what they\\'re talking about and/or they are terribly misinformed).']": "Based on the user's reddit posting history, it appears that the user is primarily interested in discussing and debating topics related to cosmology, physics, evolution, Christian theology, and atheism.", "[\"Try and cover some niche markets like BB/PL/etc but not scare away the 'normal' guy and girl gym goers. \\n This is key.

There job is to automatically keep the valve lash within spec. I know that on 1.6L and 1.8L Mazda Miata engines the HLA\\'s have a bad habit that i think is occurring to your engine as well. \\n What happens is the oil inside of the HLA\\'s becomes dirty after 80k+ miles and the oil cannot cycle through the adjusters properly, and such become  very  dirty. This does not affect how the engine performs, it just makes the valvetrain noisy on start up at first until the oil warms up, and after many miles they can make a less pronounced noise constantly (most noticeable in the lower RPM range). \\n The only fix for this is to take the top half of the engine apart, remove the HLA\\'s, disassemble them, clean them, and refill them with new oil. As you can imagine, this can be quite costly. You may have some luck adding some SeaFoam to your oil about 500 or so miles before your next oil change to try and clean them out. \\n However, it could also be something as simple as your oil filter. Many OEM oil filters have a \"check valve\" in them, the valves purpose is to keep oil from flowing out of the top (valvetrain) of the engine when it is not running. Starting a car with low oil in the top of the motor will cause a noise very similar to what you are describing. Many of the cheaper oil filters lack this check valve and will cause what i described above to occur each time the car is started.', \"To me this issue sounds like it's related to your spark plugs. \\n Heavy throttle at highway speeds puts a lot of load on your engine causing EGT's (exhaust gas temps.) to skyrocket. Generally speaking, the higher your EGT, the higher the temp is in the combustion chamber, and very high temps can cause funny things to happen to spark plugs, things like mis-fires and pre-ignition conditions can start to appear, but only while the spark plugs are super hot. \\n This could be as simple as having the wrong temperature range plugs installed for your needs. (BUR 7 EQ vs BUR 9 EQ, ect.) Or  having a gap on the spark plugs thats too small causing the spark temp to be far too high when EGT's are high as well.

Things that should be common knowledge to anyone living here. The quiz is worth a total of 50 points. You will earn those points by correctly answering five multiple choice questions. To answer all five questions correctly, you first need to understand that you are really being quizzed on your ability to follow instructions. The correct answers for the purposes of this quiz are not the right answers. The correct answers are those answers that the very next sentence explicitly instructs you to choose. For each question in this quiz, you are to choose the one answer that names a city that is not located in the State of Utah. If you do so, you will have correctly answered each of the questions in this quiz. You also will have demonstrated an ability and willingness to wade through even the most tedious of instructions in order to know what is required before you begin. Most important, you will have earned full points\u2014because you followed instructions! On the other hand, if you do not answer the questions correctly in accordance with these instructions, you will be affirming that you cannot be bothered with instructions.

I went to my mother's church, and I'm starting to get some real issues with the head pastor. \\n His sermons have always been extremely emotionally manipulative, but it seems like now more then ever he's using that to make people feel bad about themselves instead of using it to help people.  I don't know how intentional this is - I don't want to ascribe some malicious agenda to him that isn't there - but I've seen way to much of this same behavior for me to think he's doing it unintentionally. \\n While I recognize that there is an acceptable level of emotional manipulation in public speaking, the way he's going about it seems particularly noxious as they all tend to follow the pattern of making people feel bad about something, and then telling them God will fix the problem for them, which quite simply isn't something he can promise.  People simply leave church feeling worse then they did before going in. \\n Secondly, he's delving into some really frighteningly paranoid theology.  He asked us to lay hands on our mothers and pray for them today - which is fine - but then he started talking about casting out demons from our mothers.  There's more bad ideas in here then I really care to get into, but suffice it to say that I consider this idea to be psychologically dangerous, unbiblical, arrogant, and offensive, and I don't believe it to be a view that the majority of the church would agree with.  The sort of views he is pushing seem to me like they can literally only bring psychological damage to believers. \\n So, I'm asking here: what should I do about this?  Is it my place to intervene in a church that isn't my own?  Would there be an appropriate way to talk to the pastor about this without it coming across as me condemning him, or worse, as an argument about theology?\", \"You are a liberal Christian if you don't subscribe to the Orthdox interpretations of scripture.  That's really the only good definition.  A lot of people try to make it about literal or non-literal, but that doesn't really work either - we all agree that the Bible has a literal and non-literal readings.  The literal/non-literal Bible approach thing is a strawman argument, in my opinion, because no one says that the whole Bible is literal and no one says the whole bible is non-literal, and in any case whether or not the events described happened is usually not relevant to the actual theological points which are questioned.\", 'God is in our mundane existence just as much as He is in the lofty heavens, if not even more so.

It seems to me that we only think this is true because these are the only songs we know from the day.  No one went out to dance and listened to hymns, you know?  They had their classical and folk and all sorts of \"popular\" and \"art\" styles of music separate from sacred music. \\n >Is their any scriptural support for the idea that worship music must sound disimilar to secular music? \\n Is there any scriptural support for the idea that worship music is permitted to sound similar to secular music? \\n Obviously, that isn\\'t a serious question.  I don\\'t think that\\'s a fair question for a couple reasons: 1.) I never introduced the language of requirement into this discussion and I don\\'t think either of us want to go down that road, and given that, we get to 2.) it doesn\\'t have to be in the scripture for it to be a main feature of Christian worship practices, since 90% of Christian worship and liturgy developed after the Bible. \\n >If anything Paul\\'s treatise on meat that has been sacrificed to idols speaks directly against the idea that something can be profaned in such a way. \\n I didn\\'t mean profane in that sense, I meant it in the sense of [The Idea of the Holy]( with the profane being the opposite of the sacred.  Basically, the concept is that the whole concept of \"holiness\" is being \"set apart,\" the root of the word in Hebrew, and we get the notion of something being holy because it is different then normal life.  This, I believe, applies to worship practices, and gives a psychological explanation for why non-liturgical worship is such a minority practice in the church both historically and in modern times.', \"For example: intolerance is not a sin...

If that's an important consideration, Dundee will be the cheapest to live in but not by far. Glasgow is only slightly more expensive. \\n Neither Dundee nor Glasgow are particularly stabby, that's a reputation consolidated a decade ago and built up in their post-industrial decline days. Knife crime in Glasgow is down 67% since 2006/2007. Knife crime in Scotland, as a whole, is down 60%. I've never encountered any problems in either city, if I'm being honest. \\n Dundee's art scene is growing, more pubs etc., and is in the middle a big regeneration. The entire waterfront is a building site at the moment. It's sort of small, but big enough that it has most of the amenities you'd expect to find in Glasgow, though with limited choice. Clubs are decent, their Student Union is by far the best in Scotland. \\n Glasgow is by far the biggest city of the three. Most amenities, relatively cheap, lots of regeneration going on, big arts scene, music scene etc. \\n If I were you, I'd rule out Aberdeen. The reputation of the University is slipping, the rent is very expensive, and the nightlife, though good, is also very expensive. It is, however, the city you're most likely to find a part time job in due to how well their economy is doing (oil wealth). \\n My first choice would be Glasgow University. Pretty cheap, as these things go, the University has a good reputation, the city has a lot going for it, the stereotypes don't apply to the city, not really, and, if you're not into clubbing, it's the city you're more likely to find alternatives in. \\n Dundee would be my insurance. Best reputation for Bioscience, though the overall university isn't as highly regarded as Aberdeen or Glasgow. It's viewed better than Stathclyde though. The city is relatively nice, though probably a bit boring after four years. In terms of cost, it's the most affordable. \\n Strathclyde has the poorest reputation and its Bioscience department is also the least well-regarded of the four.

It exports a lot of oil and gas; cutting that off overnight would stall the rUK economy. You can't make up that significant a chunk of your energy needs that quickly cf. Russia-EU relations right now. You also can't relocate nuclear submarines, weapons and all their handling facilities overnight. \\n I think you are massively massively massively underestimating the degree to which completely severing ties with Scotland would fuck the rUK over.

A recognition that there's no need to impoverish or punish anyone and that this transition doesn't require a detour via the total independence in the extreme North Korea way before returning to the interdependent norm of Western Europe.

GDP per capita (PPP) is three times higher in the UK than it is in Romania. The UK is the fastest growing G7 nation in terms of GDP. The average Brit earns as much in a week as a Romanian earns in a month. \\n But I think the best measure of how 'shitty' a country is can be divined from where people want to live, which is measured, by proxy, by immigration. In the year to march, 124,000 more people migrated to the UK, from the EU, then left the country. \\n Maybe you could argue that the UK had a shitty foreign policy, I wouldn't disagree, but your anecdote about you, specifically, doing well in Romania doesn't make it a better country to live in than the UK.

You see this with tuition fees and you can also see this in health and education, too. \\n I'm not sure the contention being made is actually supported by the evidence presented. Firstly, so what if the amount of money being directed towards those services isn't going up, the important metric is how well they're being run. Surely the FT realise that chucking money at something isn't a sure-fire recipe for improving the quality of the service? \\n As a proxy measure for how 'protected' the services are, we might look at how satisfied the public is with the NHS. In Scotland, despite apparently real terms falls, there is a 75% satisfaction rating. That compares with 65%, and admittedly improving, level of satisfaction in England (and only 51% in Wales where Labour - realistically the only other party that is a serious contender for government at Holyrood - is in power). \\n Secondly, if spending is already higher, and public satisfaction is higher, and performance is broadly-speaking equivalent, then did the NHS revenue budget actually need more money in it? And surely this is the benefit of devolution? Different priorities and different needs. It's somewhat empty-headed to just look at the headline figures and not put them in context. (This article is better than most for doing it but most of the politicians rattle the figure off without context). \\n Thirdly, anyone paying attention knows that the SNP have been pursuing a policy of chucking the kitchen sink at infrastructure spending. That's the overriding message I took away from their 2011 manifesto (which I've just reskimmed).  Their current message is slightly different  and a minor departure. They've now moved from protecting just the 'revenue' budget to wanting to increase spending 0.5% per annum to allow investment through the NHS's capital budget (and more of the same on other infrastructure spending).\"]": "Based on the user's reddit posting history, it can be inferred that the user is interested in the following areas:\n\n1.

My parents had untrained dogs and were criticizing how I was raising my own. \\n A few weeks after that thread, my folks left for Europe for a full month. That meant I got to babysit their dogs and watch over their house. I took every opportunity that month to train their dogs and take them out! \\n That meant going to the dog park 4-5 times a week, 2-3 beach trips a week, and at least one hike a week! That also meant going back to basics and potty training their dogs, which was surprisingly easy. My parents were never consistent with their dogs, but a month changed a lot of things! \\n When my folks got back, they were so amazed that I potty trained their dogs - they finally started listening to me! They were also ecstatic to be able to allow their dogs free roam of the house without fear of accidents. I'm now teaching my parents to stop feeding the dogs while we're eating, how to adjust their tone of voice to give commands, and how to curb a lot of their dogs' behaviors. The only thing that they won't budge on is allowing their dogs to bark throughout the day - but I know the city is about to get involved (since a couple neighbors have told me they've sent complaints), and I'll be there to help my folks when that happens. \\n Lastly, I've finally convinced my retired parents to take a more proactive lifestyle for both their dogs and their own sakes. I'm typing this on my phone as we're driving to go camping together as a family. They're also joining me on hikes, on trips to the dog park, and trips to the beach more often now. I hope they keep it up even after I leave for grad school. \\n After the last month, it's really nice to know that anything is possible with some patience.\", 'I can\\'t breathe. I can\\'t see. I can\\'t swallow. I can\\'t fucking do anything. I\\'ve been sneezing non-stop for the last THREE hours. I have a fucking migraine from how many times I\\'ve gone  \"AAAAYYYY-CHOOO\".  I\\'m so sick of the sound of my own sneezing, I can only imagine that I\\'m driving my housemates crazy. \\n My nose has been running like a faucet. I\\'ve gone through TWO rolls of toilet paper. That\\'s so fucking stupid. On top of that, I can\\'t keep my eyes open for more than 30 seconds before I feel the incessant need to claw my eyes out. \\n I seriously feel like my head is going to explode. My eyes, nose, and throat feel like they\\'ve been stung by the fury of a thousand mosquitoes. Everything is swollen, uncomfortable, and itches SO DAMN MUCH. It doesn\\'t help that my head is exploding EVERY THIRTY SECONDS from a God damned sneeze. \\n I have a 6 page essay worth 30% of my course grade due tomorrow, and I can\\'t string two sentences together without spraying my mucus all over the screen. I\\'ve already done that twice during the writing of this post. \\n I\\'ve gone through cases of flu, strep, concussions, and worse - and STILL managed to finish deadlines and go to class. This is the only time where I seriously need a fucking break, but I know I\\'d get laughed at if I asked for it. Could anyone imagine me telling my professor \"I couldn\\'t write my essay because my nose was FJKDSYHFUIaHFDKJSFH\\'ing all over the place?\" \\n What a fucking joke. I feel like my brain is about to explode out of my skull.', 'I\\'m a young looking 23 year old Asian guy. I was entering my first year teaching at the high school level. The first day was last week and I had told all of my department members I was going to do it. Some of them even helped set it up. \\n The day went hilariously. \\n I wrote up on the board \"INSTRUCTIONS: Introduce yourself to as many people as you can and tell your  best  story!\" I had different coworkers come into my class period at the beginning of each prep and tell the students Mr. Augustane was running late making copies. My students were to begin the activity without me until I arrived. \\n I wore a hoodie over my dress shirt and tie and brought one of my old backpacks. During the periods I sat down in the seats and introduced myself as the new student named \\'Jeremy Lin\\' and told some of my best stories. Dates and age were changed of course, haha. About 5-10 minutes after introducing myself and hearing several students\\' stories, I would step to the front of the class and stand on a table, then reveal myself... to the shock of all of my students. It was pretty funny how some students who were quite  caddy  catty looked when they realized who I was. \\n In one period in particular, however, I was seated next to a gentleman who proceeded to tell me \"Oh man, this period is going to go APESHIT.\" The conversation continued like this: \\n Him: I had [name], [name], and [name] in my ___ class last year and we  wrecked  wreaked havoc. We drove that teacher nuts. \\n Me: Oh. [name], [name], and [name]? \\n Him: Yeah. They\\'re cool guys. I\\'m pretty sure we\\'re going to eat this teacher alive. \\n Me: Why? \\n Him: He\\'s a first year teacher. They never know what the hell they\\'re doing. All they ever do is stick to the textbook and generally suck. \\n Me: Do you know anything else about this Mr. Augustane? \\n Him: No, not really, but he\\'s probably going to be really slow and boring. First year teachers always are. He won\\'t have control of this class. I don\\'t think he\\'ll be any good. \\n At that moment, I put my hand on his shoulder, and said something along the lines of \"Don\\'t worry buddy, I\\'m sure I\\'ll do fine.\" before stepping up to the class and revealing myself. The class really did go apeshit, but for different reasons. (: \\n The look on that kid\\'s face was priceless. I was sure to thank him for pointing out all the trouble makers for me afterwards. \\n By 5th and 6th period, all the students were scanning around trying to figure out where I could\\'ve been hiding. They were accusing different Asian students of being the teacher. \\n Overall it was a great start before laying down the rules and syllabus the following day. I was nervous it was going to be a terrible idea, but now my students won\\'t stop joking about it.', \"I want to start with a bit of background. \\n I'm a very lucky guy. Extremely lucky. I won the lottery at birth with two absolutely amazing parents. They've helped me save up my retirement, paid my entire college tuition (undergraduate and graduate), and have taken every precaution to make sure that I (and whatever family I may eventually have) will be set for life. \\n My aunt is an extremely kind hearted woman, but she has a medley of psychological issues. She suffers from paranoia schizophrenia and refuses to acknowledge she has a problem. She divorced a very successful man and received hundreds of thousands in their divorce, but still believes he, the mafia, and government is out to ruin her 10 years later. \\n She decided to create her own real estate business with her divorce money in the middle of the 2008 recession. She held onto that business until 2013 when she was reduced to living in her car. Eventually after her business closed, she moved in with my grandma. This was to the distaste of a lot of family members, especially since they saw her as a mooch and had warned her about ditching her business sooner. It was also frustrating because she refused to get any job considered 'menial' because she believed it was below her. She wanted to be her own boss, so she's been mostly jobless since then. \\n She is my dad's younger sister and is very close to him, mainly because he is the only sibling (of 11) who takes time to listen to her and supports her through her issues. He's the most successful in the family and occasionally gives her money to get by. I'm close to her too since I really sympathize with her. None of my other 24 cousins ever talk to her at family gatherings because they don't want to hear her talk about the mafia. Her own adult son doesn't let her see her grandchild because of her issues. She had to sneak into her grandson's school just to give him his birthday present. It's heartbreaking. I've tried my best whenever I visited my grandma to take both her and my grandma to lunch, which is about once a month. While she doesn't acknowledge it, she's sick, just like how I had suffered from depression in the past. I can relate to that. \\n So here's the situation. \\n I recently finished my masters degree and my parents decided to basically gift me most of a house in my hometown. They're selling it to me at half the market value with no interest on my payments, with payment scaling with my salary so that I can afford cost of living (it's a very expensive area to live in). So of course I based all of my plans around this house and landed a job in the area. All contracts signed. \\n My dad suddenly brings it up to me, after I've signed the contracts, that he would like me to let my aunt live in what would become a modified extension of the house. My grandma was downsizing and couldn't house my aunt any longer. I love my aunt dearly, but I'm just  not comfortable with this at all.  He's been pressuring me, to my mom's protest, to agree to it. He's been stating that the house was such an extravagant gift and it's too much for just me and my girlfriend to live in by ourselves. \\n I need my privacy. Both my girlfriend and I will be living there and we want it to be 'our space'. If I had known before signing the contract with my job, I wouldn't have agreed. I would've just lived and worked somewhere more affordable. \\n Now I've just finished up my masters degree and my aunt gave me an iPhone 6 Plus as a present. I'm not sure if she's doing this out of the generosity of her heart, since I'm the only kid in the family to make an effort to treat her like a real human being, or if this is something to 'help' me in my decision. Where she got the money for it, lord knows. It's well beyond her means. I already have an iPhone 6 that I've only had 4 months. I don't like the 6 plus because it feels like a tablet more than a phone. At this point I honestly want to just give the phone to my dad for Father's Day because 1) he deserves it for everything he's done for me 2) his vision is getting worse and it'll be easier for his eyes 3) I don't want the phone to go to waste. \\n I don't know how awkward that'll be though, if she knows I re-gifted her present. At the same time... I just don't like the phone! How awkward is it if I don't use it? Isn't it a waste? Do I just suck it up and use it? I also worry what might happen if she personally presses me to live at the house instead of through my dad (I sure hope she doesn't). Will the phone possibly be used at leverage? By her or my dad? What do I do and how do I do it tactfully?\", \"Hi there. I have an adorable guy named Ted who's 3 1/2 years old. He's fixed and lives with myself, my girlfriend, another cat, and my dog. \\n He's had a few issues with peeing outside the litterbox about a year ago, but it was corrected with CatAttract litter. However his inappropriate urinating has come back in full force without any rhyme or reason. I made sure to take him to the vet ASAP, but they found nothing. He's specifically attacking our couch, but has peed on piles of laundry and our bath mat. \\n He did not begin inappropriately urinating with the introduction of the second cat or dog, so I do not think it is territorial or stress induced from the other animals. However I tried my best to cover the bases by purchasing two FeliAway diffusers for my place. I also remembered to switch over to CatAttract. I then switched to a UTI preventative food that help prevent crystals that may cause urinating, as well as making sure he gets a can of wet food every 1-2 days. \\n Despite all of this, I'm still waking up every 1-2 days to puddles of urine on my couch. Previously it had been piles of clothing and the bath mat (until I threw that out). I don't understand what's going on! It's been a month of this and I've spent so much money on laundry! \\n What should I do? Please help me!\", 'Well, I never really got to know my dad that much when I was a kid. I was 7 and when he received his new job at Kaiser Hospital as an on-call surgeon. From there, I\\'d go to school at 8am and slept at 10pm at night. He\\'d get every bit of sleep until 9am and worked as late as 3am sometimes. Since he was so busy and I couldn\\'t stay up, we essentially never saw each other on the week days. \\n I never understood as a kid why he had to abandon family dinners and run to surgery all the time either. I also remember always asking my mum why my dad slept so much on the weekends and couldn\\'t spend time with me. Eventually I just stopped asking and accepted that my dad just wasn\\'t a big part of my life anymore. \\n Because of the distance that developed throughout my childhood, I never really accepted my dad as a father figure in my life, even though he was right there in the same house. He realized how much he had missed out and he truly made an effort to get to know me more... \\n ...but I was a brash stupid teenager at the time. I didn\\'t know him that well and I didn\\'t want to associate with him. Even my mum had a hard time talking to me at that age. Regardless of that fact, I was an absolute turd to my dad and I still regret to this day the heartache I caused him New Years 2006. \\n I (for a reason I can\\'t remember) ended up swinging my fist at him and getting into a full blown brawl and fistfight with him in front of my entire extended family. I ended up making him bleed. \\n Not only that, I added insult to injury by saying \"I never had a dad. He died when I was seven.\" \\n I heard later that he cried. He cried when I denounced him in front of his brothers and sisters. He cried in the mornings when he missed seeing me off to school. He cried when he had to leave us during dinner to save a life. He cried because he couldn\\'t be there for me to see me grow up. He cried because he did all he could for his son who simply didn\\'t care. \\n I cry now - because he never lost faith in me. \\n I love my dad.', 'About a month ago I posted [this]( thread in /r/dogs and [this]( in /r/australianshepherd asking for advice on an Australian Shepherd puppy I was going to adopt. I knew that I wanted my puppy a long time ago, did the research, but was extremely worried about things I might not have been able to expect. I didn\\'t know if my cats would hate him, if crate training was going to be difficult, or if I would even be able to properly train him from such a young age among other things. My parents\\' constant doubt and warnings about young puppies didn\\'t help either. \\n Because of the holidays and timing, I ended up getting my \\'lil guy a little early too! He\\'s only seven weeks old instead of eight. I seriously didn\\'t know what to expect, but despite that, I was still shocked with what happened next. \\n My pup, August [you probably see the theme I have going], was extremely calm around my cats when they met. Mind you he\\'s had no training or interaction with cats up to this point. I immediately started teaching him a \"leave\" command and he picked up on it very quickly. After half an hour, he no longer rushed at my cats, which made them much calmer around him. Within another hour they were able to coexist in the same room without any hissing. Within two hours my pup had made friends with my younger cat, where both started drinking from the same water bowl. I....didn\\'t see that coming. \\n As for basic house training, aside from peeing on the floor the first moment he came into the house, he has had 0 accidents. He\\'s voided himself promptly every time I\\'ve taken him out and said \"potty\". Like clockwork, he whines and begs at the same time intervals, which has made potty training a breeze. He\\'s also left the cats\\' food and litter alone after a couple scoldings. This has only been the second night with him, but he\\'s been solid about avoiding anything I tell him to \"leave\" or say \"no\" to. He even naturally slept in his crate the first night and is sleeping in the closed crate as I\\'m typing this. Aside from the occasional reminding \"no\"s and whining in the crate, the first two nights with my pup have been worry-free. I\\'ve had to wake up every two hours, but he\\'s so consistent, that I\\'m getting solid blocks of sleep. \\n While I know accidents are unavoidable and will eventually happen, I can\\'t help but be amazed at how quickly August has picked up everything I\\'ve trained him to do. He\\'s exponentially becoming more obedient, responsive, and behaving. I\\'d say he\\'s easier than the kids that I work with at my job. \\n I can\\'t wait for the adventures we\\'re going to have together, especially since he\\'s already been amazing so early. He really is a Christmas miracle for me. I just really needed to share this with the world. \\n Thanks so much for the advice and support in my previous thread.

I\\'m a guy in my mid-40s who has slowly been getting into better shape over the past 10 years.  I was never an \"athlete\", but did do quite a bit of working out back when I was in my late teens/early 20s.  I was in good shape up until I started working, and then all exercise stopped.  No lifting, no cardio.  I quickly became skinny-fat, and at 150 lbs, I looked doughy and dumpy. \\n Once I hit my 30s, I went from skinny-fat to just plain  fat .  My weight went up to 205 lbs.  Every few years I would get a gym membership and dabble at cardio and lifting, but there was never a plan, and it never lasted more than a few weeks.  Lots of fuckarounditis and excuses.  Many of my relatives are grossly overweight and I was turning into one of them. \\n In 2002, I started a new job and on my first day of work, while walking to the office on a hot day, I had to stop half way because I was out of breath and my legs were cramping.  It was really pathetic - here I was in my mid-30s and  I couldn\\'t walk a mile without stopping .  How the hell was I going to play with my kids when they got older?  What kind of example was I setting?  In that moment, I decided to change my life. \\n I joined a gym near my office and started working out with a trainer.  He wasn\\'t the best trainer in the world, and he spouted lots of broscience, but he was an excellent motivator.  I was lifting with him 3 days a week, and doing elliptical 2 days a week, and my weight dropped to 175 over a period of a year (helped along by doing low-carb).  My bench went from ~90 lbs up to a 1 RM of 305 in two years!  I was putting on lots of muscle mass, but after I stopped doing Atkins, my weight went back up to 185. \\n Back in 2010, I started working out with a strength coach who was much more knowledgable than my former trainer, and he helped me immensely with my form.  He also strongly encouraged me to drop my body fat level down, as it was still over 20%.  I had never been a runner - I have a minor case of exercise induced asthma, and running would set it off almost immediately.  But he talked me into it, and I started C25K.  Over a summer, I was running 5K non-stop and I really started to  enjoy  running.  He also encouraged me to avoid grains, dairy and processed foods.  In February 2010, I joined  Fitocracy . By the end of 2011, my body weight dropped below 170 lbs for the first time in over a decade. \\n That\\'s when I signed up for BTFC Round 3.', 'Photos:  [Proof]( - [Front]( - [Side]( - [Back]( \\n Post ID:  yg205 \\n League:  Advanced \\n Goal:  Fat loss \\n \\n My Goals \\n Get weight back down to <160 lbs! \\n Normally I\\'d be setting goals to improve my lifts, but after 6 months of suffering from arm tendonitis, which was finally fixed after 3 months of physical therapy, I\\'ve decided to lift lighter weights with more reps.

Which was definitely the right choice by my psychiatrist at the time, because even though I was started on the lowest dose possible for the antidepressant, it still made me manic. So the new combo actually was working pretty awesome. I felt so level and normal; not even close to manic anymore. \\n I have been having a lot of stress at work lately. They've been wanting me to work lots of overtime. Twice now I've come in for a Saturday 5am shift, so I have to get up at 4am (I normally work night shift), and show up at work to find someone else was already there. My boss keeps forgetting that she already scheduled someone when she asks me to come in. It's so frustrating, because it's already a stressful hospital job to begin with, and the shifts are 10 hours. I feel very overworked already, and stuff like this happening makes me so upset. My boss knows that I'm bipolar. I explained to her that I get stressed out fairly easily compared to others, and that I only work part time because I had decided full time work was too stressful. \\n When I was working full time here I almost ran away and tried to have myself committed. \\n I don't know. I'm just really stressed and upset. I called into work today and didn't eat or leave my bed for the entire day. I even cried for the first time in months.

I am bipolar II with occasional psychosis, anxiety, and some recent self harm urges. I\\'ve gotten to the point where I don\\'t leave my room (plenty of time for research I guess), or even eat on most days. It\\'s pretty bad. The only thing I make sure to do is go to work, feed my cat, or the other pets, my roommate\\'s cat and dog, if no one else is home. I also sometimes drive one roommate to work when he needs a ride. \\n So anyway, I told one of my roommates about my idea of getting a service dog, and explained all the different ways it could help me, and how in the end I will likely become more of an active person do to the needs of the dog, and the fact that I\\'ll be able to bring the dog with me to stores, etc. She came back a few days later and said after discussing it with the other roommates, that they decided they don\\'t want me to get it. \\n I talked to my other roommate myself when giving him a ride and he was only told that I wanted a dog, not that it would be a service dog, or what it would be for. Once I explained it to him, he said he was fine with it as long as it didn\\'t go into his room. \\n The other two roommates are a couple and are still resistant to the idea, and I\\'m fairly certain it\\'s because they were planning on getting another dog for their dog to play with, which they had mentioned before. They have actually said the words that if I get a service dog their will be too many \"pets\" in the house, especially since they are bringing another dog in later. \\n I\\'m seeing my therapist tomorrow, and my psychiatrist the next day to see if I will be able to even get a service dog, but I\\'m not sure what to do if I do get prescribed one. My roommates are people I\\'ve been friends with for 16 years. It blows my mind that they care more about getting another puppy than they do about my health and safety. \\n Even our other friends who know everything about my illness, and who have witnessed bad moments agree that I should have someone, or something with me that is trained to help, or interrupt these moments. We\\'re worried about my chances of ending up in hospital, but we\\'re also worried that they\\'re going to try to kick me out if I am prescribed a dog. \\n I\\'ve done everything I can to assure them that the training will be extensive, and have even asked my dad to build a custom frame for my bed so that I may have the dog\\'s kennel underneath, and store all food, toys, treats, etc in my room as well. The same with my cat. This dog will spend the majority of it\\'s time training with me, playing at the dog park, taking walks, sleeping, or working. I\\'ve even offered for them to bring their dog along to a basic obedience class with whichever dog I get, which is the prereq for service dog training out here, so that the two dogs can get to know each other and learn at the same time should I end up getting a dog. I don\\'t know what else I can do for them. \\n Sorry for rambling. Any advice is welcome.', 'So my dog is 1 year and 3 months old. I\\'ve had him since he was 11 weeks old. He is crate trained and knows a ton of commands. He had some food aggression when I got him that I was not told about by the family I got him from even though I specifically asked about everything that may prevent him from training as a service dog. I decided to keep him anyway, not for service dog purposes, and have worked really hard on his training. I heavily used the leave it command, sit, and lay down whenever he would show food aggression. I almost never see him get aggressive over his food like he used to, and he doesn\\'t slip up too often. \\n Over the last 4 months or so a new problem has started while he\\'s sleeping. He wakes up very easily, like if the cat happens to walk too close to him or something. Sometimes he lets out a small warning growl before snapping at the cat, sometimes not. My immediate gut reaction is to say \"bed,\" and he goes strait to his kennel to continue his nap in there. I haven\\'t even had to say that after the first few times, he just goes strait there after he wakes up freaking out, and many times he goes to his kennel before he even snaps. \\n Tonight he started growling, no cat near him, and I said his name to fully wake him up and make him more aware of where he is, which usually always works. This time though he turned and snapped at me, I tried again to talk to him to get him to snap out of it, but he snapped at me again before going to his kennel. He didn\\'t even put his mouth around my hand or anything, same with the cat. He seems to be posturing if anything. He does sound vicious though as he growl/barks when he snaps, so while I know he\\'s actually a good dog who just got scared for a second and don\\'t find it scary, other people might. \\n I\\'m not sure how to train this out of him like I did with his food aggression. Nothing specific triggers it, it just happens when he wakes up (but not every time) and he typically naps wherever around the house when he feels like napping. Is there a way to train this behavior to help him manage it better? Is he having nightmares maybe? \\n For more about him, he\\'s a husky who is generally an easily startled dog (for some reason he freaking loves it if I hide behind an open door and yell \"boo\" though. It\\'s his favorite gam), noises and sudden movements usually make him go into flight mode for a half second, never fight mode while he\\'s already awake. He loves other dogs more than life itself, loves all people (he always tries to play the chasing game with anyone he meets), and loves to play with the cat throughout the day. \\n What can I do to help him with this?', \"I have low blood pressure issues that can make me pass out after only a few minutes of running, or any other cardio exercise. So I'm avoiding parks and gyms until I can build my endurance up. It's pretty embarrassing when my whole body turns red and sweaty after 2 minutes on a treadmill, and then I have to stop after 10 minutes. It causes me to just avoid exercise. \\n I'm going to be putting a machine in my bedroom so I can exercise more privately. I live in an upstairs condo, so it can't be too big or loud. So treadmill is out. I was debating between a stationary bike or an elliptical because they seem like good and quiet cardio that I can go slowly on for 30+ minutes. Plus if I feel like passing out my bed will be right there waiting for me. :P. \\n Anyway, my question is which would you prefer to get a more efficient workout? I'd like to work out as many parts of my body at once as I can, and I'll alternate my days between the machine and some yoga or strength training. Any advice is welcome. :)\", \"So I adopted an adorable one-eyed hamster girl, of the larger variety last night. She was given to a pet store from a previous owner when their other hamster beat her up. She is super friendly and already ruling over the kitties, who are hilarious afraid of rodents. \\n However, I'm afraid we may have let her have too many blueberries. I just don't want her to get sick. We gave her about 3, cut in half. Which we figured was fine since the rats we have eat a bit more. Then when I read the hamster information site about fruit molding in their pouch I immediately went to take the fruit out of the dish, only to find it missing. \\n Do you think it will be ok? Is there anyway to get food out of her pouch without traumatizing her?\", \"Hello /r/service_dogs, \\n Since my last post I've had my appointments with my therapist and psychiatrist, who both agreed that a service dog could be helpful in my case, and my psychiatrist gave me a note to get one. I also discovered through the help of my therapist that the very bad episodes I am having are not psychosis, but are actually severe anxiety attacks. I wasn't aware that they could get bad enough to alter my perception of reality, but based on her description of anxiety attacks I'd say she's 100% correct. So once I had my doctors note in hand I contacted a trainer to help me with finding a dog that would be suitable for me and my needs, and interviewed with her the following week. \\n Finding a dog feels like it is taking forever, but that may just be because I'm having more anxiety than usual. I've had two anxiety attacks in the last week, one while leaving for work, and one two days later while at work. Luckily my episodes don't last very long when I'm not alone, unfortunately my episodes are impossible to hide. I hyperventilate, shake all over, and scream. I can't seem to control any of that while it's happening, and I always need someone or something there to help me out of it. \\n My roommates had to talk me down from the first one this past week. I made sure to let them know I was approved to get a service dog a week before I met the trainer. We set a day for a roommate meeting that they wanted to have, and I stayed home that entire day. They proceeded to leave the house for the entire day. When they got home one of them immediately went to bed, and the other two decided to drink. \\n After meeting the trainer I mentioned off-handedly that I had done so and that I was in the process of looking for a dog, and my roommate who had originally asked for the meeting told me they don't want me to bring a dog here without a meeting, even though they blatantly missed the first one that they had asked for. \\n I'm not sure what to do, all of our friends tell me to just get the dog, because I've been giving them chances for over a month to have a meeting about this without results, when there is no need to since it is a service dog, and it isn't their decision to make for me. On one hand I don't want to let them bully me into not getting the help that I know that I need, on the other hand, I'm not sure if I'm just not seeing things from their side? \\n To give even more perspective: I've even offered to move out as soon as the dog finishes it's training. My sister has offered to help me buy a home in the next town over so that I can be closer to our family, but since the trainer is here, we think it best to train the dog before I would move.\", 'So I\\'ve had a husky for about a year, since he was 10 weeks old. He ended up having food aggression that the original owners didn\\'t tell me about. \\n I worked with a trainer early on, but the only advice they gave me was how to handle him when he gets in the mindset to avoid getting bit. They didn\\'t have any helpful information on how to stop the aggression, just how to man handle him to avoid getting bit. \\n I worked a lot with him on the \"leave it\" command so I don\\'t have to resort to getting physical with him like that trainer taught me, which is really what would lead to him snapping at me while eating. If he growls I use leave it to make him step away from his food so I can safely take it away from him for a minute or two while he maintains a down position, or we run through other tricks. Occasionally I\\'ll feed him in his kennel if he\\'s having an especially bad time, but I\\'ve stopped this as sometimes he is more protective of his kennel. He\\'s been completely without his kennel for over a week now. \\n This has really helped him, he went from multiple instances everyday to no instances for months. It\\'s been over 4 months since he\\'s snapped at me or another animal, until tonight. \\n His food was sitting next to my bed, and he was sleeping in that corner as well, which was a little odd, because he usually sleeps on the bed whether there is food still in his bowl or not. \\n My cat, sleeping next to my pillow, must have startled him while he was sleeping, because I woke up to his barking growl right when he snapped at the cat. He didn\\'t hurt the cat, didn\\'t even touch him as far as I could tell. I was so angry that he snapped at the cat. He could tell I was upset and that he did something wrong, because he instantly huddled in his corner in the down position and wouldn\\'t move at all. \\n I ended up setting his kennel back up and locking him in it until myself and my cat calmed down, which took about an hour. Then I put away his food and let him back out. He just played with his toys all happy and silly like normal, and the cat went back to ignoring him after a few minutes. \\n I know that I\\'ve made a ton of progress with him in the last year, and would have made more without the bad advice from that trainer. He used to take several minutes to stop the growling and snapping, and now he corrects himself almost instantly, but when he slips up it just kills me. It makes it feel like all of the training was for nothing. \\n I love him and will never ever get rid of him for this, especially since I know he does so much better with training. I just hate the thought that if he ever somehow ended up in a rescue or shelter that he wouldn\\'t be eligible for adopting out, because he\\'d be considered dangerous. He\\'s the sweetest, most playful, and loving dog in all aspects but this. I just wish he didn\\'t have this problem. \\n Sorry guys. It\\'s 4am and I\\'m just frustrated and sad that I had an unfortunate night with him. I just needed to rant.']": "1.

If you want a '\", \"I'm currently training for an Olympic-distance triathlon.  Earlier this spring, I was talking to a friend of a friend at a party and found out she was training for the same distance, albeit a different race, occurring on a similar date.  She mentioned she was doing a local sprint tri as part of her training.  She sold me on the idea and a few weeks later I found myself at the starting line of my first triathlon. \\n I wasn't training for this race specifically and my plan for it was to treat as another training day.  I wanted to do well, obviously, but it was to be a learning experience first and foremost.  I didn't taper, I didn't skip any training in the week before, I just slotted it in instead of the regularly planned long bike ride. \\n This set up for this sprint was a 400 yard swim, 15 mile bike, and a 5K run.  I'm particularly fond of the differing units.  My 'plan' for the race was stick to training paces for the swim and bike, then race the run with whatever I had left.  I've done several brick runs, but never all three and never a full 5K so I wasn't sure what I'd have left.  On paper, I was planning splits of 8/60/24 minutes.  Ignoring transition times, I was hoping race day excitement would push those three times under 90 minutes total. \\n Pre-Race \\n The day before the race was packet pick up.  My bib number was the same date of my birthday, so I figured that for a good omen.  I drove the bike route and discovered it to be much hillier than I anticipated.  Luckily, I have been riding hills once a week so I was hopeful that would translate.  There was a particularly monstrous hill that was most worrying. \\n After getting home I cleaned up my bike and got all my gear out and  played around with a mock transition set up   Packed everything in the car and went to bed at 9pm. \\n Woke up at 5:30 and my body is ready.  I pooped before I even have my coffee (the Sriracha+psyllium the night before worked better than expected.)  I had a bowl of granola and 16oz of coffee with a scoop of whey mixed in as a pre-race meal around 6.  I picked up a Gatorade on the way to the race to sip on beforehand and was on site by 7.  Upon exiting the car, I soon discovered that we had driven 20 minutes across town, including the freeway  without straping my bike into the rack.   How it stayed on the rack is beyond me but my race was almost over before it even started. \\n Anyhoo, after setting up my transition area, I had about 30 minutes to get marked, pick up my chip, test out the water (80^o F), and just relax.  As luck would have it, I ended up 2 bikes away from that friend of a friend in the transition area. \\n After the pre-race meeting participants were organized into our respective waves and we moved to the beach for the start. \\n The Swim (Time -6:52) \\n Ah, the swim.  I tell people that the triathlon is over for me when I get out of the water.  The bike and run are just formalities at that point.  Horror stories abound about the swim portion and given a total lack of confidence in my swimming, I decided to hang in the back at the start and let everyone fight it out while I just did my thing.  Big mistake.  Upon entering the water all I found was a wall of feet.  I'm not fast, but these guys were sloooow.  I quickly changed tactics, swung wide of the group and swam alongside the main pack.  Much better.  I was utterly surprised that I passed so many people on this stage. \\n T1 (Time - 2:16.2) \\n I want to personally thank REI.com for [this page]( solely for the suggestion to roll your socks down to make putting them on easier.  Seriously that made my day.  I also liked the bucket suggestion, but there wasn't enough room for one.  [Though it would have been nice.]( \\n The Bike (Time - 50:39.1) \\n I'm definitely limited by my bike.  It's a cyclocross bike, complete with cyclocross tires and gears.  I got it two months before I decided to do a triathlon, otherwise I'd have gone for a true road bike.  My hill riding definitely paid off, and I was able to make some pretty sweet moves on the downhills and turns, but they were all for naught on the climbs.  The course was pretty technical, it was a three lap route on county blacktops, but I felt really comfortable despite my relative sluggishness.  The monster hill was a monster.  Three times up it were enough for me and I did see one guy actually walking it.  I'm glad I was not that guy.  On the stretch back to the transition area I eased up a bit.  I didn't see the point in shaving seconds off my ride if it was going to add minutes to my run. \\n T2 (Time - 1:37.7) \\n Pretty straight forward here.  Just switching up shoes and turning the number around.  [That bucket would have been really nice]( as my ass was on fire.  I had enough time to bitch about that hill and overhead several others doing the same. \\n The Run (Time - 24:51) \\n As per usual, I started out way too fast off the bike.  But I quickly recognized the error and settled into a pace behind some others that started the run with me.  The run course was 2 laps so it was tough (actually impossible) to know who was pacing for lap 1 and who was on lap 2.  Halfway through lap 1 I outgrew my pacer (who, incidentally I went to high school with) and took off on my own.  On lap 2 I passed my friend of a friend who rounding the halfway point of lap 1.  She was doing well.  [I turned on my kick]( about a quarter mile from the finish and and managed to pass a girl that I had repeatedly traded places with during the bike but who eventually left me behind.  I felt kinda smug about that last minute victory until a few hours later when it dawned on me that she started 2 minutes after me.  Damn wave starts. \\n Total Time: 1:26:16.1 \\n I learned a lot from this race to utilize in my upcoming Olympic.  I'm glad I added into my training schedule.  It was certainly a lot more fun than the 136 minutes bike ride in my training plan. \\n Better positioning in the swim start next time for sure.  I was already planning on getting some road tires for my bike, but they are definitely higher on the priority list after this race. \\n I'm pleased that I beat my transition-exclusive goal with my transition-inclusive time.  Even though I wanted originally 24 minutes on the run, my 'real' goal was 8min miles.  I did manage to hit that, I was just dumb and forgot to include the 0.1mile to that total time.  Still, I'd very much like to whittle that time down. \\n I definitely picked up some confidence that should help we do better at my upcoming Olympic.\", \"I think the sub really improved from almost no submissions and discussions at all to a pretty steady amount. \\n I'm really happy with the way things turned out. \\n >might have to get more mods \\n I've got a few ideas on the back burner at the moment. \\n >deleting more posts and moderation of comment threads if it derails like here. \\n 4realz, I delete  a lot  of posts.

I've gone from not being able to do an overhead squat at all, to now being able to awkwardly get the empty bar up and down.  I don't think I'd be able to do much weight on it though as the bar position is still not ideal. \\n As I was breaking my form down I realized my problem is now more a stability issue.  I just can't maintain an upright back in the bottom of the squat.  So my original question is,  what sort of exercises can I do to help maintain a more upright torso in the hole?   I figure fixing this can only improve my back squats as well. \\n But then I was in the gym on Saturday doing other things and there's that nasty old 2x6 sitting next to the squat rack and suddenly the fucking lightbulb appears over my head.  I'm squatting in minimalist shoes with zero heal raise.  Could this be my problem?  So I put my heels on the board and squatted down.  I could keep my back up straight with no problem whatsoever.  Easy peasy.  So my follow up question is  does proper form on an overhead squat require a raised heel like what olympic lifting shoes provide?  Or is there a way to do it flat footed and I'm back to my original question?\", 'Those who wish to make their core stronger should do what we have always done and squat. \\n [Here is a great article]( about the use and efficacy of unstable training.

This helps you determine what your code should be doing, helps isolate your code, and determine dependencies. You will increase your dev time slightly, but you will make up for it with less bugs, better documentation, and be able to more quickly identify and fix bugs. \\n Check out  by Chris Hartjes, one of the more vocal testing proponents in PHP.

Check out BDD (Behavior Driven Development) as well, and look at the difference between unit tests and integration tests. If you have lots of legacy code don't try and force TDD into your project as you will most likely need lots of refactoring, which will discourage you. By all means make new code as testable as possible, but don't feel like you have to go back and reactor everything at once to make TDD worth it.

I\\'m going to be honest here, especially since you are about to get into the workforce: the vast majority of them suck at finding and placing people. They find anyone they can to try and pawn off on companies in the hopes that they will get the commission for the hire. \\n Recruiters will generally take your resume and pad it to make it fit a job. For example, you say you are 21 years old with 2 years college experience in Java (lets say, I have no idea what you went for) and you\\'ve dabbled in C# and Ruby for GUI apps and web development. A recruiter gets a job offer for a C# job requesting a senior dev with 5 years experience will contact you and then change your resume to reflect what the job offer is. Now you have your main experience in C#, .NET, Windows Programming, and some Java experience. \\n My resume used to have all the languages I work with. I still get e-mails for .NET stuff, even though PHP is my main language. I\\'ve come across one good recruiter who actually read my resume and wanted to offer me a position that was in line with what I was looking for. The other 99% are just looking for a body to make them a commission. \\n > I would say that the term \"senior\" is more of a buzzword than anything. For instance, if you were in the toilet paper business and all of your competitors started using the term \"ultra soft\" in their marketing, you would probably start using the term, too, because you don\\'t want your toilet paper to be considered the shittiest of the lot (pun intended). \\n They treat \\'senior\\' as a buzzword like \\'Code Ninja\\' or \\'Rockstar Programmer\\' instead of what it really means - someone who has advanced beyond a junior programmer, has the ability to design programs, and real-world experience with 5+ years in a given field. Junior devs generally get handed specs to code against, not get to write the specs. \\n The problem with this analogy is that one is truly a marketing term, and the other is a tiered set requirements. I\\'ve always felt the strata breaks down like this: \\n \\n Junior Dev - Fresh out of school, very limited experience. Should be given clear instructions to follow while gaining real-world experience. \\n Senior Dev - Has the capability to be given a functional spec and can create a technical spec. For example, \"Customer needs a C# app that does A, B, C\", and turn it into \"C# 2010 code using these models, these forms, ...\" \\n Architect - Knowledge of various methodologies. Generally looks at the big picture and designs a system from scratch using various components. Take very high level specs \"We need a CRM\" and turns it into \"Use PHP running on CentOS, PostgreSQL, and XYZ file format specification\" \\n \\n Teams are then made up of different mixtures of the above, some being lead developers in charge of projects. \\n > The same goes for recruiting. No recruiter wants their position to appear less appealing to job seekers (or engineers looking to move around) simply because their position isn\\'t a \"senior\" position. \\n This again is a problem with recruiters in general. They are more interested in finding someone to just fill the slot. If a company is looking to hire a junior dev and the recruiter places the ad looking for a senior dev, his job candidates will go into the interview and get offered a job junior position pay. That\\'s a waste of everyone\\'s time.', \"Here's the dirty little secret about REST APIs - most of the time if someone says they have a REST API, they don't.

This means GETing a resource to view it, PUTing a resource to update/create it, DELETEing a resource, and POSTing to collections to create new resources. If you use one verb to do multiple jobs, you don't have a rest server. REST APIs also make heavy use of the headers for content negotiation, so if you have to pass that you want XML back in the query string, you aren't using a fully RESTful API. \\n REST-Like APIs* \\nTake Twitter. If you are using real REST, you wouldn't specify your output via the URL query, that's a job for the headers in your request. You would also make use of all of the verbs, not just GET and POST. \\n Does the URI have an action in the name (statuses/destroy/:id is one example)? Most like it isn't a REST API. \\n Do you use POST for more than creating information? Again, statuses/destroy/:id uses POST, but this would actually be handled by a DELETE verb in a real REST architecture. If you wanted to get a tweet, the endpoint would be GET /statuses/:id, not GET /statuses/show/:id. To add a tweet, you would POST /statuses, not POST /statuses/update. \\n This is a valid set of REST endpoints (which are not all valid Twitter endpoints): \\n GET /statuses\\nPOST /statuses\\nDELETE /statuses/:id\\nGET /user_timeline\\n \\n These are not: \\n POST /direct_messages/destroy/:id\\nGET /friends/ids\\nPOST /friendships/create\\n \\n RPC-Servers \\n Many other APIs that call themselves REST are actually RPC servers. This is a modification of the normal XML-RPC server, where you send a block of XML to a single endpoint which contains a method and parameters. REST API's that tend to be like RPC servers have endpoints that look like function names, but only ever support POST. \\n Flickr is somewhat guilty of this, having endpoints like 'flickr.groups.discuss.replies.delete', which take a POST command and arguments in the URL. If the endpoints are basically names of functions, and everything else is passed via the query string, you have an RPC server masquerading as a REST API. \\n The Web As a REST API \\n In a basic sense, the web browser and web server act as a REST client and server, respectively. You issue GET commands for resources, and they are returned to you. The browser and the server negotiate the content type via the headers. You just never see that. Where is starts to break down is when sites return bad HTTP responses for things, like 200 for failed logins, or not supporting DELETE for PUT. The web itself, when looked at from a browser/server point of view, is REST-like, but not actually REST.\"]": "Based on the user's postings, it appears that they are interested in web development, programming languages, frameworks (such as symfony2 and Zend Framework 2), software testing (specifically TDD and BDD), intellectual property (copyright and licensing), cybersecurity (penetration testing), job recruitment and the different levels of developers, and REST APIs.", "['EDIT : [Buddy matching]( survey--please fill out to give some feedback about your experience! \\n \\n Hello again! \\n Matching is...complete! You can view the matches [here]( for your name if you don\\'t see it right away! \\n Here\\'s what happened: I sorted the responses based on age, sex, and time zone preferences. Then I tried to match people up based on their primary and secondary goals, taking into account weight loss goals, where you are in life, and any other information you gave me. If you said you were a 24-30y.o. female who wanted to lose 20lbs and work on your career, I tried to match you with someone who, on paper, had similar goals. Hopefully, this gives you some things in common to start chatting about!

What you chat about is up to you--talk about your goals, your struggles, successes, favorite dogs, this crazy food you just ate, set up a challenge to do with your buddy...whatever you feel comfortable talking about! \\n \\n \\n I very quickly realized that there were several types of questions that would have been helpful to include in the initial survey.

I love reading these posts every morning to start my day off on a positive note. Check out our goal-oriented subreddit for more daily motivation as we start Round 14! \\n \\n About three years ago, a group of Redditors decided to change their lives at /r/90daysgoal. We just wrapped up Round 13! \\n With thirteen successful rounds under our (much) smaller belts, we\u2019re excited to start Round 14 and we\u2019re hoping others will join in. \\n What 90days is and what it isn\u2019t \\n This isn\u2019t a set diet or exercise routine. This isn\u2019t a competition with prizes (check out /r/BTFC for that). This is a group of people working together to better themselves. Whether you want to change a lot or a little, gain muscle or lose weight, or work on things that aren\\'t necessarily related to fitness, everyone is welcome. More than anything else, this group will provide you with a place to talk to other people about health, fitness, and general self-improvement in a completely open and friendly environment. No question is too basic here. \\n What\u2019s the format? \\n Every morning the mods post a Daily Goal thread where you can post your goals, ask questions, or read through other people\u2019s updates. There\\'s a weekly check-in thread every Monday and several themed posts (Runners, Women Losing Weight) throughout the week to keep us all on track. \\n If you\\'d like to join us for the next round, stop by and tell us about yourself and your goals in the [official introduction thread] ( Round 14 will officially begin on Monday, June 16th. On Day 1 there will be a signup form to fill out so that we can keep track of group statistics. Group and individual progress will be posted at the end of each month using a display name based on your age, gender, height, and weight (we\\'ll describe how to decipher it all later). \\n What are these sprints I keep hearing about? \\n You\\'ll see the word \"sprints\" thrown around quite a lot.  Don\\'t worry, we\\'re not going to force anyone to go sprinting.  Sprints are what we do to make it easier to stick to the whole 90 days!  We\\'ve split the 90 days into 3 sprints, each one 30 days long plus a 5 day rest period in between.  Why did we do this?  Well, we found out that more people stuck around if they could focus on their goals for shorter periods of time and then have a short rest before resuming.  When you set your goals, you can not only set goals for the entire 90 days, but also for each sprint! \\n What\\'s the schedule? \\n Sprint 1:  June 16 - July 15 \\n Recovery:  July 16 - July 20 \\n Sprint 2:  July 21 - August 19 \\n Recovery:  August 20 - August 24 \\n Sprint 3:  August 25 - September 23', \"Woo June!

It was so good, though. The BF's leaving for a week-long camping trip, so I wanted to make him a nice dinner before he lives on canned beans and jerky all week. I got a suggestion for stir-fry on here last week, but he said he was in the mood for a casserole (and said I should use the dish my mom got me for Christmas that I hadn't used yet...lol). And then we got these delicious strawberries at the FM and I just thought a simple chocolate cake dusted with powdered sugar would be the perfect companion. He had two pieces so I'd say it was a success. \\n Today  will involve a Dr. Who marathon while I tackle piecing this afghan together, then lifting later and continuing the quest for a zipper foot. \\n Since I'm all alone  this week  I'm going to take this opportunity to get mega swole/make a lot of afghan progress.

Before it was always a family dog, for the most part my mom trained and fed the dog etc while we cleaned up after them and played with them - but most of the dogs behavior was on my mom. When I got my dog 2 years ago I started doing a lot of breed research. Initially I wanted a big dog and really wanted a husky or malamute (still do but its not feasible yet). \\n I made a list of what I wanted my dog to be able to do. For me I wanted a dog that played fetch, was smart, good at learning tricks, and could eventually be taken off leash without fear of it running away forever. Due to my living situation (second floor apartment aka no yard), still being in college (aka crazy hours) and it being my first dog, I decided against a husky. \\n Just a couple things to consider: \\n -Where do you live? Not all dogs are suited to apartment life - huskies notoriously aren't \\n -How long are you gone during the day? Will your dog be stuck at home for hours on end by himself? If you don't entertain them enough some dogs will chew or bark all day \\n -Have you been around a dog that sheds? Does having hair on everything bother you? I have a corgi and during the spring and fall she sheds like 3x her body weight in fur \\n -Are you looking for a guard dog? There is a difference between guard and watch dogs. Huskies are not guard dogs, corgi's are great watch dogs - they will bark at any stranger(or unknown sound that is with in earshot) \\n -Do you plan on moving away from NZ any time soon or with in the next 10-15 years? If so wait on getting a dog, you've had to leave one behind already \\n -If you go out of town who will watch your dog? You'll either have to take him with you or find someone to watch him \\n Getting a dog isn't impossible. Consider you situation carefully before getting one though. If you don't live alone make sure everyone you live with is ok with you getting a dog.  Also don't be dissappointed when YOUR dog decides she likes you mom/dad/significant other/best friend better than you. \\n Once you've decided what you want from your dog, go find a breed selector quiz online and see what dog breed suit your lifestyle.\", 'I cut out (or at least cut way back) dairy in my first semester of college, I am lactose sensitive and when I get stressed I become intolerant. I was eating particularly healthy before I cut out dairy, and cutting it out forced me to think about what i was eating and make sure it wasn\\'t going to incapacitate me for a while. I stopped have cereal for breakfast everyday, no more glasses of milk to drink, no ice cream for dessert etc. I ended up losing a fair amount of weight, but that was an overall diet change that was sparked by cutting out/back on dairy. \\n I think a lot of dairy has a lot of fat, at least what I\\'d always had when I was home (my mom refused to by anything but whole or 2% milk and nothing that said \"Low-fat\" because it \"tastes gross\"). When I cut it out i was dropping a lot of fat from my diet, and the milk i did buy was specially for the lactose intolerant and was pricey so I was stingy with it.', \"Hey I just wanted to chime in because the same sort of thing happened to me at the end of April. I started working out March and was going strong through April, and really loving what I was doing. \\n Then at the end of April someone ran a red light and smashed into my car, spinning me around and causing me to hit the car next to me. My car was totalled, the car I hit was totalled and the car that hit me (which was a fucking truck while I was driving a Kia rio) was not in good shape. \\n Like you I was able to walk away from my car, and thank god so were my dogs who were sitting in the back seat. I have had no lasting injuries although we thought my hand might've been broken (xrays said I was fine though). \\n I took a week off from lifting at all, I was sore and woke up stiff and I was just so tired. When I finally went back my lifts weren't great and I found some new places I was sore. I started back slowly, instead of every day/every other day, I only went 2 or 3 times a week. \\n Then I got sick. I had a fever and sore throat which turned into a terrible cough. It wouldn't go away, the cough stuck around and stuck around. After a week started to go away, but I still couldn't do any strenuous activity without turning into some emphysema patient. Another week to week and a half later my cough finally went away and I could work out again. \\n I basically ended up taking all of May off, unless you count moving for a week as a workout lol. I finally started to get back at it in the last week or two. I've been getting antsy from not lifting heavy things and I finally got a new car (a badass Jeep ;) ) so things are starting to be semi-normal.\", \"A little background: My boyfriend has 2 maltese. A 4 year old male and a 3 year old female. Both dogs are fixed. When we started dating, his dogs were nightmares, they really didn't have any rules and he would occasionally yell at them when they did something he didn't like. They were not potty trained,  crate trained or obedience trained. His male was extremely territorial and possessive with my boyfriend. Any time someone that wasn't my boyfriend got up, they would bark and nip at your heels. \\n We had a lengthy and heated discussion about how his dogs acted and how it was completely inappropriate and I didn't like his dogs because of the way they acted. I told him he needed to take control of his dogs, no more free feeding, start some obedience training and potty training. They have improved a lot, but they still have issues and I don't know how to fix them. \\n His male is the worst, he is moderately aggressive and has separation anxiety whenever my boyfriend leaves. My corgi and him were getting into daily scuffles trying to establish top dog. It took a couple times to let them figure it out, my boyfriend wanted to step in because he was afraid Chandler would get hurt. They have less scuffles, now only related to Chandler trying to steal a toy or trying to keep my corgi off the bed. \\n He is still territorial (mostly when we're on the bed). He will place himself inbetween my boyfriend and myself, at which point I remove him and place him at the foot of them bed. He doesn't growl as often, but still does sometimes. Aside from flipping the dog on his back and keeping him pinned until he submits, what can we do? \\n I do not know what to do about the separation anxiety. I've never encountered a dog that acts so pitiful when his owner leaves. He sits at the door whining and pawing at it. If he cannot get to where my boyfriend is (gated in another room) he has destroyed carpet and baby gate alike to get out. We've tried walking in and out of the house. He cries and barks everytime. I suggested taking them for a brisk morning walk/run but I don't think it was worth it to him. \\n Part of the problem is that he doesn't see their behavior as problematic as I do. I know its small dog syndrome and I know he's the reason they have it. Slowly I've been opening his eyes to how a dog should act, but until then the behaviors will continue. I want to like my boyfriends dogs, I want them to act like well behaved, well adjusted dogs. I just don't know how to train small dogs beyond what I've already done. They have bad habits and I don't know how to fix them. \\n EDIT:\", \"When I was a kid we had a beagle and she ended up having a lot of skin problems and had to have expensive medicine that my parents couldn't afford anymore. We ended up taking her to the pound, I remember that happening we were all in the car and said good bye to her. A couple days later my mother told my sister and I that she was adopted by a nice old lady that lived next door to a farm and Dixie got to chase chickens all day. It wasn't until I was 21 that I was retelling this story and realized that my childhood dog had more than likely gotten put down. Granted since this realization I haven't brought it up to my parents because I like to think Dixie did get to go laze around with some old lady. \\n My mom, who swears she doesn't remember this, but told me her and my father were aliens. I must have been really young (5 or younger) and whole heartedly believed it. I would try and sneak in to my parents bedroom and catch them in 'Alien-form'. Thank God I never caught them doing the dirty dragon dance, although that probably would have just solidified the fact that I thought they were aliens. \\n Growing up we had a neighbor that would mow his lawn several times a week and would always wear headphones. I told my younger sister that he wore them so his head didn't blow up. Apparently she believed me and really hated being outside when ever he'd mow the lawn.\", 'In my opinion whenever you switch doctors it goes a little slow.

Save up at least half of what you\\'ll need, more is better, to get a pet snake before you bring it up to your mom again. \\n b) Make a list of all the things you\\'ll need. Enclosure, thermometer, heater, thermostat etc with prices. Also consider on going prices of bedding and food. \\n c) Make another list with all care requirements. Temps, humidity, what to do if something goes wrong. \\n d) AFTER you have saved up some money, go to petsmart with your mom and ask to hold one of the snakes. You aren\\'t buying anything right now, just testing the waters. \\n e) find out why your mom hates snakes so much, they bite? creepy? thinks they\\'re slimy? IF its something rational you can explain \"ohh all animals bite\" or \"the snake I want doesn\\'t get very big\" etc \\n f) Even if you act responsibly and talk through it with your mom she might still say no. If so, sorry you\\'ll have to wait until you\\'re older. I did, and now I can save up for a really cool morph ;) \\n g) I used to work at petsmart, don\\'t buy a BP from petsmart if you can help it. Depending on where you live there might be a reptile show nearby. The prices are better and the snakes come from people that know what they are doing. \\n If it upsets you to see a snake in a cage/tank/bin etc maybe you shouldn\\'t have one as a pet. I had a BP for a little while who lived in a 20 gallon long tank. and then that was a pain in the butt to clean so I moved him to a bin cage (highly recommend this.) \\n You can do some more research at ball-pythons.net its a great forum with lots of really experienced people. \\n Above all, do not, repeat DO NOT, whine, bitch or complain if your mom says no. It is only going to reinforce that she made the right decision. Pitching a fit or pleading all that crap, will only make it take longer for you to get a snake.']": "Based on the summarization of the reddit postings, it seems that the user is primarily interested in:\n1.
